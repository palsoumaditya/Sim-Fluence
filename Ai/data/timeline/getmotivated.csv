It’s [the one that I will wear on my funeral](http://i.imgur.com/Ln8Yyqf.jpg?1) a few months from now. It may not match my suit, but I think it’s perfect for the occasion. 

The cancer diagnosis came too late to give me at least a tenuous hope for a long life, but I realized that the most important thing about death is to ensure that you leave this world a little better than it was before you existed with your contributions . The way I’ve lived my life so far, my existence or more precisely the loss of it, will not matter because I have lived without doing anything impactful.

Before, there were so many things that occupied my mind.  When I learned how much time I had left, however, it became clear which things are really important. So, I am writing to you for a selfish reason. I want to give meaning to my life by sharing with you what I have realized:

* Don’t waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy.
It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like.
Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do.

* It’s stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. Listen to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend.

* Take control of your life
Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. **Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.**

* Appreciate the people around you
Your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. 

It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. 

I'm not upset because I understand that the last days of my life have become meaningful. I only regret that I will not be able to see a lot of cool stuff that should happen soon like the creation of AI, or Elon Musk’s next awesome project. I also hope that the war in Syria and Ukraine will end soon.

We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it.  

You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. 
I hope you will make the right choice.

Leave a mark in this world. 
Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are leaving is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count!

Thank you!

I've seen some pretty loathsome things - people trying to demotivate myself and others from achieving their goals, disparaging me for potentially inspiring someone to harm themselves if they can't make those goals.

I've seen struggle and words of reinforcement. People who are going through all kinds of heart break and loss, people searching their souls for worth and identity, and those of you who've admitted to falling short of their own expectations

More than all of those combined, I've seen victories and new goals set.  'Victory,' to me, means you accomplished something, you're carrying on, or you've been invigorated with renewed energy to push forward.

To the demotivators, I'm so sorry you felt the need to try and drive the hopes and dreams of others away, especially on this thread. Sure, front page, visible to everyone, I must have been asking for it. Honestly, I took your words as reverse psychology, regardless of your intent. Communities like this carry on because we find our motivation from within - and your influence isn't a part of that. 

To the strugglers - don't listen to the detractors. Your efforts will pay off in the end, even if they need adjustment over time. Plan change, and they can be hard, but the goals can still be attained. No voice - supportive or not - should be louder than your internal mantra. You win because *you* want to. Everyone else can eat dust.

To the accomplished, or the nearly there - you don't need anything from me but an enthusiastic high five. You know what you're doing and you're succeeding. Bloody well done.

I'm so happy to have had a moment in the sunshine of your lives (or the gloomy clouds, depending on your outlook). You've impressed and inspired me well beyond my own expectations.

I want to put together a sub maybe called /r/One_Hundred_Days or /r/Keep_Going, but I know nothing about CCS or integrating any kind of bots people could use to track their efforts and create a wholesome community of positive support, with enough Mods that can deter the inevitable troll. If you want to do this with me, or without, please let me know. I strongly believe that community can succeed and be a great example to others.

Thank you, everyone, and especially the mods of /r/GetMotivated for keeping this place relatively free of the despairing.

Most of all, Keep Going"

##Week 1: What is Learning?
---

&nbsp;  
**Brain Facts:**

* Cells of the nervous system are called neurons. Information from one neuron flows to another neuron across a synapse. Human brain has a million billion synapses.

* Your brain creates synapses whenever you learn something new. Sleeping helps ""update"" your brain cells. Literally.

&nbsp;  
**Why do we procrastinate (scientifically):**

**Problem:**

Learning a new thing or doing something you would rather not do can be stressing. This can cause anxiety at first. This activates the area associated with pain in the brain.

Your brain looks for a way to stop that negative feeling by switching your attention to something else more pleasant.

**Solution:**

The trick is to just start. Researchers discovered that not long after people start actually working out what they didn’t like, that neuro-discomfort disappeared. 

Remember that the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.

Consider using the pomodoro technique.

&nbsp;  
**Learning hard and abstract things:**

The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice to create and strengthen neural connections to bring the abstract ideas to reality for you.

**Ex**: You should practice a lot with the math vocabulary to understand it and recall it easier.
[∫∞e^x dx, k!(n−k)!]


&nbsp;  
**Summary of what I learnt:**

1. There are two modes of thinking:

    1. **Focused mode:** Concentrating on things that are usually familiar.

    2. **Diffused mode:** A relaxed mode of thinking ""your thoughts are free to wander"".

2. When you don’t desire doing/learning something, go through it and just start. The discomfort goes away and, in the long term, this will lead to satisfaction.

3. When you learn something new, make sure to take time to rest, then come back to it and recall what you learnt. 

    3. This is very important. Don’t cram information in one day. This leads to inefficient learning. It’s like building a wall without letting it dry.

    4. Revisiting and practicing what you learn is important. Research shows that **spaced repetition** (repeating things after few days) is the best way to build and strengthen the synaptic connections.

4. Sleep is very important. It clears the metabolic toxins from the brain after a day of ""brain use"". It is best to sleep directly after learning new things.

5. It was shown that exercising and/or being in a rich social environment helps your brain produce new neurons. Don’t lock yourself in your room. Stay active and spare time for exercise (including general physical activities) and friends daily.

##Week 2: Chunking
---

&nbsp;  

**Chunks:**

Pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, bond together through use and meaning. They can get bigger and more complex, but at the same time, they are single easy to access items that can fit into the slot of the working memory. 

* **Chunking** is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access.

* **Example**: If you understand and practice a math formula. You no longer will need to focus much to solve it like you did the first time. That’s because your ""formula chunk"" got so abstracted into your brain that it can only take one slot of your working memory to solve it.

&nbsp;  
**Turn off distractions**. You want to use all the four slots of your working memory when studying. Learning will be inefficient if some of those slots are connected to something else.

&nbsp;  
**You have to solve the problem yourself.** Just because you see it, or even understand it, doesn't mean that you will be able to solve it (**Illusion of competence**). It is always easier to look at the material, even if you think it’s easy, then doing it yourself.

&nbsp;  
**It gets easier.** When you think that a chapter or a book has too much information and that there’s no way to go through them all; just focus on whatever section you’re studying. You’ll find that once you put that first concept in your mental library, the following one will be easier.

This concept is called **Transfer**; a chunk you have mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn other chunks of information in different areas.

&nbsp;  
**Master the major idea** and then start getting deeper. However, make sure not to get stuck in some details before having a general idea. Practice to help yourself gain mastery and sense of the big picture context. Try taking a ""picture walk"" before you dig through the material, this means, look briefly at the pictures, chapter titles, formulas used… before diving into details.

&nbsp;  
**Recall mentally** without looking at the material. This is proven more effective than to simply rereading. Reread only after you try to recall and write down what was in the material.

Consider recalling when you are in different places to become independent of the cues from any giving location. This will help you when taking a test in the class.

&nbsp;  
**Test yourself** to make sure you are actually learning and not fooling yourself into learning. Mistakes are a good thing. They allow you to catch illusions of competence. 

&nbsp;  
**Don’t always trust your initial intuition. Einstellung** problem (a German word for Mindset). An idea or a neural pattern you developed might prevent a new better idea from being found. Sometimes your initial intuition on what you need to be doing is misleading.You’ve to unlearn old ideas and approaches as you are learning new ones.

&nbsp;  
**Mix up the problems (Interleaving)** from different chapters. This is helpful to create connections between your chunks. It can make your learning a bit more difficult, but it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is very important. It is where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
**Don’ts:**

* Highlighting too much and creating maps are often ineffective without recalling.

* Repeating something you already learnt or know very well is **easy**. It can bring the **illusion of competence**; that you’ve mastered the full material when you actually just know the easy stuff. Balance your studies and focus on the more difficult (**deliberate practice**). This sets the difference between a good student and a great student.

* A big mistake is to blindly start working on an exercise without reading the textbook or attending the class. This is a recipe of sinking. It’s like randomly allowing a thought to pop off in the focus mode without paying attention to where the solution truly lies.

##Week 3: Procrastination and Memory
---

&nbsp;  

**Procrastination:**

* The routine, habitual responses your brain falls into when you try to do something hard or unpleasant. Focusing only on making the present moment feels better.

* Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, Willpower is hard to come by. It uses a lot of neural resources and you shouldn’t waste it on fending off procrastination except when really necessary. You actually don’t need to.

* The long-term effect of Procrastination can be dangerous. Putting your studies off leads to studying becoming even more painful. Procrastination is a habit that affects many areas of your life, if you improve in this area, many positive changes will unfold.

* Procrastination shares features with addiction. At first, it leads you to think that if you study too early you’ll forget the material. Then, when the class is ahead of you, it leads you to think that you are inadequate or that the subject is too hard.

* You want to avoid cramming which doesn’t build solid neural structures, by putting the same amount into your learning, and spacing it over a long period by starting earlier.

&nbsp;  
**First time learning something:**

* The first time you do something the deluge of information coming at you would make the job seem almost impossibly difficult. But, once you've chunked it, it will be simple. 

* At first, it's really hard, later it's easy. It becomes like a habit. **Ex:** Driving for the first time.

&nbsp;  
**Habits:**

* Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit.

* Habit is an energy saver. You don’t need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.

* Habits can be good or bad, brief or long.

&nbsp;  
**Habits Parts:**

1. **The cue**: The trigger that launches you into zombie mode (habitual routine).

    1. Recognize what launches you in zombie procrastination mode:

        1. Location. Time. Feelings. Reaction to people or events…

    2. Consider shutting your phone/internet for brief periods of time to prevent most cues.

2. **The routine**: Routine you do in reaction to the cue.

    3. You only need to use your willpower to change your reaction to the cues.

    4. Actively focus on rewiring your old habits.

        2. You need a plan. You need some willpower.

3. **The reward**: Habits exist because they reward us.

    5. Give yourself bigger rewards for bigger achievements. But after you finish them.

        3. **Ex**: If I study for 4 hours today, I’ll watch a movie, guilt free, at night.

    6. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.

    7. Only once your brain starts expecting a reward will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.

4. **The belief**: To change your habits, you need to change your underlying belief.

    8. **Ex**: You might feel like you’ll never be able to change the habit of studying late. This is not true. You can actually rewire your brain

    9. Joining a student community helps, either online or in real life.

    10. Trust your system. You have to feel happy and worry-free when you are resting.

&nbsp;  
**Weekly/Daily list:**

* Researchers showed that writing your daily list the **evening before** helps you accomplish them the next day. If you don’t write them down, they will take the valuable slots of memory.

* Plan your finishing time, this is as important as planning your working time.

* Work in the most important and most disliked task first, even if it’s only one pomodoro.

* Take notes about what works and what doesn’t.

* Have a backup plan for when you will still procrastinate.

 

&nbsp;  
**Focus on Process:**

You should realize that it’s perfectly normal to start a learning session with a negative feeling even if you like the subject. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

**Solution**: Focus on the process, not the product. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead of saying ""I will solve this task today"", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.

&nbsp;  
**Memory:**

* Use your visual memory to remember things.  

    * **Ex**: Link a memorable picture to a formula.

* Images help you encapsulate a very hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.

* The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses the easier it will be for you to recall the concept.

* Keep repeating what you want to learn so that the metabolic toxins won’t suck away the neural patterns related to that memory. **Spaced repetition** is the key.

* **Flashcards** help. Consider using Anki.

* **Handwriting** helps you deeply convert what you are trying to learn into neural memory structures.

&nbsp;  
**Memory Techniques:**

* Create meaningful groups and abbreviations.

* To remember numbers, associate them to memorable events.

* Create mnemonic phrases from first letters of the words you want to remember.

* **Memory Palace Technique**: Use a familiar place (like the blueprint of your house) and associate visual images of things you want to remember with physical places.

    * This is not easy. You’ll be very slow at first. But with practice, you’ll get better.

    * The more you practice your ""memory muscle"" the easier you’ll remember.

##Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
---

&nbsp;  


**You should know:**

* Exercising is by far more effective than any drug to help you learn better. It helps new neurons survive.

* Learning doesn't always progress linearly and logically. Inevitably your brain will hit a knowledge-collapse sometimes. This usually means your brain is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.

* You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.

&nbsp;  
**Metaphors**

* Metaphors and analogies are very helpful, not only to memorize, but to also understand different concepts.

* It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.

&nbsp;  
**Intelligence:**

* Intelligence does matter. Being smart usually equate to having a large working memory (more than just four slots). 

* However, a super working memory can hold its thoughts so tightly that new thoughts won’t easily find a way into the brain. Such a tightly controlled attention could use an occasional breath of ADHD. You attention shifts even if you don’t want it to shift.

* **Deliberate practice** is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted. Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.

* Brilliant scientist like Ramón y Cajal, the father of neuroscience, or Charles Darwin, were not exceptionally gifted. The key to their success was **perseverance, taking responsibility for their learning and changing their thoughts.**

* Take pride in the qualities you excel at. Tune people out if they try to demean your efforts.

&nbsp;  
**Right hemisphere:**

* Helps us put our work into the big picture perspective and does reality checks.

* When you go through a homework or test questions and don’t go back to check your work, you’re acting like a person who’s refusing to use parts of his brain.

&nbsp;  
**Left hemisphere:**

* Interprets the world for us but with a tendency for rigidity, dogmatism and egocentricity.

* May lead to overconfidence. **Ex:** believing dismissively that your answers are corrects.

&nbsp;  
**Best practices:**

* Always step back and recheck to takes advantages of abilities of both-hemispheres interactions.

* Brainstorm and find focused people to analyze your work with. 

    * Your errors are sometimes easier to be found by others. 

    * Explaining yourself to others helps you understand more.

    * Studying in a team helps you catch what you missed, or what you can’t see.

* Don’t fool yourself. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities. Having a team can bring those projections down.

&nbsp;  
**Test Checklist:**

* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? If you had a study guide, did you go through it?

* Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?

* Did you understand all your homework problems’ solutions? If not, did you ask for explanations?

* Did you work with classmates on homework problems? checked your solutions?

* Did you consult your instructor/teacher when you had a problem with something?

* Did you sleep well the night before the test?

&nbsp;  
**Test Taking Technique: Hard Start - Jump to easy:** (Try this strategy with homework problems first) 

1. Take a quick look at the test when it’s handed to you to get a sense of what it involves.

2. Start with the hardest problem. Pull yourself out if you get stuck for over 2 minutes. *Starting with a hard problem loads your focused mode first and then switches attention away from it. This allows the diffused mode to start its work.*

3. Turn next to an easy problem. Solves what you can, then move back to a hard one. *This allows the different part of your brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts.*

&nbsp;  
**Taking Test Tips:**

* Being Stressed before a test is normal. The body puts ups out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret the body reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. 

    * Shift your thinking from ""I am afraid of this test"" to “I am excited to do my best”.

* If you are stressed during a test, turn your attention to breathing. Relax, put your hand on your stomach and slowly draw some deep breaths. This will calm you down.

* Relax your brain on the last day before a test. Have a quick final look at the materials. Feeling guilty the last day is a natural reaction even if you prepared well. So relax.

* Good worry motivates you. Bad worry wastes your energy.

* Double check your answers. Look away, shift your attention, and then recheck.

4vfiju,[text] Three Simple Ideas that Changed My Life,20243,0.87,900,2016-07-31 09:16:00,GetMotivated,22875553,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4vfiju/text_three_simple_ideas_that_changed_my_life/,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/4vfiju/text_three_simple_ideas_that_changed_my_life/,self.GetMotivated,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I've been wanting to write down these ideas for awhile in the hopes that someone else might find them useful. I know this sub has a tendency toward contrarianism, and I certainly do not intend these ideas to be ""universal"" - but just wanted to present these things that have personally worked for me and can maybe benefit someone else. If I slip into direct address and say ""you"" - I'm really just referring to myself. 

Long story short - about two years ago, I hated where I was in life. It was the recognition of these three ideas that kept me going and helped me to turn my life around. I should add that these ideas aren't original, but things that I've come across during that time and paraphrased one way or another.  

**1. The human being is meant to bear the burden of 24 hours -- no more, no less.** If you live in the future, you will get anxious; if you live in the past, you will get depressed. Twenty four hours is all that you have to live in. Give up all the other burdens to the universe, to god, to your cat, to whatever - but the burdens of the past are not yours. The burdens of the future aren't yours either. Let them go. The day is your material. It's what's in front of you, it's the only thing that you have the power to change or to shape or to use. It's your canvas. It's your material. So use it well. 

**2. Happiness is not something you can pursue - but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing.** We get so tripped up thinking that happiness is an end goal -- and then get frustrated when it slips through our fingers. Instead, focus on whatever the right thing is - and happiness will follow. Feel like shit at the end of the day? Maybe it's because you ate a tub of ice cream for dinner, forgot to call your mom back, blew off homework to play video games, etc. On the surface, those are all things that should make you ""happy"" - but I've found that when I'm feeling most depressed, its usually a factor of actions I either did or (more likely) did not do. If you're passively waiting for happiness to wash over you like a wave -- it's not going to happen.  Instead, take action, do whatever the ""right thing"" is, and that feeling of warmth and fulfillment will follow of its own accord. 

**3. The world's idea of success is total shit.** Don't get sucked into it. On television, on the street, when talking with friends or family - it seems like everyone confuses the concept of rewards with success itself. Whether it's money, fame, recognition, praise, sex, the rewards are not up to you -- they are all dependent on someone else. Instead, think of success as sustained effort of will. It begins and ends with YOU, and no one else. Think of any fantasy or goal you may have -- say you've always wanted to be a great artist. Imagine it. What does that look like? I guarantee you're thinking about palling around in paris with beautiful women and having your art work admired in galleries and being given the nobel prize - basically you're fantasizing about *having been* a great artist and not *actually making the art*. That way of thinking can totally mess you up because it once again puts the emphasis on passive recognition over active, sustained effort. The more you shift focus onto your own actions, the more you create sustained effort, and the more likely it is that the rewards will follow.

Lastly, as a bit of an addendum - **it's good to remember the difference between stopping and quitting.** This helps me when I'm feeling a bit lost or down on myself -- or during those times when I've just chucked these three ideas to the wind and sat on the couch all day instead. If you've ever strayed from what you feel you were supposed to do or who you were supposed to be - remember that everyone has to stop. Whatever it is we're doing, whatever our grand ambitions are in life, we stop. We have to stop. We have to take a piss, or go to bed, or go on vacation, or we have a kid and not have much time to ourselves etc. *But quitting is stopping without ever beginning again.* So as long as you're here, as long as you're alive and pulling air through your lungs, you can begin again. And if you begin again, then you haven't quit. So fucking begin again. 

Hope this helps someone out there. "

You will still be you, except you won't be. Think back to the 2014 version of you. I bet you can barely recognize that person. Whether you're doing it intentionally or not, people change. You changed, and you will continue to change.

&#x200B;

We overestimate what we can do in one year and underestimate what we can do in five. It's so easy to think ""This is my year!"" or ""In 2019, I'm going to do X"", but a year really isn't all that much time. It's already April. Time flies. But you probably realized from thinking about your 2014 self that a lot changes in five years.

&#x200B;

In five years, you can be living a whole new life. You could have a family, a new career, live in a new country, or be that person you've always wanted to be who works out all the time and actually likes eating vegetables. All you need to do to get there is start working now. Start small, but start now.

&#x200B;

Don't get stuck thinking that you have tons of time. Remember how we're already into the fourth month of 2019? This year will be over before you know it. Get started. Small changes made every day for five years will amount to big things, and that time will pass whether you're using it or not.

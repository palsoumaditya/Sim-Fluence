The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**

AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.

This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.

With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.

We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.

A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.
* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

With love,

We have understandably been getting a heavy increase in political posts, but they’ve been slowly overloading the sub. We want to give users a break from such posts, especially since multiple people have reached out to us about this issue.

While there have been civil discussions around these and other similar topics, we as a mod team have found that most discussions around US politics devolve into slapfights and insults. Therefore, we are placing this ban on such questions for the stated time to help ensure that r/AskReddit remains a welcoming environment for all.

We are not planning on shutting down r/AskReddit, as other subreddits have been doing, because we think that continuing to provide a forum for discussion is valuable.  We hope that the admins will be more forthcoming with information about the situation - we're currently as in the dark as everybody else is.

We do want to note that while we are not shutting down or removing mentions of Aimee Challenor, our normal rules **still apply and will be enforced**.  Posts or comments about the situation are allowed so long as they don't violate the rules, but using the situation as an excuse to farm karma, spew transphobic rhetoric, or doxx people will not be tolerated and will result in removals and bans, as always.  Our normal rules also apply to posts that are not asking open-ended discussion questions.  We have removed several posts today because they were not questions, or were yes/no questions.  Please read over the rules before posting so as to ensure your post follows them.

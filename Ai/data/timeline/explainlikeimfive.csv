We have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:

[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)

[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)

We are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.

Additionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, ""...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored."" This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)

Thank you all for the kind words thus far. u/bossgalaga's friends and family certainly will appreciate them."

It's taught more as ""you have these different  shaped blocks, and they each have a firmly defined meaning and part of that meaning is what they can do to the other blocks. Therefore we know everything the blocks can do, or can at least theorize it"" and less ""the blocks can be held and put together in infinite ways and be applied to infinite things that have yet to be fully imagined or understood and we're still coming up with new blocks every now and then"".

I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”

I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding *how* it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. 

It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. 

And no, I’m not a climate change denier. I’m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.

**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. 

Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:

* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The ""little ice age"" was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.

* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**

* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. 

* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). 

* The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.

* The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. 

* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]

* A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. 

* We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today."

***Thank you*** to everyone who has come here with something to explain, ask, add, or correct. I feel like I've learned a lot about something I've always loved, but had trouble understanding because, hell, I ain't no physicist :)

Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.

I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right? Getting into semantics about what kind of relativity something falls under, while interesting and even auxiliary, is somewhat superfluous in trying to grasp the simpler details. Of course, input is appreciated, but don't go too far out of your own way if you don't need to!"

I have a few questions about this.
I was once told that it's because multiple vocals of this era were done live through a single mic (rather than overdubbed one at a time), and the layers of harmonies disturb the hair in such a way that it causes this quality. Is this the case? If it is, what exactly is the ""disturbance""? Are there other factors, such as the equipment used, the mix of the recording, added reverb, etc?

>Edward Witten, ""Physics and Geometry""

According to Eric Weinstein (who I know is a controversial figure, but let's leave that aside for now), this is the most beautiful and important paragraph written in the English language. You can watch him talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/vdW9XDBuxjU?t=3079) or take a deep dive into his [Wiki](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome).

Could someone (1) literally translate the paragraph so a layman can grasp the gist of it, switching the specific jargon **in bold** with simplified plain English translations? Just assume I have no formal education in math or physics, so feel free to edit the flow of the paragraph for clarity's sake. For example, something like:

>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a ~~pseudo-Riemannian manifold~~ ***flexible*** ***3-dimension space*** *M*, endowed with a ~~metric tensor~~ **composite list of contingent quantities** and governed by geometrical laws... etc.

Is it likely that this ""Hawking chimp"" has already existed, but since we don't put forth much effort educating (most) apes we just haven't noticed?

Why is it so inefficient about what it does/doesnt store?

Edit: Wow thanks to everybody who answered! Apparently we do store vitamins and minerals. I thought we didn't because i heard taking supplemental vitamins was a waste because our bodies just pissed out the extras.

I'm still salty about needing to drink water constantly though. I work in a microbiology lab and have a lot of PPE to deal with every time i leave and reenter the lab to drink. I can't even chug a gallon of water and be good for the day; it has to be gradual.

Edit 3: Gold! Thanks strangers! And it turns out our bodies store water as well. Just not how i thought. But my eye does twitch when i drink a boatload of water one day, pee most of it out, then next day my body is like ""heyo i want more water even though I got rid of most of it yesterday""."

A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint.

Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?

I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is ""no"" and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.

I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to ""lose customers"", but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a ""no BS"" policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end.

2.	Hotels schedule routine/preventative maintenance.
3.	Hotels have plumbers on call.
4.	Hotels still have plumbing problems. We need to be good citizens and be cognizant of what we put it the drain. This benefits not only hotel owners but also staff and other guests.

i’ve had tinnitus literally my whole life. been checked out by ENT docs & had an MRI done as a kid. nothing showed up so they assumed i had been exposed to loud noises as a baby but my parent have no idea. i’ve been looking for remedies for years & just recently accepted my fate of lifelong ringing. its horribly disheartening, but it is what it is i guess.

looking for cures made me wonder though, what actually IS the ringing?? is it blood passing through your ear canal? literally just phantom noise my brain is making up? if i fixate on it i can make it extremely loud, to the point it feels like a speaker is playing too loud & hurting my eardrums. can you actual suffer damages to your ear drums from hearing “loud” tinnitus?? 

thanks in advance, im sure some of you will relate or can help me understand better what’s going on in my ears for the rest of my life. lol"

I also heard that the Guatemalan Quetzal was pegged to the dollar in the 20th century, but isn't any more.

How does this work? Does this mean that Belize Dollars are functionally US dollars in the global economy? And there must be implications for how much money a pegged country could print without losing its value...I could use an ELI5 overview!"

* Friend owes you $20? Here's my account number, send me the money. 
* Ecommerce vendor charges extra for card payment? Send money to their account number. 
* Pay rent? Here's the bank number.

However, in the US people treat their bank account numbers like social security, they will violently oppose sharing them. In internet banking the account number is starred out and only the last two/four digits are shown. Instead there are these weird ""pay bills"", ""move money"", ""zelle"", tabs, that usually require a phone number of the recipient, or an email. But that is still one additional layer of complexity deeper than necessary. 

Why is revealing your account number considered a security risk in the US?"

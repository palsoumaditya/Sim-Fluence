\~   \~   \~

Good morning!

I'm willing to bet that most of you won't remember my novel's origin prompt, though you might recognize me from stories such as [the one where a man must face four judges in the afterlife.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/bj3c3e/wp_when_you_die_you_wait_in_purgatory_until_you/) After all, it was over four years ago!

This was the prompt, if you want to take a look and see how poorly I wrote back then ;)

>[”You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/43mjo9/wp_you_possess_the_ability_of_persistent_lucid/)

It went from a terrible five part miniseries, to a Wattpad hopeful, to nothing as I lost motivation and drowned in work through the years, until finally I straightened myself out and rewrote the whole manuscript starting last year.

And now, somehow, here we are.

I'm both humbled and proud to present *Lost in a Dream*, a novel that actually adheres pretty closely to the prompt even after all of the rewriting and deep edits. Here is the blurb from the rear cover:

>**If dreaming is a drug, then I'm a junkie.**  
>  
>For most people, sleeping is an obstacle. Something to get out of the way, so they can get back to their life. For others, it's an escape to nothing; a blissful break from the wears of life.  
>  
>It's the opposite for me.  
>  
>I live so that I can dream. I trudge through work so that I can go home and close my eyes, awakening in the real world—one where dreams do come true. A place where I can fight a dragon instead of my ever-disappointed boss, where I’m a warrior instead of a glorified telemarketer. A place where I matter.  
>  
>Tigers instead of taxes. Monsters instead of men with too much power.  
>  
>Reality is just the word we came up with to accept a mundane life. A birthing place for grander ideas we so desperately wish could come true.  
>  
>I choose to live in a world where they do.

I’ll also share a few quick bits about the book:

*Lost in a Dream* is a lovechild of literary fiction and fantasy; it's likely considered portal fantasy, but leans more toward the literary side thematically.

* The cover art was done by Flor Figueroa over at Fiverr - look into her work if you want awesome minimalist cover art!
* The novel is a shred under 74,000 words, so it's not a book you can club people with. Sorry.
* It is a standalone novel--there won't be a sequel. I do, however, already have my next books planned.
* *Lost in a Dream* is my first published work!

Here's a snippet from the **advanced praise** for *Lost in a Dream:*

You are a world of your own.

That’s not to say you’re extraordinary, necessarily—you might be. Chances are you’re more so than me, at the least, but that’s not much of a feat. Rather, we are each little universes of thought, infinite in expanse yet bound by flesh; pioneers lost in our own minds. Every human is a wellspring of possibility and impossibility, every breath a wish for something greater as we run desperate from the impending dark.

We are, in a sense, prisoners to ourselves. Slaves to dreams we may well never grab hold of, working to the bone so that one day the schism between what we want and what we have might narrow ever so slightly. It is no surprise that every night we shut down for a brief reprieve, where we get a taste of the strange workings inside our heads. A glimpse into the potential we each have, raw as it may be.

When we aren’t asleep, exploring our own dreams, we look to those of others. Snippets of what it’s like to live in someone else’s mind; pretty portals to vast, new, and often beautiful worlds, or ones so terrible and forlorn that anything seems tolerable when compared. Something—anything—to distract from the one that we’re in. To feel greater than ourselves.

After all . . . isn’t that why you’re here?

# ~ ~ ~

*Is it greed to desire something grand?*

I often asked myself things like that as I killed someone.

Many lives have been forever reduced to similar questions that fade in and out like fireflies on a dark summer night—what’s ironic is that putting a sword through a neck is so much easier than finding the answers. It shouldn’t be, right? Just reach out and grab one of the little lightbugs and put it in a jar to study later . . . but every time I try, they vanish. All I get is a fistful of darkness.

By the time I was done thinking about all of that, there was only one other person breathing in the field before me: the man who had killed my family. My friends. My clansmen. I’d have cried looking at him if that well hadn’t dried up so long before; screamed if there were any leftover rage to burn.

""You're strong, Kinghunter,"" Ilhor Drago snarled, a hulking man in shimmering ebony armor patterned with wispy typhoons of cream and oxblood. He must’ve stood seven feet tall. ""But this is my home, and I'll not die here like some flame you'd snuff out with a shovel of dirt.""

He peered at me through two clusters of holes in a solid iron headpiece, describable only as a perforated bucket. The rest of his battalion littered the wood-lined meadow like smashed tin cans. They'd made quite a morbid medium for my art, shades of death tainting the lush, fertile forest around us, painting fern and flower slick with a contrasting crimson. In the holy glow of spring's sun, amidst a field paint-brushed with trampled fuchsia tulips and peonies that dribbled out of the treeline, the bloodied plants almost looked at home.

Ilhor charged at me, and I backpedaled toward the lake's muddy shore while keeping my sword raised overhead. Ilhor would be a challenge, no doubt—perhaps even worth three whole questions—but challenges are meant to be overcome, even if that challenge was once the most feared knight in any kingdom. A man known for cleaving children in two might terrify most, but I’d have fought God himself if that’s what it would’ve taken to put an end to Hadrian’s reign.

*What will I do when all of this is over?*

His footwork was perfectly placed with excellent tempo; he had the speed of a fox despite swelling with brutish strength, bowing the boundaries of human limits as if they physically couldn't contain his mass. Each swing of his enormous weapon left my own feeling heavier and heavier in hand, every metallic crack a seismic spasm that rang my soul like a church bell. I ducked and weaved through his razing, slowly backstepping to dodge; parrying had become too taxing on my aching palms. With each lurch forward, he churned huge piles of mud, flinging it around us. Though he was slowed, the length of his broadsword kept me from making a clean retreat.

*Is there a place left in the world for someone like me?*

Not only was I reduced to defense, but the stout cascade of steel he donned had virtually no openings, aside from under the armpits and a small gap beneath his helmet—one just big enough to slip a thin, thirsty blade into.

Another swing, another step, retreating further and further until I could avoid parrying no more and our swords locked with spark and screech. He grabbed me with a single hand that touched its fingers together at the nape of my neck, feet desperately reaching for the ground as he lifted me into the air. I must've looked to pedal myself airborne.

*Why am I so damn good at this?*

“Why did you come here?” Ilhor asked, though he didn’t care to relax his grip. “I defected. I defected!”

My words barely squeezed out between his fingers. “Hadrian wouldn’t let a defector live. Did you think an early retirement would save you?”

“How did you even find this place? He promised me it was safe!”

“Nowhere—” I punched at his giant gauntlets like a child, gasping. “—is safe.”

He grunted twice; once at me, and once at the ground.

With our weight combined, he sank past his ankles into the soft, dense mud that lined the lake's western shore. He dropped me, hoping it wasn’t too late, then yanked at them fruitlessly—an alligator has strength on the close, not open.

I lunged, but his sword slammed into mine and sent it flying further into the forest than reality should allow, nesting into the canopy with a grating *buzz* like a silver beetle. A pained screech and flurry of wings rang out, followed by a distant, wooden *thunk*. Before I could look back in disdain, his blade was thrusting straight at my heart. I ducked, twisting, and barely managed to get low enough for it to deflect off my mail, then grabbed his wrists and pushed forward with all my weight to outstretch his arms.

I only had a second before he'd overwhelm me, but that was all I needed. A small dagger, its polished gold hilt adorned with rubies, was partially hidden at his hip under a small flap of fraying linen. I let go of his off-hand, dropped even lower and grabbed it, then released his sword hand and pushed forward. In a blur of motion, I jammed the dagger into the thin gap between his helmet and breastplate just as his massive python of a left arm snapped at me again. A weary stumble backward was enough to escape his reach.

He struggled and sucked at the air, his words wet with blood. “I’m . . . not even . . . a king. . . .”

“How many innocent people did you kill for one?” I whispered, hacking off his head.

*That was for you, Ophelia. For our little ones.*

He plummeted into the coast, sinking into it a little bit. After a moment to collect myself, taking a few deep breaths, I was free to finally loot his body—a vulture hungry for the treasure I could smell on him. Out of a covered compartment at his right hip, I pulled out a golden scroll with reverence, cupping it in my hands and brushing my thumbs across its complex network of embossed vines. It was the fifth one I'd stolen, and it was every bit as mesmerizing as the first, glowing as though the sun itself had been laid out in my still aching palms. I knelt there for some time, drinking its glow, and aches melted to memory with each moment. Eventually, I found it within myself to forfeit worship and tuck it into a satchel at my waist.

My fugitive beetle-sword was stuck in a tree nearly twenty yards away, with traces of blood on and around it. Splintered branches and shredded leaves littered the area, but there were no signs of life—or death—anywhere. I yanked it out, apologized to anything I may have harmed in Dominaria Forest, and ran back to the lake's edge.

*Hidden. No patrols, no shipments, no trade. Forest for miles on all sides. How ironic that your pet’s hiding place has become mine, Hadrian. It'll need a little cleanup, to say the least, but maybe this can be somewhere my roots can anchor.*

*A place to belong.*

As I approached the castle, stepping over bodies like they were nothing more than fallen branches after a storm, a light, playful voice caught me off-guard.

""What a shame—I wanted to kill him.""

I spun, reflexively unsheathing my sword to flare wary steel. A woman emerged from behind bark, crossing her arms and leaning lazily against the tree she'd been using for cover. Her weapon was unattended, dangling with a laxness inherited from its owner.

""I was rooting for you to lose, but your fighting skills are impressive. You're not like the others I’ve run into around here,"" she continued, her gaze sharper than a blade fresh off of whetstone, her lips hinting at a smirk.

I smiled as a cool breeze slid through thick trees, relaxing. ""Yeah. You seem . . . different, somehow. You seem real."""

A few things: 

1. Found the prompt on Pinterest, thought it was interesting (not necessarily realistic), and decided to post it, fully expecting it to go unnoticed. Surprise! 

2. I am not in any way trying to take credit for coming up with the idea. 

3. Turns out this is a repost. 🤷 Who knew?! /u/WinsomeJesse did because they posted it last time. Not trying to steal anyone's thunder. If you're super perturbed about it, go show them some love. 

4. Have a good day y'all; be kind, make good decisions, and don't hold in your farts. 😉✌️"

Two years ago, I started writing short stories here on /r/WritingPrompts. And the fourth prompt that I ever responded to was: [The Roman Empire never collapsed and the year is 1999 AD](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2kx5e9/wp_the_roman_empire_never_collapsed_and_the_year/). I enjoyed writing it so much that I soon followed it up with a Part II. Then I just kept writing and writing until it turned into a 90,000 word novel: Rex Electi! [The book is available on Amazon here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N03B1AJ) and, if you have a different e-reader, there are PDF and ePub versions [available here](https://gumroad.com/l/htCH). It's $2.99 through both sites.

Here's the blurb:

> Caius Serica, a pilot in the Roman military in the year 1999, is whisked away from his camp in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances. He soon learns that every aspect of his life so far, including the staged deaths of his parents, has been arranged by the Senate Tribunal in an attempt to mold him into the perfect leader. Now there are only thirty candidates, including Caius, left competing to be the Emperor's heir. Success in a series of trials will reunite him with his family and make him the most powerful man in the world, but failure will lead to a life of isolation and imprisonment. As Caius enters the trials, it becomes apparent that the tests themselves are not the problem: it is the twenty nine other candidates willing to do whatever it takes to win, including maim or kill their top competitors. Can Caius navigate the pitfalls of imperial politics and cutthroat competition, all while performing well enough to succeed in the trials fair and square?

I'm also *thrilled* to have a physical copy of it! [Just look at how awesome this is!](http://imgur.com/a/wGUBX) I am so pleased to be able to have a copy to put up on my bookshelf (well, actually I am going to frame mine but you probably wouldn't do that). If you would also like a physical copy, you can [get a copy here through Createspace](https://www.createspace.com/6709876)! Physical copies are $8.89, but well worth it!

I just want to thank everyone in the /r/WritingPrompts community. This is my first novel (I also have an ebook collection [available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Luna_Lovewell/comments/3jhk4n/i_published_an_ebook_its_called_prompt_me_you/) but that doesn't really count), and it just feels like I am finally taking a step that I have *always* wanted to take. Posting here has honestly changed my life, and I owe that to all of you readers. And more specifically, thank you to everyone who subscribes to /r/Luna_Lovewell for all of your support and encouragement. 

So that's all! I really hope you'll pick up a copy of the book and give it a read!

[Kindle copies available for only $2.99](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Child-Places-Leonard-Petracci-ebook/dp/B076PGG2XK), which can be read on phone, computer, or tablets!  

**Here is chapter 1, which was the original response that spurred everything forwards**

It was an accident, of course.

My birth, my being in space, and well, I suppose I was an accident as well. An accident from the director of engineering screwing the fat janitor after hours when the rest of the shuttle team had retired; the odds that my mother had been able to hide her baby bump for nine months, the chances that she had been a nurse before being selected from the program and knew how to give birth herself, in a maintenance closet, mere days before the mission was to return to earth. Keeping me hidden was difficult in the small confines of the ship, but the other hundred and fifty crew members had been too busy to pay a mere maid much attention. After all, many insisted that it had not been worthwhile to bring her along, that a maid had been a waste of tax dollars. I suppose that makes me a waste of tax dollars as well.

But there were those that spoke to her unique abilities as a maid. For she had been born deep in the snow of the north, during the first blizzard of winter, that like the first snowfall, she could smooth over any differences in her environment and make it appear uniform. As a maid, it meant that she had an extraordinary sense of cleanliness. As a mother, it meant she could ensure I was overlooked, that my crying was muffled, and later in life, that I appeared no different from anyone else.

Star Child, she had called me as she smuggled me back into the atmosphere, tucked deep in her suit like a kangaroo would carry her young. Star Child, she whispered to me when the project disbanded, and she took me to the inner city apartment where I spent my early life. Star Child, she reprimanded whenever I started pushing and pulling at the equilibrium of our apartment, when she would arrive home from work and all the furniture would be clustered at the center of the room, pulled together by a force point.

“When will I go to school?” I asked her when I was eight, watching the uniformed children marching up the street through the wrought-iron gates of the academy, one of them flicking flames across his fingers like a coin while another left footprints of frost in the grass.

“You already go to school, Star Child,” she said. “And your teachers say you've been learning your numbers well, and your reading has been progressing.”

“Not *that* school,” I had said, pulling a face. “I want to go to the academy. The special school, for the others like me!” I held up a fist, and items on the desk in front of me flew towards it, pens and papers and pencils that stuck out like quivering quills out of my skin.

“Star Child, listen and stop that at once,” she said, her eyes level with mine. “There *are* no others like you. Those children; they are all classified, they are all known. You are *not* like them, you never will be. And they can't know, do you understand me?”

“I guess,” I answered with a huff, watching as one of the children cracked a joke and the others laughed. “But I don't like my school. Everyone there knows we can't be like them, that we can't be special.”

“Star Child, you *are* special. One day, they'll know that too. But not now – if they knew, they wouldn't take you to the academy. They'd take you somewhere else, somewhere terrible.”

And as I grew older, I realized that she was right. That when our neighbor started developing powers, a police squad showed up at her front door and classified her on the spot. That they left her with a tattoo on her shoulder, a tattoo of a lightning bolt, symbolizing the storm during which she had been born. Just like the tattoo of a snowflake on my mother's shoulder, colored dull grey, to indicate a low threat potential.

So instead of going to the academy, I created an academy of my own, in my room. Mother made me turn the lights out at ten, so during the day, I collected light outside, keeping it in one of the dark holes I could create when I closed my fist hard enough, and letting it loose at night to read books I had stolen from the library. From the section for the special children, that I could only access if the librarians were distracted.

But distractions came easy to me.

As I grew older, the city streets became more populated with the blue uniforms of police. The academy became increasingly harder to attend, and the gifted girl next door disappeared one night without a note. Mother stopped letting me outside after dark, and the lines for the soup kitchens grew longer. The skies grew darker, the voices accustomed to speaking in whispers, and the television news seemingly had less and less to report. It was as if there was a blanket thrown upon us, but no one dared look to see who had thrown it.

But I would. And when I did, I realized the earth needed a Star Child.

Leslie felt tired. He assumed he was supposed to, since this was the way he (and everyone else in his class) had always felt. As he awaited his turn to be called to the front of the stadium—to be branded with a new job, new housing arrangement, possibly a new spouse and pet dog named Sophie—he wondered what his new life would look like. Would he grow old as a construction worker, perhaps? Or an office manager, whatever vague responsibilities that entailed? Maybe a simple cashier at a grocery store, because in spite of new technologies, people still had to eat, and robots were no good at helping the elderly pack their vehicles with groceries.

A quiet groan escaped him. He felt even more tired now. He entertained an unexpected thought: *Is this all my life is now? Is this all I can look forward to? A job?*

His name was called. Not his real name of Leslie Farringer Hill—a confluence of his father Leslie’s name as well as that of his great grandfather Farringer—but his Assigned Name of 2099356. Leslie climbed onto a stage in the middle of an arena, where a line of stoic elders grasped their wrists and stared at him with grim indifference. Leslie sat beside dozens of civilians like himself, who sat before the Automated Work Reassignment bot, waiting for their assignments.

Leslie placed his forehead against wide screen and allowed the machine to dig a thin needle into his cerebral cortex. The pain was minimal, surprisingly—like the pinch you get when you pierce your ears. When it was done, Leslie and his classmates left the stage, and the elders announced, “Next!”

No applause. No congratulations. Just “Next.”

Leslie’s grandfather said that Reassignment used to be exciting. People were given the option—key word, “option”—to change jobs if they were unhappy, medically disabled, or better suited to another field. A good many of them got to choose their own jobs—a foreign concept to Leslie’s class of 2118. But then, the option to “choose” meant that jobs were in abundance, which had not been the case in half a century.

When the first version of the Primary Automation Network—or PAN—was released, there was high demand for workers needing to maintain the program’s vast webbing of databases, neural connections and information flow. Then the tech got smarter, and work done by human hands became outdated; PAN began functioning on its own, running its own updates and anticipating its own needs.

The human population, however, continued to rise, while jobs declined. Nowadays, you got what you got. You didn’t argue or complain. If you did, you’d starve—and they’d let you.

“Hey, Les, what’d they stick you with?” Travis Dollman asked. Leslie noticed the shifting of his eyes back and forth as he gazed into his Internal Personalized Interface, which accessed the ever-growing layers of PAN.

“Don’t know yet,” Leslie replied. He wasn’t in a hurry to find out, either; he would have to live with his fate for the rest of his life. “How about you?”

“Reading the job description right now,” Travis said. He sounded distant, lost in the world of PAN. “Looks like… Oh, hey! Not bad! Chief Agriculture Overseer for the… Ah, shit, in the Swamps. Oh well, it’s good pay. Wife Meredith, Doberman Pixie, son named Liam. And triple supply of rations on a private acre. Not bad.”

Travis blinked, tuning out of his IPI. “Aren’t you gonna look at yours?”

Leslie shrugged. “Later. I’m tired. Had to do a double-shift last night, didn’t sleep much. I think I’ll go crash at the apartment.”

“Well, at least look and see if you still *have* an apartment first.” He grinned slyly, like he was telling a good joke that Leslie would never get. “Who knows? Maybe you landed a gig with Infinitum. They get crazy-good benefits.”

Leslie returned a shy smile. “Doubt it, but… Maybe you’re right.”

Leslie pulled up his IPI and dove into PAN’s universe. His system calibrated updates in seconds, a nice blinking clock telling him that it was 59 percent complete… 73 percent… 95 percent…

When it finished, a welcome letter greeted him. It read:

Congratulations on your Reassignment, 2099356! You have been reassigned to occupation:

SERIAL KILLER

That didn’t sound right. It sounded like… well, not anything that Leslie had heard of, actually. The only thing familiar to him was the word “kill,” which was spoken when something electronic sparked in his office and the Electrical Technicians had to “kill” the connection. He supposed it could also pertain to when the elderly had reached their time of Passage, when they grew too old to perform their jobs appropriately and were euthanized; it was sometimes morbidly referred to as the “time of killing,” a phrase Leslie and the general population repulsed.

But “serial killer” was something new to him. Below his title, an icon of a file folder blinked deep red at him, indicating the position was high level and top secret. Which meant upper echelon access into the depths of PAN, which very few civilians knew about, let alone explored.

Below that was a list of his benefits package: Fully-furnished housing on a five-acre plot (an ungodly amount of living space in today’s economy), wife Blaise Parkham, a gray Persian named Mufasa, and five times the normal ration supply delivered weekly to his doorstep.

*Holy shit,* Leslie thought. He blinked and closed his IPI.

“Well?” Travis asked impatiently.

“Uh… Something in agriculture, too.”

Travis squinted at him. *“Something in agriculture?* What the hell does that mean?”

“Yeah, I dunno. It’s a lot to read and I’m too tired. I’ll, uh… talk to you about it later. Need to rest.”

Leslie nearly ran out of the building. He felt Travis’s suspicious gaze on him, but he brushed it off. He felt uneasy, his adrenaline pumping faster than he was used to. If he was going to live in high-class, he needed to figure out what his job entailed, and he couldn’t concentrate with Travis’s never-ending monologue in his ear.

Leslie walked down the street, passing beneath the mousetraps of tram cars that ran noisily all day and night. Directly outside of Town Hall, a line of Individually Automated Vehicles awaited their passengers. He’d never had a car—had only set foot in one once, in fact. He had always relied on his feet for transportation. The 120-degree heat and omnipresent cloud of smoke lingering in the air had ceased to bother him.

About halfway home, a sleek charcoal vehicle stopped beside him. A door popped open and a charming female voice spoke: “Passenger 2099356, you may now enter your vehicle.”

*Mine? No way. Not mine.*

A few seconds later, the voice beckoned him again: “Passenger 2099356, please enter your vehicle and select your destination.”

Leslie warily stepped into the car. On the dashboard was a map of Ponderosa Pines, with a blue circle in the top left corner that read, “Home.” Leslie selected it, and 45 minutes later arrived at a large residence on Old Bakery Avenue. It was surrounded by a stone fence. The car approached a broad metal gate. The gate’s sensor connected to the car’s dashboard and asked for Leslie’s fingerprints. Leslie placed a hand on the screen, his identity was verified, and the gate opened.

Inside the fence, pine trees rose to staggering heights, dropping streams of needles and cones as the wind tossed them about. Beyond the trees was a stone mansion, painted white with black highlights around the windows and door frames. Two cars were parked out front—one for him and one for Blaise, he presumed.

He exited the car and entered into a wide-open living room, freshly painted and sparsely furnished. A chandelier hung above a staircase that led to the second and third floors.

In the far room at the other end of the house, a 90-inch television blasted music videos. Leslie could see the back of a woman’s black-haired head.

“2099356, I presume?” the black-haired head asked without turning around.

“Call me Leslie.”

“Call me Blaise. Or 2105344, I don’t give a shit.”

Lovely.

Leslie climbed the stairs and found a bedroom with a double-king bed, which he presumed he was supposed to share with Blaise. Upon it, a royal gray Persian named Mufasa yawned at him, his red collar jingling as the cat shook his head.

Leslie climbed into bed and refreshed his IPI. The number of databases he could access in PAN as a Mini Mart clerk—his first job—numbered in the low 100s. As a serial killer, they numbered at 989, 341, 863—and the numbers rose every few milliseconds.

Leslie frantically searched for anything related to “serial killer,” and began queuing thousands of historical documents and videos and biographical entries to download simultaneously. An alert rose on his IPI stating that his downloading power was insufficient for such high-speed traffic—would he like to upgrade to the latest version 13.4.57?

*Latest version?* he thought. *I never imagined upgrading to anything higher than a 3.0.1, let alone the* latest version *of IPI software.*

He agreed to the Terms of Use and—without suffering penalties to his weekly rations, to his surprise—the latest update of IPI was downloaded.

And with it, seconds later, gigabytes of information about serial killers from the infinite PAN.

Gigabytes of blood, torture, dismemberment and murder. Videos that immortalized the terror of the victims as well as the ecstasy on the faces of the voyeurs who slayed them.

Gigabytes of autopsy reports from the 21st century detailing the gunshot wounds, burns, incisions, and dismemberments of millions of victims—and the biographical recounting of the sadistic rituals the preceded them.

Gigabytes of accounts detailing how to stalk a victim before the kill; how to kill and dispose of a body; the best tools to make it quick, or make it slow…

Leslie’s vision turned white as the information was pummeled into his IPI. He blinked hard to log out of it. Then he turned over the side of his bed and vomited all over the hardwood floor. He vomited four more times until his body ached and vibrated.

His IPI popped up unexpectedly—which shouldn’t have happened. There were built-in codes which disallowed the software to act without permission from the host. But, Leslie thought, maybe it was just a feature that came with the high-profile job. A new message alerted him:

Greetings, 2099356! Your first assignment is:

LYLE MCCATHERN

Location:

1573 E. FAUBREY LANE

Time to Complete:

26 HOURS

*Shit, what does that mean?* Leslie thought.

“What do you think it means, numb nuts?” he argued aloud with himself. “It means you have to kill him.”

“Kill what?” Blaise asked, standing in the doorway. Leslie startled at her appearance.

“Oh my *god,*” Blaise exclaimed, noticing the pile of vomit. “Are you sick?”

Leslie hurriedly covered the vomit with the bedsheets. “Uh, no… Don’t worry about it. I’ll clean it up.”

“You said you need to kill something,” Blaise said. “Is there an electrical problem? Do we need an Electrical Technician, or something?”

“No, no. I’ll handle that, too, don’t worry.”

An awkward silence hung in the air. Then, another message appeared in the IPI:

Instrument of Choice:

HATCHET

Leslie’s heart plummeted into his guts. He nearly puked a seventh time. He choked it back, swallowing painfully.

Blaise sat on the other side of the bed. “So… I guess we’re married now. You wanna… I dunno, go on a date, or something?”

LYLE MCCATHERN. 1573 E. FAUBREY LANE. 26 HOURS. HATCHET.

*Jesus Christ.*

“Did you hear me?” Blaise demanded.

“Yeah, a date. Sure. Tomorrow. I have some work to do.”

Blaise scoffed. “Already? Jeez, you just started, like, an hour ago.”

Leslie nodded uncertainly. “Lots to do, I guess.”

\*\*\*

His first kill was awful. And messy—*really* messy. Why a hatchet was chosen for him, he didn’t know. But he sensed that, somewhere beyond the IPI, PAN itself was watching him. He’d been in the workforce long enough to realize that if you didn’t fulfill your job requirements— all T’s crossed and I’s dotted—you wouldn’t be granted leeway or forgiveness. Your rations, valuable as they were, would be first to suffer.

After that, shit would keep rolling downhill.

Leslie accessed his PAN downloads on disposing a body and then how to extract evidence from a crime scene. He had to vomit multiple times into the garbage bags he used to mop up Lyle McCathern’s remains. He finished at the 23-hour mark, and PAN was satisfied.

A new message appeared, with an icon of a cake with flaming candles beneath it:

Congratulations on completing your first assignment, 2099356!

Next assignment to be uploaded in:

56.6334 HOURS

As the slaughtered remains of Lyle McCathern—just some Joe Schmo who worked at a brewery, it seemed—incinerated in a pit beside him, Leslie cupped his hands over his face and sobbed.

He sobbed. And retched. And sobbed some more.

Then he went home and stayed in bed until his next assignment.

\*\*\*

He went on dates with Blaise. They exchanged half-hearted conversation. He stroked the fur along Mufasa’s spine, making the cat purr contentedly. He sat in front of the television with his new family and watched movies to which he couldn’t pay attention.

Because the information lurking in his mind was as alluring as it was insidious. Leslie didn’t appreciate the allure, but he acknowledged it was there. He found himself accessing crevices of PAN that housed information he would have never considered. Some of the terms he came across—murder, crime, torture—had been deleted from public access decades after PAN was invented, Leslie discovered. With centralized control of PAN solely in the hands of one corporation, Infinitum, coupled with the mandatory law that IPI’s be implanted at birth, it was easy for them to conceal and reveal whatever information they wanted.

And now Leslie had unrestricted access to it.

At the 56.6334-hour mark, Leslie received a new message on his IPI. He uttered a worried half-groan before the software consumed him:

Good afternoon, 2099356!

Your next assignment is:

JAMES AND JILL HAWTHORNE

Location:

MILDRED’S COFFEE HOUSE

Instrument of Choice:

GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED

Time to Complete:

2 HOURS

Leslie searched for Mildred’s Coffee House on his IPI map. It was nearly an hour away by car. And he had no idea where he would have the time to find a Glock 43, whatever that was, and kill two people—*two* of them. In a public place.

“Fuck,” he whispered.

“What’s wrong?” Blaise asked, not looking away from the television.

“Work again.”

“Do you know when you’ll be back?”

Leslie sighed. “Soon, probably.”

The car door opened automatically for him. It received notifications when Leslie received missions. It sped down the highway at top speed, as if it understood his time constraints.

Then, a hidden compartment opened beside the map screen. Leslie reached in and extracted a couple of things. First, a handgun—the Glock 43 with a silencer, he guessed. He’d never held a gun before, so he sifted through dozens of links on gun handling before reaching the coffee shop.

The other items included a denim jacket, a fake goatee, sunglasses, and a baseball cap representing a team he didn’t recognize.

*PAN is teaching me how to be a serial killer,* Leslie thought. He applied the accessories. He was grateful for the gesture, but didn’t expect PAN’s courtesy to last long; the automaton had never done him favors like this before. No sense in expecting the generosity to guide him through the rest of his life.

Mildred’s was packed with people. Leslie had no idea coffee was such a hot commodity at one o’ clock in the afternoon. The line dumped out of the front door and onto the surrounding sidewalk. Leslie took his place in line behind a fat couple and a yipey Yorkie with which they rubbed noses. *“You’re such a good boy,”* they coddled. *“Oh, what a good, good boy.”*

Leslie scanned through PAN to find out what James and Jill Hawthorne looked like: He, a pretty-boy millionaire-looking barbie in real estate with slick gray hair and an attractive layer of stubble; she, also a slick-haired real estate agent enticing enough to be in modeling or porn—whichever PAN deemed most productive, Leslie scoffed.

Music blasted inside. People between the ages of 25 and 35 dominated the dining hall. Leslie glanced around, and spotted the couple in the corner. They looked sulky, certainly the least lively of the crowd, as if they’d just had a fight.

Jesus, there were a lot of people. How could PAN expect Leslie to fulfill his job with three dozen witnesses surrounding him? He felt sweat seep from every pore on his body. His IPI announced that he had 35 minutes and 14 seconds remaining… 13 seconds… 12…

“Fuck,” he mumbled. *“Fuck.”*

In a panic, he nearly retreated to his IPI for guidance.

But then it hit him. That word: Panic.

“How can I help you?” a bored, acne-infested barista inquired.

“Um… Three black coffees, please,” Leslie replied. He paid for the drinks, then carried them over to a low table surrounded by beanbags on which the still-sulking Hawthorne couple resided.

Leslie took a deep breath. *Here goes.*

“Hey, friends!” his voice boomed. They looked at him with suspicion and confusion.

“Remember me? It’s Marty! Your old pal!”

Jill looked at James, and he returned her concerned glare. “I don’t—” Jill began to say.

Leslie interrupted her. “Come on, you remember me! From college! We took the same algebra class!”

“I didn’t—”

Leslie cut her off again. “Here. Black coffee, just the way you like it. On the house. Come on, let’s get a picture together, what do you say?”

Impatiently, he gestured for them to merge together on one chair. “Come on, squeeze together, don’t be shy. You’re married, for crying out loud! You’ve seen each other *naked!”*

The Hawthornes laughed nervously. Leslie felt as nervous as they sounded.

He retrieved a phone from his pocket and loaded the camera app. “Alright, now, smile and say cheese!”

They did. Just before Leslie dialed the “Take Photo” button, he uncovered the Glock from behind his denim jacket. Jill Hawthorne noticed it. Leslie pulled the trigger twice—a quick “one, two.” Jill’s surprise turned to terror, then to realization that she’d been shot and was seconds from death. James died without knowing he’d been shot.

The camera snapped a picture.

Leslie stuffed the gun back in his coat and sprang to his feet. *“HO!”* he screamed, waving his limbs wildly. *“Holy SHIT! Sweet mother of CHRIST! SOMEBODY HELP!”*

Curious eyes moved to the dead bodies.

Then: Panic.

Beautiful.

Leslie allowed himself to be swallowed by the frantic herd as people stormed to the front door and created a bottleneck. He was nearly crushed by the fat couple with their hideous Yorkie as they struggled to push through the doorway. Finally, he separated from the crowd and sprinted to his car. He selected “Destination: Home.” It took him nearly fifteen minutes to catch his breath, and another ten to slow his heart rate. He followed the procedures on shirking the evidence, then returned home.

“You’re right,” Blaise said, still sitting in the same place on the couch as when Leslie had left. “That was quick.”

“Yeah,” Leslie said, feeling breathless. “Easy day.”

He retreated to the king bed, where he expected once again to vomit and sob. But he didn’t. In fact, he felt… good. Really good, actually. His IPI congratulated him once again, this time promising to deliver a tray of expensive cakes and sweets to his door within 24 hours.

Cakes aside, he felt lifted, as if the adrenaline boost had filled him with helium. He liked this airy feeling.

And something else: He didn’t feel remorse, as he had after bludgeoning Lyle McCathern. The bullets were quick and not nearly as messy as the damned hatchet. He could get used to bullets. It felt less personal. More like a job.

And that’s exactly what it was.

\*\*\*

Leslie killed half a dozen more people in the subsequent month. A sleezy waitress in Nevada; a hokey bartender running for mayor in California; two airline attendants from an Asian country he didn’t recognize (just some dull, primitive society that had outlawed PAN, as Leslie understood it).

His murders became famous on the news, though the media gave him the piss-poor, unimaginative name of the Ponderosa Pines Executioner. With millions of databases he could download in seconds, Leslie learned from the mistakes of the idiots of the past centuries. No evidence had been found to incriminate him. Fortunately for him, the criminal justice system had been gutted to the point of near obsolescence in the last 100 years. Thanks to the strong-armed, omniscient PAN, people knew what stepping out of the parameters set forth by PAN meant. They knew that a crime against PAN, no matter how small, would risk their lives.

What they didn’t know—but Leslie now did—was that a crime against PAN meant a violent, prolonged, agonizing death. PAN ensured that jobs of such a specialty were still around—and well-compensated.

Not only had Leslie gotten better at killing—when he wasn’t actually doing it, he was shuffling through thousands of digital archives learning about it—but he thought he’d gotten better about *not caring* about it. That is, until he had to kill two teenage parents of a four-year-old.

Leslie hadn’t noticed the kid standing in the hallway, watching as Leslie duct-taped his parents’ mouths shut, strapped them to chairs and started drilling holes in them (the instrument of choice was an electric drill). He hadn’t noticed the kid until he’d burrowed a drill bit deep into his mother’s skull and killed her.

“Ah, shit,” Leslie muttered.

The kid had just stood there, sucking his thumb, taking it all in. They stood in silence for a full minute. Then, Leslie left the kid alone in the house, got in the car, and went back home. Realizing the magnitude of what he’d done, he vomited for the first time since Lyle McCathern.

“Goddamn it,” he grumbled. He repeated it louder. *“Goddamn it.”*

He punched the dashboard. Then he did it again, and again, wailing on the thing. He started slamming his elbows and knees and feet around the car’s interior, screaming and cursing. He threw himself about until it hurt, and continued until he felt like one giant, throbbing ache.

Weakly, he picked up his phone to dial the police. A picture of the Hawthornes’ dead bodies, taken just seconds after Leslie shot them, flashed on the screen. Leslie’s lips trembled, and he broke out into hysterical sobbing. He threw his phone aside. He’d forgotten about that picture. His first instinct was to smash the damned thing, destroy all traces of evidence.

But Leslie couldn’t just ignore the kid. He’d already left him alone in that house, amidst the grotesque corpses of his parents. He’d hate himself forever if he just left the kid like that. He needed to call someone to that house to get the boy.

One of the things Leslie had repeatedly stumbled upon in the PAN archives was the remorselessness that seemed to be inherent in the most famous killers. Most of them felt no pity for the victims or their families, no regrets for their actions. In fact, a lot of them claimed they would do it again if they ever got out. They didn’t have to think about how *not* to feel bad.

Leslie wasn’t that lucky.

He dialed the police number and reported a break-in. Then he hung up the phone, and forgot about smashing it. He felt tired, more so than he’d felt at Reassignment last month. How he longed for a chance to change jobs, like his grandfather Farringer had done before him.

“I can’t keep doing this,” Leslie spoke out loud. “I’m not… I’m not a serial killer.”

He knew PAN could hear him, even when he wasn’t logged in to the IPI. Leslie expected the IPI to activate any moment to deliver a personal message from PAN saying Leslie was out of line. A reminder that “breach of a worker’s protocol with daily job-related task ensures penalties commensurate with the worker’s offense, with punishments to be fulfilled in accordance with PAN Law 00841.”

Yeah, Leslie had known it by heart since his early childhood school days. It meant that whole violent, prolonged, agonizing death thing.

But no message came. Surely PAN had heard him, but it didn’t have anything to say.

Leslie rolled over to cry some more.

\*\*\*

Leslie threw his phone down on the king bed. It landed next to Mufasa, who sniffed it considerately, then flinched away with disgust. Leslie barged into his bathroom and slammed the door shut. He felt overheated and sweaty. He turned the shower faucet to cold. He didn’t bother to remove his clothes. He stood beneath the water until cold tremors shook his body.

There was a knock at the bathroom door. “Are you okay?” Blaise shouted.

Leslie didn’t answer right away. Blaise asked him twice more, her tone of voice becoming more afraid each time.

“Fine,” Leslie mumbled. “I’m fine.”

A message arrived in his IPI:

Greetings, 2099356!

Your next assignment is:

BLAISE PARKHAM

Location:

1066 OLD BAKERY AVENUE

Instrument of Choice:

GLOCK 43 WITH SUPPRESSOR ATTACHED

Time to Complete:

3.43 MINUTES

No. No, something was wrong. A bug, a glitch. Something. It wasn’t right.

“What the *fuck?”* Blaise’s scream sent shivers along Leslie’s spine, as strong as the cold water shivers he felt now.

Leslie shut off the water and dashed out of the bathroom, water cascading off his sopping clothes. In the bedroom, Blaise stared incredulously into Leslie’s phone.

“What the fuck *is* this?”

She held out the phone, which brandished the image of the dead Hawthornes. Leslie’s heart pounded wildly, then sank into his bowels.

“Why were you looking through my phone?” he asked. His voice was steady in spite of his shivering.

Blaise snorted. “Really? That’s what you’re going to say? Tell me what the fuck this picture is doing on your fucking phone, Les.”

“I can’t.”

A bitter smile drew across Blaise’s lips. She shook her head slowly. “These pictures were on the news. Are you the Executioner?”

Leslie’s silence and downward gaze told Blaise all she needed to know.

“Jesus Christ…” she said.

The timer in Leslie’s IPI dipped below two minutes. The numbers pulsed in blood-red, in sync with his own heartbeat. PAN began listing the consequences of Leslie’s failure to complete the assignment.

Leslie held up his hands, both empty, for Blaise to see. “I’m going to get a towel. When I come out, let’s talk.”

He retreated into the bathroom. He picked up his gun. He returned to the bedroom and pointed the muzzle at Blaise’s chest.

Her eyes widened. “You can’t be serious.”

Leslie’s IPI counted down the seconds: 52… 51… 50…

“It’s your job now, isn’t it?” Blaise asked. “The Pines Executioner thing. It’s why our rations are so high. Why you keep disappearing, sometimes for days.”

40… 39… 38…

Leslie thought of the kid standing in the hallway, and Leslie standing beside the dead parents. It occurred to him that PAN knew everything, including what Leslie was doing right at that moment. It knew every detail about every killer before him. And it was adding Leslie, the first serial killer in 100 years, to its database. Leslie Farringer Hill, the Pines Executioner. He slaughtered a family and ruined a kid’s life… because he was Reassigned.

“No,” he whimpered, a line of tears running past his nose. He shook his head angrily. “*No.”*

19… 18… 17…

Leslie hurtled the gun against a far wall. “Get out of here,” he commanded.

Blaise didn’t hesitate. She dropped the phone and sprinted for the door, leaving Leslie as alone as he’d left the little boy.

The timer expired. The IPI deemed the assignment a failure. It commanded Leslie to stay in his place of residency, reminded him penalties would be issued in accordance with PAN Law 00841… So on and so forth.

Leslie stripped out of his clothes, lay naked on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. It was the last time he would set foot in a house like this.

He stroked Mufasa’s cheeks and chin, enjoying the hum of the cat’s purr.

\*\*\*

Days later, once the Law Enforcement Branch had caught up with PAN’s report on Leslie’s failure to provide adequate work output, they came for him. They broke into Leslie’s bedroom, stuffed his head in a black bag, and shoved his naked body into a car he couldn’t see.

He spent two weeks in a cold dungeon. The walls echoed with each breath he took—as well as every beating, stabbing, and burning his hoarse voice protested.

A week into the torture, a voice spoke to him. A woman’s voice, though it sounded deep like a man’s.

“What do you know about the Rebellion?” the voice asked.

“The what?”

A fist collided with Leslie’s solar plexus, knocking the air out of his lungs.

“Tell me what you know about the Rebellion,” the voice said.

Leslie struggled to catch his breath. “I don’t… I don’t know…”

“Search him to make sure,” the voice instructed.

The hands that had winded him grasped his head and held it still. A high-pitched whirring sound drew close to his head.

Then a sharp stabbing pain electrified every nerve in Leslie’s body as a thin metal wire was inserted into his cerebral cortex. Leslie screamed, but couldn’t tell if the high pitch was from the wire or his voice.

The pain lasted a long time. How long, Leslie couldn’t know; there was no sunlight to guide his sense of time in the dungeon. Eventually, it stopped, and Leslie was allowed a brief break.

“Anything?” the woman’s voice demanded.

A low, grunting man spoke. “Nothing.”

“How thorough was your search?”

Hesitation in the man’s voice. “Pretty thorough.”

“‘Pretty thorough’ does not mean thorough. Do it again.”

The whirring sound. The blinding pain.

And more screaming.

\*\*\*

The sessions went on for days. Leslie’s nerves throbbed and he could barely move.

The door to his dungeon squeaked open. Footsteps approached his quivering body. He tried to speak—“no, please, no more”—but his voice was too hoarse, his lungs too tired, his body too shaky.

“Come with me, Mr. Hill.” Leslie recognized the deep-toned woman’s voice.

Leslie didn’t move.

The woman sighed. “Get him up.”

Strong, rough hands lifted Leslie by the armpits and dragged him into a bright hallway. The light pierced his eyes and brain. He scrunched his eyes closed, providing mild relief.

Minutes later, when he could open his eyes, Leslie saw he was being led into a large courtroom. He sat before a panel of disinterested elderly people in black robes. Their table was raised several feet higher than Leslie’s chair.

A gaunt-faced woman with blonde hair sat in the center of the panel, peering down at Leslie’s naked figure. “State your name for the record.” Her voice was sharp.

Leslie tried to speak, but his throat burned. He swallowed a few times to soothe the sandpaper feeling, but still only managed to grunt a few painful syllables.

The woman rolled her eyes. “Your name, please.”

Between hacking coughs, Leslie managed: “L-Leslie… F-Farr-ring-ger… H-H-Hill.”

“Mr. Hill, you have been charged by the High Court of Infinitum and Our Majesty the Primary Automation Network with failure to produce adequate service to the Union as part of your daily job duties. The proper punishment for such an offense, in accordance with PAN Law, is death.”

Leslie didn’t respond. This wasn’t news to him. He’d expected to die days ago. He was baffled that he was still alive.

“However,” the blonde woman continued, “upon reviewing the information extracted from your IPI, it appears you are the victim of a glitch in PAN’s system. The glitch was detected just hours ago, and is believed to have been caused by a virus implanted by a faction group known as the Rebellion.”

Leslie shook his head. “I… I’ve never heard—”

“I know you’ve never heard of them, Mr. Hill,” the woman interrupted impatiently. “That’s what I’m trying to tell you. Your Reassignment to the position of ‘serial killer’—a position that is not a true occupation, but a primitive criminal activity banned by PAN law—is something the Rebellion fabricated within PAN’s framework. The virus corrupted parts of PAN’s processing centers, and you were unlucky enough to be at the receiving end of this treachery during the Automated Work Reassignment. Due to your unwitting compliance in an act of treason against the Union, through no fault or knowledge of your own, you have been exonerated of all charges regarding your work performance failure.”

Leslie breathed deeply. “So… I can live.”

“Correct, Mr. Hill. However, after discovering your hidden identity as the Ponderosa Pines Executioner and your role in the forceful removal of nine workers of the Union, you will incur penalties commensurate with those listed in accordance with PAN Law 09663, as repayment for their sudden loss in productivity.”

“But I get to live.”

The woman rolled her eyes again and ignored him. “You will be Reassigned in the main lobby of this building before leaving. You will then be escorted to your new place of residency, where you will be allowed one day of rest and healing. Beginning Monday morning, you will report for work as specified in your occupational handbook.”

A large book was thrust into Leslie’s arms. He was given clean clothes and a ride to his new 12-by-12 apartment. And, of course, he received a new job.

He spent hours reading the manual on how to perform his duties as an Agricultural Secretary.

Eventually, he fell asleep and dreamed about nothing.

\*\*\*

Life went on. Leslie went to work on Monday and discovered that he was Agricultural Secretary to Travis Dollman, and so realized his fate was to not only file papers and answer phone calls but to endure the endless monologue of his new boss.

New stories of the “PAN glitches” began to pop up in the news regularly. Leslie wasn’t the only one Reassigned to a fake job. Apparently terrorism, gun smuggling, and rioting were circulating as legitimate occupations in the Work Reassignment Centers, and authorities at Infinitum hadn’t figured out how to counteract the damage that had been done.

Leslie took a huge cut in his ration supply: 0.25 times the average distribution (down from five times the normal amount in his previous “occupation”), to be carried out for the rest of his life. That was okay. Leslie could learn to live with less food and electricity.

A month into his job as Agricultural Secretary, Leslie’s bruises and lacerations had healed. He had a half-dozen scars where the probe had been inserted into his brain. He thought about his previous Reassignment every day, and the chaos and trauma it caused him and others.

He leaned against a rounded metal fence at the side of a river that crept between two cities. He felt a hand touch his spine. He spun around and saw the face of Blaise Parkham.

“Hey, you,” she said sadly.

He nodded politely. “Hello.”

“You made it out in one piece.” She rubbed a finger over his scars. “Well, not quite, I suppose.”

“Is there something I can do for you?”

“No. I just wanted to thank you for what you did.”

Leslie’s eyebrows furrowed. “For what I… did?”

She handed him a flyer, black and white with intricate geometric patterns in the corners. In the center, it read:

RAISE YOUR FISTS

FIGHT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

DOWN WITH THE GOD MACHINE

JOIN THE REBELLION

Leslie glanced from the flyer back to Blaise. “That was you? Everything I did… was because of you?”

She shrugged. “Not me personally. But yeah. My people.”

Leslie balled up the flyer in one hand. He felt angry enough to rip the metal fence from the ground.

“You used me as a tool. For what? This?” He shook the balled-up flyer in his hand. “The Rebellion?”

“For a chance to live a free life.”

“A free life?” Leslie shrieked. “Why in God’s name would you want that, if this is what we have to go through? We have work, housing, a steady supply of rations. Why do you care so much about your stupid cause that you’re willing to fuck everybody else to get it?”

Blaise pursed her lips. “Because Infinitum is pumping out killers, too. Not serial killers, but silent ones. They go into the houses of Rebellion members and black bag them. We don’t ever see them again. Those people you killed? We assigned you to do it because they were killing us.”

“Really? A brewery worker, a couple of real estate agents, a waitress? Two parents with a four-year-old child? These are the evil Rebellion killers?”

She nodded, ignoring the sarcasm. “Yes, they were. And they are just a microcosm of a massive, suppressed regime sanctioned by PAN itself.”

Leslie shook his head. He couldn’t believe it.

As if reading his thoughts, Blaise said, “You don’t have to believe me. But it’s true. Have a look for yourself.”

She offered him a tiny cardboard box large enough to house a wedding ring. Inside was a small chip with long, thin needles attached to it.

“I know your access to PAN is limited again. This will give you full access to all of its databases for 12 hours. After that, it fries. It’s not traceable, the encryption guarantees that. Just… take a look and see for yourself that I’m telling the truth.”

Leslie pocketed the device. “I’ll think about it,” he muttered bitterly.

“I’m sorry we used you,” Blaise said. “I’m not proud of it. But my convictions haven’t changed. I know why it had to be done. We had to send PAN and Infinitum a message. If I had to do it again, I would.”

“You would let me kill a boy’s parents in front of him again? For what? A chance at chipping away fragments of the so-called God Machine?”

She shook her head. “Not so you could kill a child’s parents, no. But for a chance to give that child a free world again, and his children after him? Yes, I would.”

They were silent for a long time. They stared at the horizon, the unwavering buildings set atop the restless water below. “PAN and Infinitum don’t care about us, Les,” Blaise continued. “They don’t care about anything but productivity, output, results. As long as they get that, the ends justify the means. They don’t care that we’re human beings, that we need more than just a stupid job. We need a purpose. And we need the room to find out for ourselves what that means.”

Leslie clenched his teeth, unwilling to release his bitterness. “I have a purpose. I’m an Agricultural Secretary. That’s what I do.”

Blaise stuffed her hands in her pockets and gave Leslie a light, sympathetic kiss on his cheek.

“Let me know if you change your mind.”

She left Leslie alone by the lake.

Leslie retrieved the tiny device from his pocket. He weighed the device and the crumpled flyer in his hands. He unfolded the flyer, smoothed out the wrinkles and read it again.

When he got home, he laid in bed for a long time, staring up at the ceiling. He unwrapped the tiny device and considered it.

He logged into his IPI. Then he lifted the chip to his forehead, and dug the needles into his scars.

Like the title says, about ten months ago, I found myself responding to this prompt one night:

> [**[WP] You have long been fascinated by swords, and have mastered every kind of sword fighting technique known to man. No man can defeat you. But you have grown old, and Death has crept up to deliver his final swing, but something happened, something Death had never experienced before, he was parried.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9sjttr/wp_you_have_long_been_fascinated_by_swords_and/)

Then, after serializing it on my subreddit and turning it into a story larger than I ever thought possible, I arrived at the decision about whether to make it a book. For a lot of writers, publishing a book is *the dream*, and in all honesty, I didn’t think I would ever actually do it. But now, after a lot of procrastination, a lot of late nights, a lot of learning, and a ton of editing, it’s here.

The entire series, named By The Sword, is a high fantasy trilogy of books with paranormal/supernatural elements, of which I’m publishing the first right now which comes in just shy of 100k words long. The book’s cover art was done by the fantastic /u/IsmaelGil, and I’m extremely happy with [how it turned out!](https://i.imgur.com/JIY228X.jpg)

As the title of this post says, that book is entitled Blood and Steel. You can read its synopsis right here:

> Death is a fickle thing.

> For most, it’s a force of nature, but Agil Novan sees the reaper in a different light. As the greatest swordsman of all time, he cherishes life, and he’s lived one full of both struggle and success. After all of his accomplishments, he too must face the reaper and its scythe.

> When challenged, however, the swordsman is not one to go without a fight. After parrying it once and impressing the reaper with a show of the blade, he is offered something more. A second chance at life—one that he is all but forced to accept.

> Now, stranded in an unfamiliar land with an unfamiliar body and far too many questions, Agil has his life threatened at every turn. Still, he is determined to survive. He knows what the reaper did to him. 

> And he has never been one to let vengeance go unfulfilled.

**You can check out the Amazon page for Blood and Steel [here, where you can buy it as an ebook!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X6S9FRT)**

---

Live by the sword, die by the sword. That was the way I lived for so long.

It was an old adage—ancient even, depending on the version being told, but it was a useful one for someone like me. 

I was first told it by my father during the final years of his life. It came only a few short months after I started training, in fact. A few short months of becoming fascinated by the art of sword-fighting and spending every waking minute trying to master it.

My father was proud of me for my effort. He always gave me the largest smile when I explained this stance or that, detailing my dreams of becoming the greatest swordsman of them all. Of becoming a Knight of Credon and protecting our kingdom more effectively than any before me. He entertained my teenage ramblings without complaint. And since he’d been a swordsman himself during his formative years, he made sure to pass off that ancient wisdom before it became too late.

It was the last gift he ever gave me.

If only I’d known how true it was.

That mantra repeated in my head now as I stared across my path. Standing out there in my field, only a few dozen paces away from me, the reaper stared right back. Wind billowed through its tattered black cloak. It made no effort to conceal the bleached bone underneath. All it did was balance its scythe in skeletal fingers as though taunting me to come and fight.

I wondered why it didn’t simply attack me for my ignorance, why it didn’t finish the job after I had ignored all of the signs. A tense pain in my chest and a sudden shortness of breath were the only warnings I’d gotten during my morning walk. But before the reaper had appeared, I’d shrugged them both off. I’d been stupid and short-sighted enough to allow my time to come.

Yet the reaper just stood there, watching me.

With my sword held at the ready, I considered if it was scared. Whether or not it was doubting the frozen moment in time when its scythe would harvest my soul. Perhaps it hadn’t expected me to resist, I ventured. After all, landing a strike on a swordsman of my caliber wasn’t easy for anyone.

The rational part of me didn’t think that was it, though. It didn’t fit with the concept of the end-bringer at all. The beast of decay was part of nature as we were told; it was integral to the cycle of the world. And while I’d never entirely agreed with that interpretation, especially not after my father had been ripped away from his life, it still shouldn’t have had any issue with a measly swordsman.

Then again, the word measly hadn’t described me for decades.

I stepped forward, my foot crunching on the path I walked almost every morning. *My* path, I reminded myself. The tranquil sanctuary that I’d cultivated for years. I was supposed to be safe when I walked it, and I had been until *it* had shown up.

A sneer formed on my face as I continued to approach. Its tattered cloak still drifted on the wind. Its scythe still balanced in silence. But as I neared, it looked up. It stared at me, nearly striking fear into my heart.

The reaper stopped and raised its scythe. It angled the ever-sharpened metal in my direction. For a moment, I could’ve sworn I saw a smile on its face. But I wasn’t sure, as it was already charging my way.

My body surged into action. The reaper disappeared from its spot and struck through the air like lightning to force me down with its scythe. Yet as the frozen moment passed with the shriek of clashing metal, I was left standing. The resistance was still fresh in my bones.

I’d parried it, I realized, on instinct and fear alone. As I glared back at its still form once more, picking apart details of the bone, I saw the surprise. I knew what it meant. The beast had never been parried before.

A grin grew across my lips as I readied my blade again. Its surprise would keep the scythe at bay for the moment, but I still had to be ready. I would never let my guard down.

As I’d expected, the surprise faded in short time and it was on me again. I watched it charge with inhuman speed, almost gliding over the ground. I only dodged with a stumble as its scythe cut right through where I’d been.

That attack had been faster than before, I noted. It had hit closer. I had to be ready.

I furrowed my brows and felt ice-cold fire flood my veins. It signaled the onset of battle, and I took the change in stride. Feeling the burn of sunlight on my skin, I stared back at the beast with everything I had and only barely ducked its next attempt at my life. The blade came through right where my head had been.

The scythe, however, never reached my former location. Instead, it turned at the last second. But even with the turn of steel, I was ready. It was one of the oldest tricks in the book. 

I parried the hit without a second thought. 

Surprise returned to its hooded, bleach-white face. The beast stared down at its unstained scythe, and I had to stifle a chuckle. It didn’t matter how fast it was. I would never let my guard down. 

I leapt backward, my feet already positioning themselves for the next attack. The beast growled, its tone dark enough to strike terror in any ordinary mind. But I was no ordinary mind—even at my age, I was as sharp. 

I narrowed my eyes, brought my sword out to the defense, and ignored the call to blunder. Its skeletal form charged me again—just as I’d predicted. My lips curled slightly as I turned in the nick of time and whipped the hilt of my blade around my wrist.

The clang that rang out was one to split mountains.

Both of our weapons fell, but I was more than ready for it. I swept mine up in an instant and was already twisting away. A smile blossomed across my lips. I would never let my guard down. 

Then, spinning back with my blade in hand, I shoved steel deep into the hooded cloak. My ears twitched at the screech of metal tearing through bone.

As soon as I heard it, I retracted my arm. My feet pushed me backward, and I swung my blade out to guard. Looking over the serene path turned battlefield, I saw too many familiar things. The ornate stone lining in the dirt. The shaded patch of trees. My humble homestead barely visible over the hills.

It had no right to be here, I told myself. It had no right to take me here. This was my *home,* world’s dammit. And I would never let my guard down.

Images flashed through my mind—parries, deflects, attacks. I was ready. The power in my muscles was already responding to clean commands. But as it turned out, none of it was needed.

The beast stood, paralyzed. 

Carrying the same surprise it had shown seconds before, the reaper stared at the grass. Its ash-black robe wavered in the breeze and its skeletal form hunched as though responding to a weight. Watching it, I relaxed my shoulders a hair. The situation was painted clear as day on its face. It had never been hit before either.

Ragged black cloth lifted back off its head to expose pale white bone to the sunlight above. Its dark eyes were riddled with confusion when it turned to me. It stared, and I almost looked, almost sealed my glorious fate. But at the last moment, I recognized the trick. 

Darkness crawled out of its eyes. I snapped mine shut before it could take me, my father’s proud face flashing in my mind. Another one of his warnings played back through my head.

*Never look into the face of death.*

The embodiment of decay rushed at me anew—I felt it in the air. Heard it. *Smelled* it. Its speed was even greater than before and I only barely shook off the strike. Even with my eyes closed, with my most important sense stripped away, I would never let my guard down.

I snapped my eyes open while sprinting away, readied for the attacks that were sure to hit my unarmed side. I waited, my ears perked and my eyes sharp. The strikes never came. 

After a dozen strides, I turned back to the beast, expecting to see the same dry surprise as before. I didn’t. Instead, I saw the beast’s cracked, white skull with the hood completely off.

Bitterness fell on my tongue. It coated my mouth with disgust. I felt power radiating from in front of me; I felt it washing off the bone. Simply looking into its face forced my blood to run cold. Where I’d expected to see the same complete and utter shock, I saw confirmation of what I hadn’t wanted to be true. An expression more terrifying than any other.

A smile.

The crooked, skeletal grin was perfect and horrid at the same time. It spawned a sense of worry deep within me that I rejected as unnatural. I was a warrior, a swordsman, a *knight*—I didn’t have time for worry. And yet, as I felt my gaze stay frozen, the dread only deepened. 

The beast didn’t rush at me. It didn’t move to attack. It didn’t even reach for its scythe. For some reason, it seemed done with the fight.

“Impressive display,” it said, words reaching my ears on the wind. Its voice came like the concept of decay itself, forcing me to shudder as it ate at my mind. I hadn’t seen its bony mouth move an inch.

“Thank you,” I replied through gritted teeth, unconsciously getting myself into stance.

The beast noticed and raised a dismissive hand. “There is no need for that. I have no intention of keeping this up.”

“Then what do we do now?” I asked, keeping my gaze as harsh as nails. My fingers curled around my blade’s loyal grip. I knew it was playing with me—I knew the reaper’s words were a trick, but I would never let my guard down.

The beast chuckled dryly. ”You are unique.”

I glared at the thing, barely avoiding its eyes. It was toying with me and I knew it. Why couldn’t I take advantage? Why couldn’t I just strike now? No, I thought, dismissing the questions. It was smarter than that. It knew I wouldn’t let my guard down, and it wouldn’t let its guard down either. 

“And?” was the only word I mustered in response.

“It would be a shame to let someone like you fall to the house of the dead.”

My gaze lifted, brows furrowing on my face. “What are you getting at?”

“I could give you another chance,” it said, the tone of its voice spawning hatred deep in my chest. The beast’s smile all but dropped as the force in its words made one thing abundantly clear.

It was serious. 

My mind raced, remembering my younger form longing for more time by the sword. Would it really give me another chance? 

“Yes,” it said, the dark words dragging hope out of my soul.

“What’s the catch?” I asked.

Its grin returned, more devilish than before. A chill ran down my spine. “You will have a different body. But you will retain your mind. Life would be more a curse if I were to take that from you.”

I considered the offer against my better judgment. The same instincts that were guiding my stance screamed at me to stop. But as I stared at the beast, sunlight dancing on cracked bone, I could find no fault in its intentions.

“What do I have to do?”

Its grin grew wider. “One touch—and a new life is yours.”

Overcome by a dark, sudden, inexorable urge, I agreed. As though manipulated by some outside force, the desperation in my mind preyed on my memories and won out over all doubt. The reaper appeared next to me like a shot of ashen lightning.

Its finger approached my shoulder, cooling the air around it as it went. My grip tightened and my mind screamed, but it was already too late. The bleach-white bone touched my skin and my body filled with ice. 

My mind burned. My bones froze. And I experienced the most agonizing second of the rest of my life before everything went black.

---

A jolt of motion startled me up from my slumber. I twisted, feeling only the most distant of pain. Everything was numb. A cold, unfamiliar haze was draped over my mind. I stared into the black, faintly wishing for the ability to feel again. Unfortunately, my wish was granted in short time.

My body snapped up. A frigid wind crashed against my face, sending shivers down my spine and a howl through my ears. In a second, everything came back and my mind spun through the images. New mixed with old and familiar with foreign as my mind swirled, but I couldn’t make sense of any of it. I clenched my jaw and waited for it to stop. And yet, as soon as it did, one thought was left, one that forced my lips into a smile. 

The beast hadn’t lied. 

When I opened my eyes, I hoped to see my land. I hoped to see my fields, the rows of crops that I was no longer even required to tend. I hoped to see my wife, the beautiful face that just barely escaped me. But the eyes that only vaguely felt like my own were met with a completely different sight. 

All around me, spinning in the wind as if just to mock me for my choices, was a dark forest that I couldn’t recognize. Feeling the horrid cold cut deeper, my smile faded.

I forced myself up, noting soreness in my bones. My muscles were hollow. My arms were shorter. My legs were… different. Everything about me felt *frail*, as if on the verge of collapse. And as I sat up on whatever rock my body had been strewn across, I felt sharp pain cut a deep pit through my stomach.

My brain started to spin again, the foreign thoughts, worries, and memories all coming back at once. As the waves passed, they were replaced with regret that was only my own. I shivered, the truth cementing in my mind.

This wasn’t what I’d wanted. It wasn’t what I’d wanted at all. I closed my eyes—if they even were my eyes—and shook my head, trying to force it all away. My efforts were useless as the world set in and one horrible thought echoed out in my head.

*I’d let my guard down.*

*****

I would’ve settled for a boring superpower. 20/20 vision. Perfect pitch. The ability to draw a perfect circle 100% of the time. Or no power at all even. No-shows actually get non-ability checks from the government now since they passed that law six months ago. No powers would have been better than what I wound up with.

I walk into the diner at 8:45. The last rays of the sinking sun temporarily warming the chill evening air. I usually go out as late as possible to minimize the number of people I run into. At this hour, there are only three patrons: a middle aged man sitting at the counter and a couple at a booth. A pair of bells above the door ring as it shuts behind me. 

“Come on in, have a seat!” I hear someone call out from the kitchen. “Be right with ya!”

I take a seat at the far end of the restaurant. It’s been five years since I discovered what my power was. It possibly started to manifest sooner but there’s no way of telling when. Most people get them in their teens, around puberty. Some kids take to their powers immediately, some develop them slowly over time. Some are late bloomers, and a rare few just never get any. 

Just like with puberty, it can be an awkward time. A friend of mine found out she could fly when she shot over the school on track and field day. Another kid I knew hit a baseball into orbit at a little league game. Destroyed a $70,000 solar panel on the ISS. That one made the news. You learn to control it more or less, but nobody really gets a hang of their powers until they meet the one.

The scientists don’t know how to explain it, but they think it’s a hormonal thing. They still don’t know if it’s the relationship that stabilizes the powers or the sudden improvement or amplification of both powers that solidifies the bond. But my friend found a guy who could control air currents. Turns out he could never generate enough lift to take off, but together she can lift him and he can whisk them along. They’ve been married for two years now. The guy with super strength kept hurting himself from constantly breaking things with his ability. During one of his extended stays at the hospital, he met a girl there for much the same reason. They knew it was a match made in heaven when they shook hands and didn’t crush each other’s fingers. Together, along with therapy and practice, I hear they’ve stopped tearing doors off hinges and breaking down walls.

I’m brought out of my reminiscing when I hear the couple across the room laughing merrily. There’s a spoon levitating between them. It dips into a dessert on the plate and floats gently over to girl and she takes a bite. They both laugh. He keeps saying things like “so what about this…” and “or how about…” Every time he pauses she giggles again, as if he’s just told a joke. I try not to think about it, but deep down, I secretly know the worst thing about my ability is that I’ll never find someone who I could be with.

Just then, the waitress zips out from the kitchen. I say zips because she’s moving almost too fast to track. She busses a table in one corner of the room, gives the man at the counter his bill, and refills the couple’s coffee cups in ten seconds flat. By the time I register that she’s on her way towards me, it’s too late to call out.

As soon as she gets within two meters of me, she immediately decelerates to a regular pace. Her shoes skid on the linoleum tiles and she goes sprawling to the ground in front of me with a loud grunt that sounds more surprised than hurt. The menu she was holding flies across the room. Everyone turns to look, startled. I flinch.

“Sally? Is everything okay?” I see a cook poke his head out of the kitchen. “What the hell happened?!”

I was out of my seat and helping her up about two seconds after she hit the floor. The man from the counter comes over with the cook.

“Ah… I’m alright Harry. I-I guess I tripped.” She winces as she gets to her feet. The skin on her knees and palms is badly scraped.

“Tripped?” the chef grunts. “Two years you been workin’ here and I ain’t never even seen you drop a spoon. You feeling alright hon?” The waitress, Sally, nods. “Jesus Sal, look at your hands!”

The man from the counter clears his throat.

“I believe I can help with that miss. I’m a doctor.”

“Oh it’s nothing a little iodine and some bandages wouldn’t fix doc, don’t worry about it.” The doctor smiles.

“Why don’t I just show you?” He takes her hands gently in his and… nothing happens. He turns his palms over, looking confused. “I don’t understand… there’s usually a slight glow… the wounds should be healing…” He seems understandably troubled.
The waitress gives a little gasp. “So it’s not just me… just before I fell, I think… I think my powers just… stopped working.” She gingerly rubs her wrist. “What about you Harry?” The cook thrusts a hand out. Nothing happens. He tries again. Still nothing.

“What in the hell… mine was working just a minute ago… this is weird.” He turns to me. “How about you buddy?”

All this time I’ve been shrinking back, my face feeling hot. Now I can’t bring myself to meet their gazes.

“Uh… my powers are working just fine, actually…” This is met with confused stares from the other two, but the doctor’s eyes light up.

“Ah I see. You’re a null, aren’t you?” I grimace at the term. From across the room, the spoon floating between the two lovebirds clatters noisily to the table. I grit my teeth. This hasn’t gone unnoticed by the doctor, who looks at the young couple and then back to me. My ears are burning now. I know I’ve technically done nothing wrong, but in a society where not having a superpower is considered a disability, taking them away might as well be a criminal act.

Harry the chef scratches his chin thoughtfully. “I ain’t never heard of that kinda’ power…”

“I’m really sorry miss” but she shakes her head.

“It’s not like you did it on purpose, hey? I guess I ought to be more careful sometimes.”

“What’s the range of your, ah, talent?” the doctor asks. 

“I can usually keep it to about two or three meters…” His eyes dart to the couple and back. “I should probably go… I’m sorry.”

“Naw, naw, kid, sit down. This I gotta see,” the cook says with a grin. That’s because it wasn’t a paramedic trying to heal a near-fatal injury or a firefighter trying to lift a broken beam off someone this time.

I take a deep breath and sit down. Closing my eyes, I go over the steps like I have a thousand times before. The chef takes a step back, then another. Suddenly, a little flame puffs into life in the middle of his palm. He chuckles. The doctor gently leads the waitress away. A soft white glow shines from his hands. The waitress straightens up. There’s not a scratch on her anymore.

“Wow Doc! The pain’s all gone too!” In the blink of an eye she retrieves the discarded menu and zooms back, coming to a careful stop before she gets too close. She walks towards me with exaggerated steps and hands it over. “No harm, no foul?” She smiles politely. The chef claps me on the shoulder and walks away. The doctor gives me a meaningful smile, tinged with pity.

“Uh… thanks…” With the show over Sally the supersonic waitress takes my order and then whips across the room to the couple. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but at one point or another each looks at me. The familiar feeling settles over me. That’s what it’s like, having my power. I couldn’t repel people any more if I had wound up with magnetism instead. Sally whips up with a pot of coffee and a mug, again coming to a halt before walking towards me, pouring and walking away.

The bell at the door jangles again. A young woman enters. I keep my eyes on the steam rising from the mug. 

“Take a seat hon, I’ll be right with ya.” The woman quickly finds a seat by the back, walking between tables. Sally, already back to her old rhythm it seems, goes zooming around to greet the new customer. She procures another cup and speeds over. What happens next only takes moments. In short order, the waitress roughly bumps into the table instead of stopping, fumbling with the pot and accidentally splashing coffee. The woman cries out and Sally immediately apologizes. Without thinking, she sets the pot down and bolts away to get a napkin—shooting right past the counter at twice the usual speed. She careens into a wall with a thwack that sounds significantly more painful than embarrassing and flops onto her back, out cold. There are a few seconds of stunned silence.

Harry pokes his head out from the kitchen: “Again Sal? How many times are—” he trails off when he sees her unmoving on the floor. “Jesus Christ! Sally!” The doctor is already by her side, hands glowing. He stops the chef before he can exit from behind the counter.

“You need to call an ambulance. Right now. This is beyond my talent to fix alone.” He turns back to the unconscious waitress, face grim. A big gash has opened up on her forehead.
“What the hell happened!?” 

“Oh God… I—I’m so sorry…” The woman who walked in is now on her feet, face white as a sheet, hands clasped in front of her mouth. A loud pinging sound interrupts before she can say another word. I turn in the direction of the young couple, who are both sitting mouth agape, staring at the same unfortunate spoon, now embedded in the far wall. Then the girl cries out.

“Jane!” This is her date, leaping across to see if she’s okay. The doctor strains his neck trying to see what’s going on. “I’m so sorry, I don’t know what happened, the spoon, it just—I never…” but she’s not listening. She doesn’t appear hurt. Not physically. Still, she puts her hands over her ears and shrieks.
“Rich, oh God Rich, make it stop! It’s too loud! Too many voices!” The girl collapses out of her seat curling into a ball on the floor. “Make it stop!” she pleads. “Please make it stop!”

The boy doesn’t know what to do. He’s rubbing her back, trying to help. Silverware, dishes, table settings, all around the diner are starting to rattle.

“What the HELL IS GOING ON?!” Harry shouts above the din. Things devolve quickly after that. The glow from the doctor’s hands explodes into a brilliant whiteness. Sally’s eyes snap open and she arches her back with a loud gasp. 

“How…?” that doctor’s eyes widen in alarm. Simultaneously, both of Harry’s hands erupt in flames. 

“GAH FUCK!” The bewildered chef starts waving them around wildly, his sleeves catching fire. The girl Jane is still keening on the floor. Rich is crouched by her side, a maelstrom of utensils and tableware starts whirling around the room. Through it all, the young woman is still standing, frozen. Tears of fear and horror pouring down her cheeks. A look I’ve never seen on someone else.

Then it clicks.

I stand up and walk over through all the chaos, until I’m right beside her. I put my hand on her shoulder and turn her to face me. She meets my gaze. Something in my eyes must be speaking to her too, and that’s when I know for sure. I wrap my arms around her and pull her close. She’s soft and small and smells like lavender. I feel hot tears soaking through my shirt.

“It’s okay,” I say. “Everything is going to be okay.”

Everything stops, all at once.

All the dishes fall to the floor. The blinding light from the doctor’s hands disappears. Harry’s firearms sputter and go out. The room is silent, except for a few whimpers coming from Jane, and the muffled sobbing coming from the woman in my arms. 

The doctor tends to everyone in short order. Sally was fine the moment the flash hit. He says he never had results that fast, even with his partner right next to him. Harry has some light burns, but the doc takes care of those. Besides needing a new shirt and having no more hair on his arms, he’s fine. He grumbles about closing early tonight. Sally agrees. Rich had a cut above the eye where an errant saucer clipped him, and Jane had a small headache, but both are no worse for wear.

He approaches me wordlessly. There’s a small gash on my forearm I didn’t notice in all the confusion. He holds out his hand to heal it. I start to protest, but before I can say anything, the warm glow appears around his fingers. My arm tingles for a moment and when he pulls away, I see my cut is gone. I’m flabbergasted, but the doctor smiles knowingly. He gives me a nod and a wink and walks away.

I turn my attention to the woman. My soul mate, I realize, and I don’t even know her name yet. I loosen my embrace and she pulls her head away, but her arms are still tightly wrapped around me, and mine around her. She looks blurry. I blink and wipe at my eyes. Her face is red and raw and beautiful. Messy hair and cheeks shiny with tears. The red rimming her eyes makes the blue inside them pop. 

“Hi” I say. She laughs. A low, soft giggle. I can’t help but laugh a little too.

“Hi.” She buries her face in my chest and says something else, but I can’t make it out. 

“What was that?” I ask.

“Don’t let go,” she repeats, softly. “Don’t ever let go.”

“I won’t. I promise.”

There was more gold to be grabbed, more jewels to steal, but he took me. A *chair*. I think he wanted a memento; he never went on another adventure after that, instead opting to use the riches from his adventuring to build this cosy little tavern with me as a prized seat for guests of honour. *The chair from his final grand exploit.* A relic of his old life.

I could've eaten him of course. Would have been easy. He had no idea I was a mimic. Spent much of the travels on his back, near him when he slept, all exceedingly vulnerable times when I could have struck. But... to see the outside world after so long? See how much has changed over the centuries? Weighed against a single meal, the choice was clear. And with that, I was just a chair in a tavern.

And it's incredible.

I had no idea how much I was missing stuck in that dusty old castle. There is so much to be experienced, to be seen! I have seen people of races, shapes and colours I never dared imagine. I've learned languages I would have once thought to be simple noise. I've heard tales of love lost and triumph earned. This tavern teems with life, with variety, and I'd not give it up for anything.

Oh and the food! I never hurt a hair on the patrons, but... sometimes they rest a meal on me for a moment or some scraps fall off the table. You might think it undignified, but compared to eating rats and men alike in a dungeon? I was eating like a king, both in variety and in style. There are these little things made of flour and eggs - dumplings I believe - that are simply to die for.

And so I have lived for 33 outstanding years.

But, well, trouble had to come a' knocking at some point. This time in the form of 3 low-life scum who thought the jolly tavern of an old man would make an easy target. They broke the window with a club and poured in, stinking of manure and ill-intentions. Before too long they started pocketing anything that seemed of value. Silverware, glass cups, bottles of spirit... it reminded me of the many so-called 'heroes' I've met back in my day. I could have tolerated it, perhaps, had Eleanor - his wife - not come down to investigate the noise.

""Hey! Who ar-""

She barely got three words out before one of them smacked her across the head with the club he'd been carrying, knocking her to the ground. And with that, my patience was out.

I was rusty. Had not been in a fight for 33 years. But these ingrates might as well have been sheep. The crunching of their bones, the blood splatters on the wall, the screams of pure unbridled terror... brought back memories. Not all good. But... with a past like mine? You're gonna carry that weight.

The adventurer - well, I don't think he'd call himself that anymore with his grey hair and wrinkled face - rushed in with his sword drawn, just seconds too late to see me. He was shockingly spry for a man of his age. Old habits die hard, don't they, old friend? He inspected the room with an experienced eye, noting the blood and body parts but seeing his wife, forgot all of that and rushed to her aid.

""El!"" he yelled. ""Are you alright?""

She sat up clutching her forehead. ""Oh... dammit. The sucker blindsided me,"" she said and pulled her hand away. There was a fair amount of blood on it.

""Gods, you're bleeding. Here, let me-""

And to both mine and his surprise, she laughed. ""Oh come on,"" she said. ""This? This is nothing. I may be old but I'm not *decrepit*, Mikah. Remember that troll in Lower Durth? Now *that* was an injury.""

He chuckled and helped her sit on a nearby chair. ""My... you did a number on them,"" she said and gestured towards the carnage in the tavern. ""Haven't changed one bit,"" she smiled.

He narrowed his eyes suspiciously and walked forward, inspecting the bodies, blood, the pattern of their injuries... all leading back to me. A tooth fell off of me with a soft tap on the wooden floor. He approached me cautiously; I felt the heat radiating from his sword, the silver lining threatening a terrible pain should it fall upon me.

And when he got too close, I slipped. I creaked. He gripped his sword tighter but then... relaxed. He looked at the bodies of the brigands and then at his wife - alive and mostly well. His face shifted and cycled through several different emotions before his eyes softened and he sheathed his sword, returning to his wife.

""Come,"" he said. ""Let's get that cleaned up.""

""Who were they anyway?"" she asked. ""Thieves?""

""Think so.""

""Heh,"" she chuckled. ""Maybe they were after your 'famous' special chair.""

""You know,"" he said and turned towards me briefly with a smile, ""after all this time, I see it more as... an old friend.""

It started as a WP response and turned into a series that I wrote on my sub each day, for a few weeks. I then spent some time editing it, and put it together as a 30k+ words novella - and now here it is!

It's called The Carnival of the Night, and here's the blurb:

> Some call it purgatory, others know it as the in-between, but for those poor souls who are trapped there eternally, it is simply The Carnival — a macabre mockery where night is never-ending, and a sadistic creature known as The Fool reigns unchallenged.

> And The Fool has one rule: No one leaves The Carnival. Ever.

> Christopher, the latest arrival thrust reluctantly through the gates, is certain that he doesn't belong there, and he's damn sure he's not staying. 

> To have any chance of escaping, he must confront not only The Fool, but his own dark past.


# [Amazon link - $2.99 for an ebook or $7.99 for the print](https://www.amazon.com/Carnival-Night-Nicholas-Carey-ebook/dp/B07B8PLZK7/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521552336&sr=8-1)

The ebook is available everywhere, but I think some places won't be able to get the print version (Canada, being one). The entire story is available, unedited, on [my sub](/r/nickofnight). It's a little over 30k words, which puts it in the novella category. 

I just wanted to say thank you to the community! It's where I started writing, and I'll be continuing to write here. I'm already deep into a new series! If it wasn't for all the encouraging comments and creative prompts, I certainly wouldn't have anything up on Amazon, and I might not be writing at all. So, thank you!

Below is the first chapter of the novella. 

Thanks again!

---

""Hey,"" Christopher said with a dismissive nod. ""What's up?""

The girl stared up at him from her seat, her face pale, her eyes wide. But she said nothing.

Her reaction threw the boy off his game, flustering him ever so slightly. He'd never just been... *looked at*. Laughed at, sure. Told to get lost, a few times. But never simply stared at.

""Uh, is that a ladder in your tights or, uh..."" He cursed himself for forgetting the end of the chat-up line. When he realized she wasn't even wearing tights beneath her skirt, he cursed again. 

Still she stared.

Clearly not a fan of cheesy opening lines. ""I kind of like your freckles,"" he tried. ""They're like tiny grains of sand ironed in by golden sunlight."" There, that sounded better. Almost Shakespearean. *Probably*.

No reaction. Just those huge eyes that seemed to stare right through him.

Enough was enough. Christopher waved a hand in front of her face. *""Hello? Anyone home?""*

The girl blinked. ""*You can see me*,"" she said slowly. It was more of a statement than a question. ""You can, can't you?""

Christopher looked around, wondering if she was in fact talking to him — but the bus was otherwise empty. He could feel his cheeks burning. *Come on Christopher, say something.*

""I uh... Yeah, I got twenty-twenty vision. So don't worry, I can see you just *fine*. Can… can you see *me*?"" He winked, hoping more than believing, that the question sounded sexy. Maybe it was at least *flirty*?

""Sit,"" she hissed.

""Maybe I don't want to,"" Christopher taunted, his swagger slowly returning.

*""Fucking sit. Now!""*

With a last glance at the empty seats around him, he slid down next to her. ""Okay, wow, I guess I can play by those rules.""

The girl didn't look at him, instead choosing to stare out of the window at the rolling hills beyond, dyed a lazy orange by the low sun. ""What time is it?"" she asked without looking away.

""Do you mean...""

""*The time. On your watch*. I think it's a question even *you* can handle.""

Christopher frowned, half enjoying her playfulness. ""Seven-thirty.""

""Morning or evening?""

""Uh... morning. *Obviously*.""

""Then why, Christopher, is the sun setting?""

A chill ran down the boy's spine. ""How the hell do you know my-""

""Why is the sun setting,"" she repeated, ""if it's the morning?""

""It's *rising*, I'd guess. I mean, I didn't do great at physics but I think I've got that one covered — I only got up like an hour ago. Now tell me, *who are you?* Have you been spying on me — do you sit back here and watch me each day? Or… *oh shit*, have you hacked my phone? I mean... I guess I'm flattered..."" He ran a hand through his hair. ""But it's a little creepy. And uh, those pictures… well, you should know that's not *my*-""

""It's *setting*. The light is orange not yellow, and it's getting darker by the minute. We're getting close.""

Christopher rolled his eyes. ""Sure. Okay, the sun is setting at seven-thirty in the fucking morning.""

""Why did you get on this bus, Christopher?""

""... Huh? Well, so I didn't miss it. Why else do people-""

""Where's it going?""

""To... to..."" *Where the hell was it going?* ""I-""

""Listen to me carefully, because this is going to be hard for you to hear. You died, Christopher. Your bike was hit by a car this morning. You are dead.""

The boy laughed, but a nervousness had crept into his throat. ""What is wrong you with you? Why would you say something like that?""

""Touch the back of your head.""

""You're pretty messed up, you know that?"" he replied, but found himself reaching over his shoulder. His hand trembled as it touched... *hair*. Christopher let out a sigh that quickly turned into a swear as he felt first the wet stickiness, and then below it, a hole that his fingers slid into. They were met by a mushy texture and a sloppy squishing; Christopher wanted nothing more than to vomit.

""What the fuck!"" he screamed, as he jumped up and staggered down the aisle. ""*What's going on... What's going on... What's going on!?*""

The girl leapt up from her seat, grabbed Christopher's hand, and yanked him back down.

""Do *not* let the driver see you,"" she said slowly, sternly. ""Or you won't even make it as far as purgatory.""

Seven years and hundreds of such stories later, I feel like I’m finally able to write a novel that I can be proud of. And that doesn’t come easy for me.

I’ve worked really hard on it, and I’m so excited to show you **Dating a Demon!** 

It’s a novel that derives characters and concepts from *Dante’s Inferno* and *the Book of Revelation*, and weaves mythology and lore into an epic fantasy tale of love and deceit, where archangels and demon lords battle for dominion over Heaven, Hell, and everything in between.

Blurb:

>As it turns out, Amanda’s long-time pen pal isn’t just devilishly handsome – he’s an actual demon and the new King of Hell, and he has a proposal for her:

>Marry him and rule by his side.

>Considering his nature, Amanda is reluctant to become his eternal bride. Instead, she agrees to go on a date. They have, after all, been trading letters of hopes and dreams for years, and she’s always had a bit of a crush on him. 

>But on top of all the troubles that come with dating a demon, someone has decided to interfere. Someone who is more than willing to challenge the new king for the crown, jeopardize the millennia-long peace between Heaven and Hell, and straight up sabotage Amanda’s date. 

>That someone is Lucifer.

Dating a Demon is available worldwide on Kindle and in paperback.

**1**

Amanda kicked and screamed, the hardened brimstone ripping her pajamas to shreds. Crying, she landed on the blackened floor of an immense chamber. The demon let go of her ankle, and the gate slammed shut behind her.

For a while, only her ragged breathing echoed through the room. Then there was a crackle of fire.

“I apologize on behalf of Abaddon,” a silky voice said from the far corner of the room. “He can be a bit... inconsiderate at times.”

“What's happening?” Amanda said, rubbing her eyes. “Where am I?”

“Why, Hell, of course.”

“Why, what did I do wrong?”

“Oh, nothing, my dear. You wrote in your last letter that you wanted to meet before answering my proposal.”

Amanda stood up and her eyes suddenly narrow. “You’re Marc?”

“It’s actually pronounced with an s-sound as in Marcellixis. But yeah.”

Amanda looked at the silhouette sitting on the throne. His red eyes burned like hot iron in the darkness. “So… everything you wrote about hell and suffering and brimstone, that wasn’t metaphorical?”

Marc shrugged. “I do enjoy a bit of hyperbole every now and then, but no, most of it was literal.”

“So, what, you're going to try and make me fall in love with you now?”

“I’m not going to make you do anything, you came here of your own free will, remember?”

“This is preposterous!” Amanda said, pushing her shoulder against the massive doors.

“I've been accused of worse.”

The demon rose from the throne and sauntered up to her. His long mane of onyx hair swirled behind him like smoke. His pearly skin and chiseled face were not what she had expected.

“Let’s just have a date like we agreed on, and see where things lead,” he said.

“What if you fall in love with me, and I don't want you back?”

“Oh, please.”

“What? It's a legitimate question.”

He leaned casually against the brimstone wall. A brilliant white smile parted his lips. He winked at her.

“I, um...” She looked down at her feet. “It... it doesn't matter. Looks don't matter.”

“You already know everything about me.” The demon leaned in, and the breath in her ear sent a shiver rolling down her spine. “The looks are just a bonus.”

“I think this is a bad idea…”

“What’s the worst that could happen?”

She swallowed hard. No way. He was evil incarnate. There was no way.

“Let’s go on that date, what do you say?” he continued, running a nail down her shoulder.

“You can’t make me fall in love with you if I don’t want to,” Amanda said finally.

“Oh, I would never dream of that.” He looked into the distance. “True love is precious. But if we end up just friends, I’m okay with that too. We’re friends, right?”

Amanda nodded. “One date.”

“That’s all I ask for.”

“Okay, then. But not here. On Earth.”

“Deal,” the demon said, grinning. “I've made a reservation at La Guinness for eight o'clock. Don't be late.”

*

Amanda opened her eyes, gasping. The alarm clock on her nightstand showed 03:33. She groaned and rolled over, trying to go back to sleep. It had only been a dream.

That's when she noticed the letter on her pillow. In the light from her phone, she tore it open. There was a note inside.

*Dear Amanda,*

*I enjoyed our first meeting very much, and I'm looking forward to our first date!*

*Yours truly,*

*Marc*

It only happens once every several generations, and always alerts the curiosity of the whole world. In the past, the birth of a *null*, as they were now known, had heralded a period of great turmoil. They were the source of superstition and ritual, so it was no surprise that people tried to kill or control them as soon as they heard about them.

Today, things had become marginally more civilised…but only marginally. There was nowhere for a *null* to turn for help; they were so rare that they didn’t factor into anyone’s thoughts even remotely. That is, until I was born. 

The hospital where I was delivered hadn’t bothered to check for manacytes in my blood. Why would they? It was only when my parents took me in for further tests when I was a child and hadn’t manifested yet, and even then only after a veritable battery of tests had been done beforehand that the doctors suggested they test for manacyte deficiency. They had their work cut out convincing my parents it was the right thing to do. Who would want a *null* for a child? “You’ll always be our baby, no matter what” they’d said. 

The test results proved them wrong. 

The minute they saw what I was, they changed their tune. “It must be a mistake…did they make a mistake with the babies in the hospital?”. They were cold to me from then on, and didn’t need much convincing when the doctors offered to keep me in the facility for more tests. They needed even less convincing when the authorities asked them to sign me over to them for permanent guardianship. 

The last I heard of them, my father had divorced my mother on the grounds that she had been unfaithful, while she maintained vehemently that she had never broken her vows. 

That was all I remembered of warmth, of family. From then on it was a world of cold and loneliness.  I knew they hadn’t meant it at the time, but I still held on to my memories of my parents from before my diagnosis. It helped me get through the daily barrage of tests and exercises they made me do. The physical tests were easy to get used to, after a while. I could distract myself from the pain eventually. The psychological tests were what I abhorred most. 

I didn’t know much about myself, but I knew I was a psychopath. I had once overheard one of them saying “well of course there’s psychopathic tendencies here. What do you expect when all we do is prod and poke it like cattle? Christ, George, it doesn’t know what human warmth even is!”

---------------------

Today was different.

I wasn’t woken up by the guard that would take me to my morning intravenous ration. I didn’t know how I knew it, but I had woken up early, and the moon was out. I just *knew* it was. I sat up straight on the edge of my bed, looking down at my hands. I found them profoundly fascinating for some reason. And I felt…*different*. As I held my hands up to my face, I noticed the dim red glow of the surveillance drone. The guard would be here any minute. 

He was a Newtonian; he could affect one of the forces around him. His speciality was Gravity. He had used it to slam me into walls or contort me into all manner of twisted shapes when I had done something to displease him. 

As I heard his footsteps getting closer and louder, I felt something I hadn’t felt before. Confidence. 

He slammed the door open and held out his hand, ready to twist me back into bed. It was then that I did something I hadn’t done in a long time; I spoke. As I felt him take his stance, ready to use his powers on me, something in me urged me to scream. 

“**No!**”

If he was startled by my sudden verbalisations, he didn’t show it. He twisted his fingers, ready to throw me against the wall. I closed my eyes and braced myself for impact. 

Nothing happened. 

I opened my eyes to a look of utter bewilderment on his face. I heard his superior chime in on his comms device. “What’s taking so long? Get on with it”. He shook his head, a look of determination replacing his bewildered expression, and took his stance again. 

Nothing. 

He hadn’t figured it out yet, but I had. I started walking over to him, smiling. The look of confusion turned to terror as he noticed me pacing towards him.

---------------------

“I’ve studied the tapes over and over again. Why yes, I do have a theory as to what happened. Do you know how long we’ve been calling them “*nulls*”? No? Neither does anyone else, which means the word is at least as old as the English language. All this time we thought it referred to the fact that they didn’t have any powers, George. No manacytes in the blood. But it’s more than that. They can *nullify* the powers of others, George. That’s where the term comes from. Someone, long ago, discovered this fact about them and it was lost through the ages…no doubt the countless wars fought in their name had something to do with it. That’s what happened with the guards and the scientists that were cut down during the escape. They simply didn’t know how to react to not having something they took for granted all their lives. Imagine being in their position, George. It’s like suddenly losing a limb! Proceed with caution. We don’t know the full extent of this ability to nullify. Be careful!”

In a world where everyone has superpowers, having no power is a terrible thing.

**EDIT 2**: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8d1wh3/wp_in_a_world_where_everyone_is_born_with_super/) is a link to the original WP. I've since deleted my reply to the thread as I've posted it here. 

**EDIT 3**: I've been working on expanding this story. Jumping off [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8de37y/piin_a_world_where_everyone_is_born_with_super/dxmlr1b/) comment I made earlier, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/8cn7we/wp_you_are_a_normal_person_with_a_superpowered/dxgkwer/) is the story about the brother of a Von Neumann based on one of my earlier stories (I mean to change some of the details to keep with the theme of the universe). I want to use their story as a vehicle to convey how the social and political structure works in a world with super-powered beings. I also mean to provide greater coverage on how the powers work, specifically in terms to limitations around their use. 

**EDIT 4**: I've decided that I'm definitely going to write more about this universe, which I'm really excited to explore in greater detail! If you'd like to keep abreast of any progress and updates I make, please follow my personal subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/phreaklikeme/). I'll be doing a shoutout comment to everyone that asked to be kept informed of updates shortly, apologies in advance for the ping!"

It's been a crazy couple of weeks! I wrote [a response to a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/804ohs/wp_youre_able_to_see_a_status_window_over_other/) where everyone in the main character's world has a status window hovering over their heads--except her. Now it's a finished sci-fi novella called [**The Control Group**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BF9N6VM)!

Here's a quick summary:

>Eris Flynn lives in a perfect world where there is no pain, no worries, and no death. Yet, even in this ideal existence, Eris has always felt like an outsider -- the only person missing a glowing box above their head, indicating their name, mood, and health.
>
>Until today.
>
>It was chance that she met the man on the street. The man missing the same box above his head as Eris. He claimed to have answers to questions she'd never even thought to ask. Questions that threaten her very reality and everything she once accepted as truth.
>
>Unless Eris can determine what's real and what's fake, it could mean not just the end of Eris, but the end of existence as we have always known it.

###[Amazon link - $2.99 for an ebook or $8.99 for the print (ebook included!)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BF9N6VM)

The ebook is available in all markets, and the print copy is available everywhere Amazon is willing to ship it. And I do have to say that the print version turned out incredibly cool. My copy isn't here yet (\*shakes fist at mail system*) but [imagine this](https://i.imgur.com/DYZK4MG.jpg) wrapped around a physical book.

Thank you guys for existing. This is such a lovely, supportive, and talented community, and my little book wouldn't exist without you all. <3

Here's a peek at the first chapter of the book!
***
Eris walked home with her eyes turned down, like she always did.

After twenty long years of life, she still couldn’t get used to the stares. Everywhere she went, it seemed strangers stared at her until she raised her eyes to theirs, and then they looked away again.

She learned to make herself small. Hid behind beanies and headphones and huge coats. But nothing could hide the emptiness over her head.

That was strange. Irredeemably. Unrepeatably. Where you could tell anyone else’s name and basic physical statistics at a glance, Eris had nothing. She grew up staring at her peers and the magical little boxes of lights hovering over their heads. Became quickly used to the question, “Where are your stats? Are you from somewhere faraway?”

And she would answer, “I’m from here,” exasperated, embarrassed. The cryptic talk baffled her. Her strangeness walled her in on all sides, blocked her off in a way from everybody. Even her own family looked at her as if she was not fully one of them.

These days, Eris spoke little. She walked to work where she washed dishes alone in a dark room. Walked home again. She was alone, which she liked, because no one stared at the space over her head in disdain or confusion.

She had taken to walking home with music blaring in her ears, her eyes trained on the road. It was easier to ignore the things people said than to try to forget them later.

It was a little lucky, in retrospect.

She never would have heard him if she did not pause to change the song right then. But then beyond her headphones she heard someone speak. She turned her head and yanked her earphones down.

A homeless man, his face worn by exhaustion and time, sat on a dusty sleeping bag. His stare rooted her to the spot; his eyes were bluer than any she had ever seen. He had hung a piece of tarp over his nest like a roof. Before him sat a tin cup with a couple of one dollar bills.

Eris’s dark eyes went wide and dewy with shock. “I’m sorry,” she said. “What did you say?”

“I said,” the man said, with a tone of lazy surprise, “you’re real, too.”

She stopped, rooted to the spot. Stared at him directly now.

Just like her, there was no box hovering over his head. He simply sat on the pavement. Existing. Unobtrusive as some piece of the background.

“You don’t have a stats bar,” she murmured.

“Am I your first one?” His tone was bitter but delighted. “Sit down, pretty girl. Talk with me for a minute. No one ever talks to me anymore.”

She sat on the concrete beside him. Breathed through her mouth, discretely. “What do you mean I’m real?”

“Those other people—” he gestured to the city beyond, the cars whisking past them in a constant ebb and flow “—are not real. You and I are.” He smiled, dreamily, his eyes somewhere distant and faraway. “There were more of us, when I was young. I’ve heard they’ve begun to dismantle the whole thing.”

Eris could only stare at him. Wondering if he was mentally ill. If she was an idiot for sitting here listening to him ramble.

But he did not sound ill. He sounded very tired, and very sane.

“What’s your name?” she asked him.

“Cassius.” His stare probed her face for something. She was not sure what to offer him. “You must be one of the controls.”

“I honestly don’t know what you’re talking about.”

That made him start laughing in real joy and delight. He stood up and began gathering up his things. Placed them in a torn but serviceable trash bag.

“You can buy me a coffee,” he told Eris, cheerily. “And I will explain everything.”

She gripped her headphones, tightly. Panic chased itself in circles in her belly like a dog after its own tail.

Finally she managed, dizzily, “Okay, then.”

To repeat what the title said, (and get the full prompt, since it wouldn’t quite fit), two years ago I responded to this prompt:

\[WP\] [You're a powerful dragon that lived next to a small kingdom. For centuries you ignored humanity and lived alone in a cave, and the humans also avoided you. As the kingdom fell to invaders, a dying soldier approaches you with the infant princess, begging you to take care of her](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/813gcd/wp_youre_a_powerful_dragon_that_lived_next_to_a/)

Well, I took that idea and decided the “invaders” weren’t of the “Across the mountain” kind and instead were the “from another world time,” and thus was born The Dragon’s Scion, a trilogy of books dealing with the the dragon-raised and empowered princess’s war against the alien invaders. Book one, *Dragonflame,* is out now, with more to follow in the coming months! Read the blurb below!

\---

**Tythel thought growing up under the wings of the last dragon, Karjon the Magnificent, would be the most unusual part of her life. It was only the beginning.**

Finally, she’s come of age to begin her transformation into a half dragon. But just as the ritual completes, a steel ship bursts from the clouds, killing the dragon and tearing her world asunder.

The attack leaves Tythel alone and on the run from the alien invaders. The same ones that conquered her world and killed her parents sixteen years ago. The rightful heir to the throne and the last draconic being, Tythel must use every tool at her disposal to survive and teach the aliens a lesson forged in flame.

They should have let sleeping dragons lie.

*Dragonflame is an epic science-fantasy adventure.*

***FAQ***

**Audiobook/Print Copy?**

Print Copy is coming soon. For audiobook, nothing yet announced, but I’ll update if there is one!

**Is this science fiction or fantasy?**

Both, but in a different direction. Most science fantasy deals with science fiction tech and space wizards, and while I love me my space wizards, this goes the other way - the technology is powered by magic, the aliens use their own magic that isn’t just Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and the entire story takes place on a single fantasy world that the aliens invaded.

**Length?**

*Dragonflame* clocks in at just about 95k words, which makes it about 300 pages in print.

**Elves and Dwarves?**

Not exactly. There are the Sylvani and the Underfolk. Sylvani are woods-dwelling people, but they also have the ability to alter their skin appearance and texture and have mysterious origins, and the Underfolk don’t appear in book 1 but will in book 2, and they share “lives underground” with dwarves but take it in a vastly different direction.

**I read this on your subreddit, what’s different?**

In addition to a completely new introduction/prologue, I’ve applied many of the lessons I’ve learned writing Dragon’s Scion and other books over the last two years, and the prose is cleaner and better fleshed out, as well as some minor changes to fix early installment weirdness.

**Age range?**

The Dragon’s Scion deals with mature themes and has some racy jokes, but also has no real-world swears, no sex, and injuries are not described in overly-graphic detail. It’s PG-13 in movie land, and acceptable for ages 14+.

**Sequels?**

This book is part of a trilogy, and I'm looking to have book 2 - *Ghostflame -* out in mid Feb, early march.

**Purge the xeno!**

Not a question and not quite the right tone, but I like the enthusiasm. You can pick it up here!

# Prologue

On the path between a dying city and a mountain, a dying guardsman rode with a precious bundle in his arms. This was not the first horse the guardsman had ridden since leaving the city. The others had perished on the journey. He hadn’t even purchased this horse. Having long ago discarded his tabard and armor, this guardsman wore thick furs to keep out the bitter cold. Between that and the wild look in his eyes, he looked less like a guardsman and more like a bandit. It was fitting, in a way, that the third and final horse he rode was stolen.

His name was Comber, and he had been part of the troop assigned to protect the royal family against all threats. For ten years he had stood his post, alongside the royal family’s Umbrists. Comber didn’t have the Shadow-infused powers of the Umbrist. He had armor that had been forged with steel mixed with light, and a sword that had been blessed millennia ago with a dragon’s breath.

That was in the past.

He had a vow to protect the royal family against any and all threats. He’d fought when the minions of a necromancer had snuck in through the sewers. He still had a scar on his thigh from an assassin’s crossbow bolt meant for the King. He was not a coward, and he had thought himself beyond fear.

That was also in the past.

Comber looked over his shoulder. His pursuers weren’t there. He was alone here. There was nothing but a path through the woods, a path that had been cleared by game hunters who would head this way. It took a bold man to hunt in these woods, given what guarded them. The same being that drew Comber deeper within. His last hope for salvation.

The skies darkened, and Comber risked a glance upwards. There it was. That hole in the sky. The sun had passed behind it, casting a momentary shadow across the world. It was like the eclipse Comber remembered from when he was a child, but there was still light coming from the center. Small points showing stars unlike any he had seen before.

A few tiny dots broke off from the main circle. Comber shuddered at the sight. He’d seen what those dots could do when they got lower.

The bundle in his arms stirred when he shivered again, and looked up at him with bright green eyes. Awake now, the child’s face was placid for just a moment, those beautiful eyes flickering about. Then hunger set in, and the child started to wail.

“Shhh, little one,” Comber whispered, stroking the side of the child’s face. “Shhh.”

Still the child cried. She was just old enough to eat mashed food. Comber grimaced and looked around again. There was no one present. “Shhh,” Comber said, pulling on the reins of the horse. He reached into his pack. He still had some berries from the last town, and got to work mashing them into a paste with a mortar and pestle. At her age, the child had just enough understanding of what that smell and sound meant, and her cries turned to excited cooing as she reached towards his hands. “Almost there, little one,” Comber said. Or at least, he started to say. Halfway through the wound in his side reminded him of why he’d abandoned his sword, and Comber hissed in pain. Even the simple motion of grinding berries was too much for him.

He set the mortar down carefully. He hadn’t been able to get a spoon in his mad flight. The child was able to suckle the paste off his finger, and that would have to be good enough. Once she’d been fed, Comber held her with one hand and pulled the other inside his coat. He ran his fingers over the hasty bandage. It was damp. He wanted to look at the injury, but didn’t dare. He knew what he’d find. Black veins sprawling outwards from under the bandage, creeping along his skin. Last night, the veins had been halfway to his chest. Soon they would reach his heart.

He’d die then. Comber didn’t need to be a Physician to know that.

The child reached up and grabbed for his nose with hands wrapped in mittens. Comber let her grab it, then pressed his forehead to hers. “Soon, you’ll be safe,” Comber whispered to her.

Then it was time to transition the child to the straps wrapped around his chest, freeing his hands, and Comber resumed his ride to the mountain.

\*\*\*

The horse - Comber had never bothered giving it a name - came to a stop, and the jolt rocked Comber awake. He blinked around blearily. He’d fallen asleep in the saddle somehow. Everything felt like it had been coated in a layer of wool. Comber worked one of his hands free of the glove and pressed it against his forehead. In spite of the cold, heat radiated from the touch. “Fever,” he muttered to the child.

“Bah-bah-bah-bah,” she said, which Comber took as affirmation. He smiled down at her, then looked around again. They’d reached the mountain.

“We go no further together,” he said to the horse. Comber had never been one to speak to his mounts, aside from commands. He preferred to make noises at them, reassuring ones. But in the grip of fever, Comber felt irrationally sorry for abandoning an animal he’d only had for a day. A stolen one, at that. “You’ll be able to find your way back to town, won’t you? Or maybe you’ll be able to run free now, without the need...the need…” Comber trailed off. What had he been doing? Talking to a horse, that’s what.

They were close to the base of the mountain, but not quite there. He could see it. Perhaps he could ride the horse a little bit further? He dug his heels in. The horse let out a huff of air and shook its head, instead backing up a few paces. “Of course,” Comber said, shaking his head. “Of course. A horse. A horse of course.” He laughed a bit. It wasn’t funny, but the child joined in the laughter. He patted the side of the horse’s neck again. “You smell it, don’t you?”

The horse shook its head violently and took another step back. That was all the confirmation Comber needed. The horse would go no further. “You know,” Comber said, getting ready to dismount. “I should have known. They eat you, don’t they?”

The horse did not respond this time, for it was a horse, and all it cared about was that it didn’t need to go any further.

Comber got one foot out of the stirrup, but the world started to spin. Instead of dismounting gracefully, Comber swung drunkenly, and collapsed into the snow. He had just enough presence of mind to turn around as he fell, landing on his back to keep the child safe. Comber growled in pain as the impact lanced through his back. The shock did wonders for clearing his head. The child, jostled by the fall, poked her head up and giggled.

“That’s right,” Comber grunted. “I’m silly, aren’t I?”

The child reached up for him, grasping for him. Comber put his finger out for her to hold onto.

He’d abandoned his station, and he knew he should feel guilty about that, but…the beings that had come from that hole in the sky were beyond anything that could be fought. Arrows bounced off their gleaming carapace. Swords were deflected with swipes from their unnatural hands. He had a duty, and he could only save one person.

He’d chosen her.

Comber rose to his feet and turned the horse around. It only took a nudge to get the horse trotting away from the mountain.

It would live. The child would live. That would have to be enough.

Comber made himself walk towards the mountain. Every footstep was like lead. He spotted a trail in the snow - someone else had come this way and left. They were human, or at least walked like one. It could be an Underfolk or Sylvani. It wasn’t the invaders. That much was certain. No one could mistake their skittering legs for human footsteps.

The mountain, at least, was free of snow. Impossibly free, and impossibly warm. A fire burned in the heart of this mountain. Not the molten fire of a volcano. A living flame. A hungering flame.

Had the fever started sooner than Comber realized? He’d been so certain of this plan. He’d heard tales of the flame that lived in this mountain. The tales had made it out to be one of the ones that did not feast on the flesh of Man or the other Intelligent Races. They said it had stood alongside the forces of the Light and Shadow against dread powers in the past. They said it was not to be disturbed, but would not slay - except for those that came to attack it.

But still...could he trust it?

It was too late now. There was nowhere else he was certain would be safe for the child. Not with that locket, secured carefully in a pouch in the swaddling. Even without it...would anywhere be safe from the invaders? Would anything? They hadn’t been killing innocents. They’d killed armies, they’d slaughtered guards, but any who did not pick up blade or spear against them was spared their wrath. Yet...Comber didn’t trust them to stop there. It was possible - nay, it seemed likely - that they were just starting with those that posed a threat to them.

“Not that we did,” he said to the child, who paused in her attempts to gum his finger to look up at him. “I hope, if you remember nothing else, you remember that we tried. We tried.”

“Burrrbl,” the child said happily.

“We tried,” Comber repeated. And they had. Nicandros, the captain of the royal guard, had commanded them perfectly. However, no strategy could overcome the fact that their weapons did no harm to the invaders. That was when Comber realized the only option was saving what he could. That there would be no victory here. Still, Comber had fought, until his wound. Then...he’d been even more useless in battle.

Time became unstable. Comber kept walking up the warm mountain and its bare stones. It was a gentle slope, which was the only reason he could progress at all. Ahead, he saw his goal.

A hole, high up the mountain. One far larger than would be needed for a man to pass through, and one too smooth and round to be the result of nature. This was not a cave. It was a lair.

Comber stumbled and dropped to his knees. The child started to wail again, startled by the jostling. Comber tried to shush its cries, but he was too late. Something was stirring in the lair, dragging itself forth from the depths. Comber saw golden eyes peering out of the darkness, followed by red scales and immense, bat-like wings.

Comber had never seen a dragon in person. Only flying overhead, and even then, such sights were rare. He’d expected them to crawl across a ground, like a lizard, but this one slunk with a cat’s grace. An older cat, one that was past its prime hunting days, but still possessing enough energy to move about. The dragon flapped its wings and took to the air, circling around Comber once before landing.

“I told Lathariel I would not be disturbed,” the dragon growled, and Comber was certain he’d made a mistake. Tears started to form in his eyes, unbidden.

“Please…” Comber said, but the dragon shook its head.

“I will not fight.” The dragon looked up, seeing the hole in the sky, and its nostrils flared. For a moment, Comber could see it considering...then it shook its head again. “I will not fight,” it repeated. “Leave this threat for younger drakes. Ones that have hotter flames.”

“Please…” Comber said again, then coughed. Flecks of something black came with the cough, and Comber moved with speed he didn’t know he still had, pulling the child free of the path of whatever those were. He groaned in pain and nearly blacked out.

“You are injured,” the dragon said, leaning down. “And you are ill.”

Comber nodded.

“I can heal your injuries,” the dragon said, after considering for a moment. “But my flames will make the disease spread quicker.”

“Not...me.” Comber coughed again. “Her.”

The dragon looked at the child. “She’s uninjured,” he said.

“Care...protect.” Comber’s vision grew dark. “She...she...is.” Comber’s vision narrowed. “She is...everything....” The dragon was barely visible now. The world was barely visible. The child stirred, looking from the dragon to Comber and back again, starting to make distressed noises. She didn’t fear the dragon. That was good. But she could tell something was wrong.

“I’m sorry,” Comber said to the child. He looked back up at the dragon. His vision was barely there anymore. He’d gone so far. It felt like part of his mind had been set on fire, to hold back death, and now that he was here, that flame had gone out. “Tell her…” Comber said, and then he started to cough again. “She is…”

“What should I tell her she is?” the dragon asked, after Comber had been silent for too long. When he got no response, the dragon Karjon leaned down. The man’s heartbeat had been so faint when he’d approached, Karjon could barely hear it. Now, though? Now there was nothing.

And the child started to cry.

Karjon looked at it. He’d never dealt with human children before. He knew they needed more comfort than hatchlings. Uncertain, Karjon reached out with one claw and retracted his talon, then brushed his scales on the child’s cheek.

Quick as a viper, the child grabbed Karjon’s finger tightly, trying to seek some comfort in a world that had abandoned her.

Karjon sighed. He had not had children of his own. He hadn’t planned on doing so. But...if nothing else, he could not leave this child to starve on his mountain. He carefully bit on the swaddling, making certain to only let his fangs touch the fabric.

Once these invaders had been dealt with, Karjon would take the child to the nearest humans. They would know how to handle her. He’d keep her safe until then. It shouldn’t be long. There had been many threats over his nine hundred years of life. They’d always been defeated.

There was no reason to believe this would be any different.

# Chapter 1

“I have lived for centuries,” Karjon growled. “I dueled the Necromancer Gix and his army of undead. I was on the Council of Twelve, battling the Lichborne. When the mad Lumcaster sought to blind the world, I doused him in my flames. How is it that nothing has vexed me as much as you, little one?”

Tythel looked up at the dragon with eyes wide in feigned innocence. Sixteen years had passed since the mountain and the snow. She didn’t remember it, of course. Just as she did not remember what her name had been before coming here. Tythel was a dragon’s name, not a human name. For all Karjon’s bluster, she was not worried. In sixteen years, Karjon had never raised a claw in anger. “Father, have you considered that it is just because you love me so dearly?”

Karjon huffed and shook his head. “That cannot be it. I think it *must* be because I did not know how *vexing* your unique subspecies of humans can be.”

“Subspecies?” Tythel asked.

“Yes. Those strange beings humans call ‘adolescents.’ Or perhaps it is just a trait unique to daughters.”

Tythel beamed at him. The expression only came through with her eyes. In her books, humans would use their mouths to do things like smile and frown. Tythel understood, in theory, what those were, but the expressions didn’t come to her naturally. From what Karjon had said, she’d smiled and frowned at first...but with time, those had stopped. Now, she blinked rapidly to show her excitement. “Which would only matter because you love me. Therefore, I am still correct. And, since I *am* correct, I see no reason I should not be allowed to go.”

Karjon sighed heavily. “Tythel…”

“You said I could,” Tythel reminded him, trying her best not to sound sullen.

“I told you that, yes,” Karjon said. “I said you could go when it was safe.”

“I want to see other humans,” Tythel said. “Why can’t I go?”

Karjon sighed again, a sound that filled the entire cave that was his lair and their home. “When, exactly, did ‘because I said so’ become insufficient?”

“When I stopped being a child,” Tythel said. “You said when I was sixteen, I could go and see other humans.”

“I said that you could go into the village when you were sixteen, Tythel. I did not say you could do so the very next day.” Making that promise, back when she was nine, had been a mistake. He’d done it to get her to cease her incessant questions. He didn’t think humans of that age could *remember* things for so long.

“You’re splitting scales and you know it.” She folded her arms across her chest and glowered at him.

Karjon, who weighed in at just over six tons and had battled some of the greatest foes the world had ever seen, broke the staring contest first. Tythel tried not to blink when she realized that meant she was getting through to him. For all his fury and might, Karjon had always struggled to deny her anything. Still, he was not caving like he usually did. “Tythel, there are reasons for the choices I make. They are for your safety.”

“You always hide behind that, father. Are you planning on keeping me here the rest of my life? What are you hiding me *from?*”

“There are those out there that would see you dead. Is that not enough explanation?”

She glowered at him again. “You know I can’t do anything if you don’t tell me. But if you want me to leave it alone, you’ll need to give me more than that.” Her expression softened. “Please, father.”

Karjon settled down onto the pile of coins that made his seat. Tythel took the cue and walked over to her own, smaller pile. She didn’t have a hoard of her own. Not yet. But she would one day, although she was less than eager for that day. Dragons did not share a hoard. She’d have to leave that day, never to live here again.

“Perhaps…” Karjon started to say, then held up a claw to forestall her before she got too excited. “It is time you know of the dangers beyond this lair. Why I keep you hidden here. And tomorrow…” he studied her critically for a moment, then nodded. “You are old enough.”

“To go visit?” Tythel asked hopefully.

“Not yet,” Karjon said, shaking his head. “But tomorrow, I think you are ready for the one thing I know you want more than to leave.”

Tythel sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “You mean...you’ll finish the adoption?”

Karjon nodded, and Tythel leapt up to run over and wrap her arms around her father’s neck. “Thank you thank you thank you!” There were tears forming in her eyes, a human reaction she hadn’t shed with age, but these were tears of joy and not sadness.

“It’s past time,” Karjon said. “I just worried about how your body would react to the transformation.”

“I know,” Tythel said, although deep in her heart, she’d worried that he wouldn’t do it. That she wasn’t good enough. She’d never told Karjon that. If it wasn’t true, it would have broken his heart. If it was true...she couldn’t have handled that. Now, though, she was practically vibrating with anticipation.

Karjon put one of his claws around her, in his version of a hug. From what he’d said, dragons did not engage in touch the way humans did, but one of his books had told him a lack of touch and affection could kill human infants. Deep down, Tythel suspected he had grown to like it himself. “Now. Will you listen, and will you wait?”

Tythel nodded firmly.

“Then do so,” Karjon said, and Tythel settled back onto her coins. “Sixteen years ago, just days before you were brought to me...the skies let loose monsters.”

“Monsters?” Tythel asked.

Karjon nodded. “I do not know if they have a name. I know what Lathariel told me they were being called ‘Those From Above.’ They had weapons that sucked in light and spewed forth their own unnatural energy. Unlight, she called it.”

“And you fought them?” Tythel asked, excitedly.

Karjon shook his head, and in his eyes Tythel could see sorrow she’d never imagined from her father. “I am old,” Karjon said. “I thought they could be defeated without me. Even when I was told dragonflame was all that would harm them...I still thought they could be defeated. There were other dragons. By the time I realized...it was too late. Those From Above had secured power over humanity. They rule down there now. As far as I know, they only fear dragonflame.”

Tythel held up a hand and focused. A ball of flame formed between her fingers. “They fear this?” she asked. Dragonflame was similar to normal fire, but more vibrant. The transition from white to yellow to orange to red that happened in a normal flame was marked by clearer lines. Hers was weak. Not close to the true power of a dragon. She could barely call upon it, and couldn’t even touch the greater fires of ghostflame or heartflame. But it was not nothing.

“Yes,” Karjon said, and there was a somber note to his voice that Tythel couldn’t ignore. “By healing you when you injured yourself...you already formed the gift.  They will hunt you. For that and...for other reasons.”

“What other reasons?”

Karjon shook his head. “Not yet. There is much I have kept from you. You are old enough now, but...before that there’s something you need to understand.” He put one claw carefully on her knee. “Tythel...tomorrow, after the Ascension, the number of dragons in the world will go from one to two.”

Tythel stared at her father for a long moment, processing his words. She’d never met another dragon, but the idea there had been other dragons out there...she’d just assumed it. Realizing they’d been hunted down, there was only one thing to do.

She hugged Karjon again, and her father hugged her back. They sat there for a moment, before both of them could steady themselves enough to speak. “Tythel,” Karjon said. “I…have kept something else from you.”

“It’s so much,” Tythel whispered.

Karjon cocked his head. “Do you need time before the rest?”

Tythel considered for a moment, then shook her head. “A scholar’s first duty is to acquire all information before passing judgement,” Tythel said, repeating one of her father’s lessons back to him.

Karjon gave her a slow blink of amusement. “You listen too well sometimes. Very well. Your locket.”

Tythel’s hands went up to the chain around her neck. She’d worn it as long as she could remember. It was the one piece of her own hoard she had.  “You said it was my parents.”

Karjon nodded. “That locket is the other reason you will be hunted. It is the locket of the royal family.”

There was a moment of silence as Tythel stared at her father. “The…the royal family. But they…I mean…that’s…” Tythel sputtered off into silence. She couldn’t say it. “I’m…”

Karjon nodded, the motion oddly gentle. “You are the heir to the throne of your family. The throne of the kingdom of Dretayne. You are the next queen of this realm. And for that, you will be hunted as one of the barriers to the rule of Those from Above.”

Tythel took a deep, ragged breath, then nodded slowly. She couldn’t think about it right now. She could barely understand it. So she fell back on the lessons of her childhood. A scholar's first duty. “Tell me everything.”

\*\*\*

Tythel did not sleep well that night. She tried to, doing every meditation technique Karjon had taught her over the years, but she spent the entire night tossing and turning. The bed she slept on was one Karjon had gotten as a trophy from the Underfolk, those strange underground folk that were in Karjon’s stories, and it had been perfect for her when she was a child. But for the last two years, she’d been forced to scrunch up on it, leading to the impression the Underfolk were likely quite small.

In truth, Tythel was taller than most humans. Sixteen years of eating a diet of meat cooked in dragonflame and lifting and moving gold on a regular basis had left her with a build that was less princess and more warrior, but since the only humans she’d seen had been in her imagination, she’d had no idea how imposing a figure she could cut when she wasn’t comparing herself to a dragon.

She’d never complained to Karjon about the small bed. Other things, sure, but never that – or any of the other things he’d provided to her over the years. Tythel had known how lucky she’d been to have a dragon for a father. Karjon’s stories were full of tales of the legendary heroes of the past, Calcon the Brave and Rilan the Just and Brigith the Nobel and all the rest of them. All of them had started their lives as humble folk that had heeded the Call, which meant their lives had been the humdrum work of farmers and blacksmiths and other folk, and the stories all made that life out to be terribly dull.

She’d always imagined Karjon had rescued her from that sort of suffering.

Now she knew differently. She would have been a princess, daughter to a king and queen, living a life of luxury and wealth and, if the legends were any indication, would have either ended up spoiled rotten or kidnapped by someone to later be rescued. Other than that her life would have been one of formality and circumstance until she was married off to secure an alliance or to whoever had been strong enough to save her, regardless of their other qualities.

Tythel decided that, small bed aside, she still felt lucky to have been raised by Karjon. That feeling was quickly followed by shame at even considering an alternative.

She got out of bed and pulled her blankets and pillows to the floor, arranging them in a pile like the gold Karjon slept on. It wasn’t as comfortable as the bed, but it did allow her to stretch out, and that was preferable to being cramped into the bed at the moment.

The problem was, it wasn’t the bed keeping her up tonight. It was her mind.

Tythel had been on top of the mountain a few times every year, under Karjon’s careful eye. He had explained that if she didn’t get to see the sky every now and then, she’d probably go mad. The village had always fascinated her, and her entire life she’d wanted to go there, just for a day, to explore and celebrate. She wanted to see horses and soldiers and blacksmiths and maybe even a lumcaster if she was really lucky. Karjon had taught her some magic, the barest flicker of dragonflame, but it was not magic meant for humans.

Of course, that would change tomorrow. Well, her being human – she didn’t know if she’d gain any proficiency with her meager powers in the process. She’d have Karjon’s power running through her veins, becoming half dragon and half human. For most of her life, it had been the one thing she’d wanted more than going to the village.

*The village.* She turned over again.

From the mountain, it had been hard to make out details. She’d filled in those details in her head with ones stolen from her stories – thatched roofs covering star-crossed lovers, barns harboring hard working folk with wisdom gained from years of honest toil, scholars in cramped quarters trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, chimneys smoking with fires that were roasting chickens or beef. Never in her life had she imagined the people out there were being subjected to tyrants that had more power than she could imagine. Never, not once, had she imagined that she was their ruler by a mere quirk of birth.

That thought got her turning again. Karjon’s stories had talked about something called “noblesse oblige,” the responsibilities that the nobility had to their people. Protect them, help them, guide them, and care for them. If she was a noble – a royal – didn’t the same thing apply to her?

*Stop it, Tythel. Stop it.*

But the thought wouldn’t go away. If she stayed here with Karjon, she was failing in her responsibility. The sixteen years leading up to this had not been her fault; she hadn’t known she had duties. After a moment of reflection, she decided they weren’t Karjon’s fault either. They were the fault of the mysterious Those from Above. Now that she knew, however…well, Karjon had always taught her that inaction was still a choice, the choice to do nothing.

Tomorrow, then, after the Ritual. She’d leave, no matter what. And if Karjon tried to stop her…well, then she’d have to do it alone.

And that thought, more than any other, caused Tythel to burrow as deeply as she could into the blankets before sleep finally claimed her.

[In the post apocalyptic wasteland ""genies"" are actually still functioning AI's that provide their ""masters"" advanced knowledge. You've just unearthed one while scavenging.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5sewpn/wp_in_the_post_apocalyptic_wasteland_genies_are/)

It wasn't an insanely upvoted prompt, but for whatever reason the setting really stuck with me for months. And after waiting a while to start seeing the missing pieces, I decided to expand it into a much wider story. The original premise remains in the final product, but I would say I ended up writing a far different story than the one I was expecting to write. 

The books stand at approximately 65,000 words, 73,000 words, and 75,000 words in length. The original prompt response is now the second chapter of *Watch Them Wander,* and is slightly modified in the final version. 

I commissioned professionally illustrated covers for all three books that show them clearly in series, and I really love the way they turned out. It's a bit spoilery to see the totality of the covers beside each other but if you want to check them out [the whole set can be seen here in paperback](https://imgur.com/a/YiyMDiR).


**Chapter 1 can be read right here** 


**~1~**


Samantha snapped out of her mindless delirium, as she rode her camel through the infinity that was her desert hell. 


“Is this the right way?” whispered Samantha, to the compass in her palm. The sun shredded the skin around her eyes. She clothed every part of her body from the light, but she still needed an opening to see. She was so numb to the burn that it hardly felt like more than a light tan anymore. “Do I recognize this place?” 


Every path through the sand looked the same to an unfamiliar eye. But Samantha knew every dune, every stray cactus, every mountain and every abandoned tent, along the familiar paths she’d taken throughout her solitary life. 


And more than anything else, Samantha knew when she was lost. 


“Goddamnit Samantha focus,” she whispered, as her eyes blurred and foreshadowed a faint. She shook her head of it, and willed herself awake. Nothing could be closer to a death sentence than fainting in the heat of the wilderness. Venturing out for the few scraps of rattlesnake food she found felt like a much better idea in the coolness of the morning. 


She took a final swig of what drops remained of her water, and weakly hit her leather flask till no drops remained. Samantha’s head bobbed with every step the camel made, until she noticed something reflecting the sun’s light in the distance. Samantha stared at it with zombie eyes as she stopped beside it and took her time dropping from her camel. She brushed the sand away from the metal with her gloved hands, and paused a moment when she saw the golden spout peaking out from the sand. 


Samantha suddenly felt her heart beat a little faster. 


“*No,*” whispered Samantha. She thought she’d harvested every piece of scrap metal within a five mile radius, and it always burned like hell even through her gloves when she picked it up. Samantha caressed the metal for a moment like it was precious. She pulled the glove from her hand, and set her fingertips to the lamp. 


It was disturbingly cool to the touch.


A few breaths later, Samantha felt the shivering of the lamp in her hands, and felt her mind burst awake to attention. 


And a gecko no longer than her hand crept ever so gently out of the sand, to capture the moment with its glassy eyes. 


There was a faint whistling sound, like boiling water in a pot, before the noise of internal gears and what past generations would recognize as the sound of a computer hard drive’s read heads moving rapidly back and forth, before the rougher sound of gears once more. 


Samantha’s eyes snapped open, as the lamp in her hands shook a little bit, and made a noise that was unmistakable for one clearing their throat before speaking. 


*""Hello there,”* said the lamp in Samantha’s shaking hands. *“My name is Adam.""*

On top of all of that I can't say how much I enjoy being a part of this writing community, both reading and writing. WritingPrompts was the first subreddit I was ever exposed to with regards to Reddit, and so for that reason among many others it holds a special place in my heart. There are so many talented authors writing on here any given day, and it's great reading so many fresh approaches to the same core plots from different minds. Hopefully my meager contributions have helped enrich the Reddit experience for others, as all the writers on here have enriched the Reddit experience for me. And hopefully I can continue to entertain you all more in the future through this series. 

All the best,

**Here's chapter 1, which was the original response:**

The asteroid was called the Hand of God when it hit. 

Not that we know much about God, of course. There are plenty of books that survived the destruction, though the readers far more sparse. And those that could spouted nonsense after a few pages, about things called Suns and moons being created, about talking beings called ""animals"", about oceans. About legends of old, myths, wishful thinking. But what I do know about God is, if his hand caused the damage to the ship, I don't want to know much more. 

The stories say that the ship used to be one before it hit. That the asteroid split the ship right down the center, making the way to the other side dangerous, impossible. But we can still see it, entangled in cord and moving alongside us, and we can see in their windows. We can see the faces far more gaunt than our own, the cheeks near bone, the eyes hollow and staring hungrily back at us. And we can see them fighting, using knives stashed from the kitchen along with strange flashing devices, and though we cannot hear we know they scream. 

There is a third part of the ship as well, this one with no faces in the windows, all dark and barely held to the main two parts. But no one has ever seen movement there, and it is far smaller than the halves. 

There are one thousand of us on our side, a census conducted each year by scratching marks into the cold wall, making sure we have enough to eat. Any number over eleven hundred has led to shortages of food, and more importantly, water. As one of the gardeners, I know this too well, planning out the ship's rations and crops, utilizing the few rooms remaining with glowing ceilings. Deciding if I plant only those seeds specified for meals, or if we could splurge on space for the herbs demanded by our doctors or the spices requested by our cooks. 

We worked together on the ship, each of us with our task for survival, none of us expendable. At ten a child was assigned their task, from chief to scourer, based upon the skills they possessed. Every year they were reevaluated, deciding if a change was neccessary, and for the past three I had been applying for the coveted historian. For keeping the tales and the knowledge from long before, from where the recovered books on ship census marked twenty five thousand. 

In the stories of old, it is said that God could speak even if he couldn't be seen. That he could be heard as a voice alone, sending commandments down to his people. 

And today, of the year 984, I, Horatius, heard him. 

""Systems rebooting,"" said the voice, jolting me out of my duties watering the plants, ""ship damage assessed. Reuniting the two halves of the ship and restoring airlock, approximately twenty four hours until complete.""

Staring out the window, I saw the cables holding the halves of the ships tighten. I saw the eyes of the hungry faces widen as they were dragged closer. 

And I wondered if the hand of God was striking again.

But they are feared.

The power first demonstrates itself on the full moon closest to the winter solstice- when the lunar arc across the sky reaches its greatest potential.  It is on that night that the doors are locked, the shutters boarded tight, and the candles burning through until dawn.  When an extra box of ammunition is kept close, the handguns loaded, and the sights on the darkness beyond the home walls.  For that is the night of the Great Wering- and for the majority, the most dangerous night of the year.

My parents were architects, and since I was young, they fostered that intrigue in me as well. My childhood toybox was filled with building blocks as legos lined my shelves.  One of my earliest memories was of a Minor Wering, a standard full moon, when my parents sealed both my nanny and me deep into the cellar.  They would be watching above, as an initial line of defence, and even at that young age I’d seen my father’s shotgun over the mantle.  Outside, the screams, shrieks, and howls kept me from sleep- and as my nanny shook in her cot, her hands over her ears, I found solace in creating.  In building the night away, the structures of my makeshift block city muffling the sounds of terror from above.  In that city, I was safe- and nothing from the outside world intrude.

That’s not to say *all* the Were were malicious- in fact, perhaps only half of them were.  For every werewolf there was a werefairy, for every werebear a weretree.  Even among the beasts, not all craved destruction, for the temperament of a Were was simply that of a person amplified.  It was all that which was typically filtered out by the human mind, the emotions never allowed to surface, whether they be good or bad.

But under the surface, many in this world are angry.

My parents continued to lock me into the cellar every month, even as I entered my teens.  When I emerged the next morning, it was as if a hurricane had struck our town.  Telephone poles were smashed in half, house windows shattered, deep gouges ran down the street.  But there was good, too- golden coins left behind by the wereleprechauns for anyone to find in the street, traces of werepixie dust said to cure the most malignant diseases, and bounties of fruits of unknown varieties from weretrees in harvest.  Rushing out those mornings was like a mix of Christmas and Nightmare- never knowing who might have been targeted, but also never knowing what you might find.  And that was only the Minor Werings- on Great Werings were the best treasures found.

As I grew older, I found myself both curious, and ardent upon taking the responsibility of my father to guard the house. An innate desire to protect, to keep my family safe.

“I’m fourteen,”  I complained to him as he shut the cellar door atop me, locking me in, “I’m ready to help!  What if something happens to you?  Something like the Wilkensons?”

The Wilkensons had lived up the street, and my father had shaken his head at their foolishness when a new red sports car occupied their driveway.  Mr. Wilkenson had recently achieved a promotion, and had flaunted the money- but unlike the truly rich, could not afford the protection they hired every Wering.  Guards were not cheap, as they were often powerful among the Were themselves, and on high demand on the nights of the full moon.  

The risk should have been small- after all, there were bigger targets than our neighborhood.  But when a werebear smells honey, he doesn’t stop until he finds it- and their house was torn apart timber by timber.  The Wilkenson’s were never found- and I never expected them to be again.

“I’ve lived this past forty years just fine,”  my father answered, his voice assuring.  “I’ll live another year without trouble.  You stay down there, Muros. No matter what you hear up here, no matter how concerned you are about us, know we’ll be fine.  The best you can do is hide.”

That night I’d sulked, but retreated to the cellar, my ears pricked for the sound of the Were above.  But none came- my parent’s were careful to live frugal, and never to attract the attention of others.  But there were the subtle signs I’d noticed over the years that they had more money than they let on- my father speaking more and more about retirement, the food we bought being all brand name, the maid that cleaned our home.  That, and we always seemed to have cash- my parents stashing a large pile of it behind a painting in their bedroom, one that they didn’t know I had found. 

When I was fifteen, before a Minor Wering I’d examined the lock my father used for the cellar- and carefully, I’d jammed it.  The tumbler still turned to act as if it were locked, but it would pop open without a key, thanks to the wad of paper I’d stuffed into the mechanism.  But that was the year I’d started taking collegiate level classes, and my interest in the Wering faded for some time as I struggled to keep up.  Spending the Were nights in the cellar studying, my attention focused more on books than the howls.

Until the Great Wering of my sixteenth year.

I’d never heard anything upstairs during a Wering before- my parents were cautious to stay quiet, and not once had we attracted attention.  But midnight on this Great Wering was accompanied by the shattering of a window, as my head jolted upwards from my physics book.

*Something* moved upstairs, a rustling as drawers slammed open, and claws raked across tile.  Silently, I crept up the cellar stairs, my ear to the wooden door, waiting for the report of my father’s shotgun.  Surely, it would arrive at any minute- but nothing came, and instead my muscles tensed as the growling grew louder.  

My heart raced- *whatever this was, had it already eaten my parents?*  Were they, too, to disappear like the Wilkensons?

From the cellar, I retrieved a baseball bat, gripping it so tight that my knuckles turned white.  I reached up, jiggling the knob of the cellar door, hearing the faint *click* as the lock I had jammed so long ago came free.  There was an answering hiss, and I grit my teeth- then I barrelled through the wooden door, bat held high over my head, my voice shouting.

“Get away from my parents!”  I shouted, then froze at the hulking form in our kitchen.

There was no blood- nothing that would suggest a fight.  Only the mangled fur of the weregurilla, its humanlike eyes staring down at me with red rage, with more muscles in its bicep than my entire body combined.  Fear seized me then, as I realized my parents must have fled- and the bat dropped with a clatter to the tile.  The weregurilla spoke then, it’s teeth gnashing together as it tried to form words, slowly walking forwards on its knuckles mutated with long claws.

“Your father cheated me,”  the grating words came out.  “And I’ve waited to so dearly repay him.  Your life, I assume, should suffice.”  Then he roared, phlegm and spittle blasting into the room, and my animal instinct took over.  As I turned and ran out the still smashed door into the street, crashing sounding behind me as the weregurrilla approached.

I had one look at the street before the sensation gripped me- there were creatures of all kinds, great and small.  One resembled the hulking form of a dinosaur, grazing in our neighbors yard, while a pack of wild dogs ran yipping about its ankles.  Winged beings filled the air, sparks falling from some in vibrant colors, and roars sounded from just beyond the bend.  But then, my world faded to white, and I knew the guerilla must have struck me down.

Except, it wasn’t white, exactly.  It was silver.  *Lunar* silver.

And in that moment, I was no longer a sixteen year old boy- rather, I was that child in a room full of legos.  Building the perfect structure to keep me safe- with high walls, and an electric fence, and landmines in the front yard.  With windows barred of steel, and a door six inches thick, with a combination like a bank vault. The foundation stretched deeper than the city sewer, and gargoyles lined with rooftop, starin in defiance to those below.

Except I wasn’t *building* the safehouse- rather, I *was* the safehouse.  One so sound that nothing from that street would dare enter.  Even the guerrilla, beating his chest in anger, turned away at my lawn.  That night passed like a dream- in a state not quite human, but that of embodying protection.  

When the sun rose, I was laying in the street, my eyelids fluttering open.  About me was the normal remains of the Wering- but there was something else, two figures crouched above, their faces stricken with fear.  

“Muros,”  my father whispered, as my mother held a hand to her mouth.  “What have you done?”

I struggled to find words, and they poured from me all out of order.

“I had to!  The house was invaded, and I thought something happened to you.  I thought-”
But my father cut me off, a finger to his lips, as my mother spoke.

“You must pack quickly. We do not know who saw you, and our secret is now out.”

“Our secret?”  I asked, and my father continued for her.

“We are Werehouses, son.  The ultimate protection someone can purchase on the Wering.  Every year, we offer our services to the highest bidder to keep them safe.”

“Then why are you so scared?”  I asked, as they pulled me to my feet, and my father threw open the house door.  As he bolted inside, taking down the picture with the cash behind it and throwing it into a bag, my mother answered.

“We protect the most important people on Werenights.  If someone should wish to attack those people, they must go through us - but we have hidden our identities.  For a Werehouse, the safest nights are on the Wering.”  Then she drew a breath, fetching the car keys.  “But the rest of the month is when we are weak, and can be struck down easy.  For us, every other day is like a Wering.  It’s when we know danger.”

“When we are hunted.”

Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/i2t4xy/wp_you_fall_in_love_with_a_girl_and_the_two_of) prompt by /u/zoebug0617.

If our once upon a time began when I first laid eyes on Drachena--D, as I called her--then everything come next should have been our happily ever after.

We held hands beneath the table at my parent's house, giggled like children at each other's jokes. We passed surreptitious winks when we thought nobody watched. We smiled in a spring downpour in a forest as birds chirped and squirrels scampered and her tears of joy mixed with raindrops as she, too, got down on one knee and said yes to me a hundred times.

Happily ever after should have come next. We had no doubts, no qualms about the future, no ifs or buts or reservations.

We bought a house. Settled down. Started talking about having kids, and everything we'd have to do to prepare. It wasn't a matter of ""if""; ""when"" was the only question.

It was summer of that year when it snowed for Easter, when the flowers had begun to bloom just for late frosts to beat them back, and the moisture from melting snow and incessant rain seeped inside due to poor sloping in the cramped caverns below the deck out behind the house.

I donned my best workman's outfit: those old jeans D called ""dad jeans"" and a shirt she'd forbidden me from wearing around the house.

""More hole than shirt,"" she'd called it.

Centipedes scurried. Spiders licked their little fangs at the thought of a human-sized meal. I cleared their webs with one hand and grimaced as others crawled around me and over me.

Something sparkled from the phone flashlight's beam. I crawled closer. More sparkled. Coins. Diamonds. Golden goblets and fine silver. Some were dirtied as if they'd sat there for years. Others not so much.

""What the fuck?"" I muttered to nothing but the spiders and centipedes.

I backed out the way I'd come, didn't bother changing out of my work clothes as I waited for D to get home from work.

She entered cheery as ever, smiling so wide she glowed. Better that than the days where she came home piping mad about something that had happened at work. Mad enough I swore she spouted smoke from her nostrils.

""Is everything alright, dear?"" she asked, looking me up and down. ""Your clothes are all muddy.""

""They are, aren't they? I was underneath the deck checking on the sloping. I think that's why we have water in the basement.""

She turned a slight shade of pale but recovered just as quickly. ""Underneath the deck? No wonder you're muddy. Why don't you go change and--""

""Have you been down there?"" I interrupted.

Her key chain rattled as it hung loose in her hands. She looked at her feet.

""Yes,"" she said finally.

""That's odd. Why? Don't get me wrong, you're as entitled to being down there as I am, I'm just wondering if maybe you saw the pile of treasure there was.""

""Was?"" She stood up straighter, alarmed.

""Is. I didn't touch it.""

D didn't lie. Not that I knew of, at least. But she sure did seem to be treading that thin line between a bold-faced lie and a lie by omission.

""It's mine,"" she admitted in response to my judgmental silence.

""Yours?""

Since we'd met, nothing was ""hers"" or ""mine"" other than toothbrushes and underwear. The cars were ours, the house was ours--even the leftovers in the fridge became a lawless first-come-first-serve that neither of us minded.

""Ours, I guess,"" she said with more than a little reluctance.

""It can be yours,"" I said. ""I just don't quite understand how it got there.""

""It's a long story,"" D said.

I shrugged. It was a Friday night. I had all the time in the world, at least until Monday.

""Might as well get started,"" I said.

D sighed. ""I'm a dragon. That's my hoard. Er, our hoard, I mean.""

I nearly spit out the water I'd sipped. ""A dragon. Right. And I'm a genie, rub my bottle and I'll grant you three wishes. Come on, D. I'm being serious.""

""Me, too.""

""A dragon. Like a lizard person? That's silly, D. It's some nut-job conspiracy theory. We laugh at those people, don't tell me you've become one of them.""

""You laugh at them,"" D said. ""I listen.""

""A dragon. Prove it, I guess. Breathe fire. Fly. I don't know, D. This is nuts.""

She took a deep breath. Widened her beautiful, gray eyes. ""Look at me. Look at my eyes.""

I did. Her irises swirled. The ash gray glowed a faint yellow, then flared like a flaming red. A cloud of smoke poofed from her nose. A guttural growl emerged from deep in her belly, like last night's lasagna come up for its vengeance.

Instead of bile or a vile belch, a flare of fire burst from her mouth. The candle sitting on the kitchen counter flickered to life. The electric bill sitting nearby had its edges singed.

I gawked. She looked at me with those pale-again eyes.

""See? I told you,"" she said, her voice raspier than normal, like a smoker's voice.

I opened my mouth to respond, closed it again, then shook my head. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""You did. Although this really just brings up more questions... I mean, how much haven't you told me? Are your parents dragons? Are they even dead? Have you just not wanted me to meet them? Are you--""

""Yes, yes, no. I'd love for you to meet them, but they really are dead.""

""Not from a home invasion, I imagine. Considering they were dragons, too.""

""Technically a home invasion,"" D said, treading again truth's thin line. ""The cave was their home. And there was an invasion. It just wasn't with guns or anything. There were torches and spears and two dozen knights and my parents died protecting me. I escaped into the mountains.""

""Which mountains, truly?""

""The Austrian Alps. I'm from Austria, like I told you. I really don't like lying to you, babe, I just couldn't come out and say I was a dragon...""

""Well, you could have,"" I argued, but I didn't believe it myself. I hadn't come out on the first date telling her I liked pineapple on my pizza and that I took my cereal with orange juice. People just didn't share those things.

""No, babe. I couldn't have. Nobody dates dragons. People kill them. That's why I took this human form. It was either that or dying like the rest of my kind,"" D said quietly.

I swallowed hard at the dampness that formed in her eyes. It hurt my heart to see her cry, hurt it worse to think of the centuries of pain she must have endured.

""So am I really your first? Or have there been hundreds before me? I've heard dragons live centuries.""

""I told you, babe, I don't like lying to you. You really are my first. I, uh..."" She hung her head. A tear rolled down her cheek, steaming against her warm skin until it disappeared.

I scooted closer, put my hand on her leg for comfort. ""Hey, you can talk to me. We're married. 'Til death do us part, all that. Dragon or not, it won't change my mind. I love you for who you are.""

""I waited to find somebody until I knew I didn't have long left. I didn't want to fall in love, then have my love die, and then have to suffer hundreds more years alone.""

""You don't have long left?"" The breath caught in my throat. It was my turn to pale, my turn to be comforted by her touch.

She put her hand upon mine, let the cool smoothness of her skin calm me. Scaly smoothness? I shuddered, unsure how to feel.

""Don't worry,"" she said. ""I didn't mean it like that. I don't have long left in dragon years. In human years, I'm fine. I'll probably still outlive you by a couple decades.""

""Is that a threat?"" I said, and both our faces broke into smiles at the familiar inside joke. She rolled her eyes at me. I had more questions despite the laughs. ""What does this mean for us, D?""

""What do you mean? We're really rich now that you know about this. I don't like parting with my hoard, but I'd be willing to if it'd help pay off those student loans of yours or the house.""

I raised my eyebrows. Getting those loans off my shoulders would be a massive relief. But the load would just be replaced by knowing my wife was a dragon.

""And the hoard is bigger than just that,"" D said, and she sat up straighter with pride.

""Really? Wow. But like, in the future, can we still have kids?""

""Of course we can, babe. I wouldn't lie to you about that.""

""And they'll be..."" Normal? I didn't say that. It'd break her heart.

""Part dragon,"" D said. ""But they'll fit in just fine. Just like I have. There's just one little catch, and it's more a personal preference.""

""Don't tell me you don't want kids now,"" I said, my voice low and cautious.

""Oh, I do. But I'll need to deliver them here at home.""

""Well, my mom delivers babies for a living so I'm sure that's no problem.""

""Oh, she can't be here either,"" D said.

""Why?""

D turned a bright shade of red and bit her lip. ""I don't want her to think I'm a freak of nature.""

""Why would she?"" I asked, furrowing my brow.

""From what I know, the delivery won't be altogether normal. I'm pretty sure our kids will come from eggs.""

I'm a screenwriter, and I started immediately working on turning that prompt into a screenplay.

And I did. And I got it into the top 100 semi-finalists of the Sundance Table Read My Screenplay competition! That might not sound like too much, but after writing screenplays for many years, this was the first time I was actually confident to try to do something with it. Now, I'm desperately searching for an agent who likes it enough to accept it, using the age-old tactic of IMDbPro and many, many e-mails.

But the idea didn't leave my head. The characters I created didn't leave my head, until eventually they were living fully-fledged lives with fully-fledged backstories inside my head. I was, as the saying goes, an entire universe inside a skull. So, I begun writing in prose. At first, I anticipated a three-page quick summary to give my characters backstory for a new rewrite of the screenplay.

But today, I've just finished the first draft of my first novel! It stands right now at a behemoth 500 pages, which I do not at all look forward to cutting down! But I've done it. I've written a novel, and I am so eternally grateful to Writing Prompts for giving me the inspiration to do it, and to /u/bigrickcook for giving me the idea to run with. I really, really want to do something great with this, I'm incredibly proud of both the screenplay and novel and as a young writer, I'm just so proud to say that I actually completed them both! 

Seriously, this community is great, and I implore all writers to come here because all it takes is a glance of one prompt to set you on a two-year journey that will end with your first novel and a screenplay! :)

EDIT: 

Wow! Wasn't expecting this. I also would never usually write one of these 'EDIT FRONT PAGE' things but it's different when it's something so personal to me. 

A lot of people are asking about the book itself. It's called 'Hadal Zone' and it follows a man called George Orr whose dreams show him a small five minute snippet of the next night, and how this has affected him throughout his life. I thought hard about what seeing the future would do to a person, and let this sink in with the character for a while - it's where I started. As I went about my day, I wondered how George would do it, and I came to the conclusion that he would be disconnected from everything. For example, he often uses his dreams to seduce girls, so his dream will be of him having sex with a woman - the next day, when he wakes up, he knows that he will be with that woman that night, so when he does bump into her, he's able to say whatever he wants to her whatsoever, knowing it will conclude with their relations.

I didn't let the possible plothole of ""what if he just doesn't have sex with her?"" come into play, I really focused on that, and let that flow through. It was really interesting to write because of this concept. I also go into a lot of detail on his backstory, and how he came to be, and where his powers originate and where they come from. I guess the three main inspiring books were Ursula Le Guin's The Lathe of Heaven (from which I took the protagonists name, although I've no idea whether that will be legal!) and Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon. Both books are incredible and deal with science-fiction in a really human way, which I liked. But the main book was J.W. Dunne's An Experiment with Time - a philosophy book from the 1930s that deals with precognitive dreams. I used Dunne's theory of a serial time to build upon my character's power and what it means.

My one piece of advice would be to know your characters well. Really well. And don't ignore them, follow them when they run in one direction because otherwise you won't be being honest to them. You'll find that the story you're writing might be completely different from the one you originally set out to pen, but that's fine, because good characters will always create good stories. I knew this story, from the prompt, was going to be all about the character, and if I didn't have a good character then the rest would be lost. 

So, yeah, I am going to save up some money and pay for a professional editing service (absolutely no idea how much that costs!) and then self-publish it, I think. And I don't want to make any money from it, I just want people to read it, but believe you and me that if I ever make any money from it whatsoever, then /u/bigrickcook will certainly see some of it, because s/he planted the seed in my head!

Thanks again!"

---

Smoke rippled into flame.

My physical body burned to ash as my soul ripped out of the fiendish plane. The change tickled at what charred nerves I had left before I reformed in a burst of smoke.

The material world rose around me. It adjusted as my body was molded from fire. As soon as the last of me was complete, my senses sharpening to their edged heights, the smoke dissipated into nothing and the summoning was complete.

A demonic grin spread across my lips. Fitting, given the circumstances. I looked around, scouring the field on which I would do battle. The space in which I would destroy. The land on which I would scorch air to ash. Whatever my summoner wanted now that the ritual was complete.

I stepped forward, blinking at the scene. My eyes narrowed on the stained furniture. The rough, mismanaged hardwood floor. The blue-painted walls chipped and torn due to misuse. My brow furrowed as I took another step forward, twisting to find my summoner and ascertain their need.

My clawed foot tore into an object on the floor. A book, I recognized when I looked down, my infernal soul licking the back of my eyes with tendrils of flame. I sneered.

Why was there a book?

Stepping back, I twisted. My head whipped around and I scanned over the ground to figure my summoning symbol. Yet, all I found were more books. More simple, mundane objects—a plastic folder, children’s toys. They were strewn about recklessly and formed into an adequate summoning circle as though purely by chance.

What was this?

I growled, the low, horrific sound cracking air around me. I’d been summoned—taken from the hellish abyss by a need for power. That was how most all demons came to Earth. By pure desire within a human for power as well as the knowledge to back it up. Most people summoned demons for gain—they used them to raze their enemies or rise up in positions of power.

But this… this wasn’t a ritual for advancement. This was a ritual of ignorance.

My eyes flared and I whipped around, searching for my summoner. For the human that cursed me with fulfilling a task that they hadn’t even known to come up with. I would torture that human, subject them to torments agonizing enough to match their idiocy. I would—

Crying.

I blinked, stopping in place. The flame of my infernal soul calmed, flickering in curiosity rather than rage. Glancing down, I found the source of the sound. The incessant, annoying noise.

A child.

My head tilted, contorting into a scowl. The boy in front of me, staring up with his large, wet human eyes—he couldn’t have been older than five. And as I watched him, the unfortunate truth descended upon me all too quickly. He was my summoner. Whether I liked it or not.

I scoffed. What power could a child even want?

Yelling.

I stopped again, simply staring at the boy. His piercing, misty blue eyes tore away from me and stared into the next room. At the loud, grown human man stumbling down a set of stairs. As soon as he saw, his wailing spawned anew. Tears streamed down pale cheeks and he hurried back as far as he could.

For a time I only watched, my rage suspended. The flame of my fiendish soul flickered in idle curiosity as the greedy, red-faced man wandered into the room. As soon as he did, the little boy shrieked in terror. Yet, despite the obvious call of emotion, the man only grinned even deeper.

He turned as he stumbled again. His glossy eyes fell upon me and flared out in anger. Not in disgust, nor confusion. They gazed at me as only an obstacle, a barrier between him and his son. The sense of pure ownership was obvious.

He spat at me, the excretion sizzling into steam before it even touched my skin. Then he cursed under his breath and threw his half-drunken bottle in my direction. I stepped out of the way, letting the glass shatter on a wall behind. But I didn’t let up my stare. I didn’t stop studying the man.

After his failed attempts to remove me, the man shook his head. Instead, he grew a grin far more wicked than even I would attempt and stepped toward the child. The boy wailed once again and tried to scurry away, walking toward me and all but pleading for my protection. That was when I began to understand.

I was a red-skinned, horned fiend of the abyss. Yet to the child, I wasn’t even the greatest monster in the room.

The man surged. I stepped right in his way, rebuking him with my eyes.

His wicked grin morphed away, softening as he staggered. “Let me see my little *boy*.”

I scowled, the breadth of his sin opening to me. He wasn’t simply abusive. He wasn’t simply greedy or possessive. He wasn’t simply *evil*. He deceived as well—tried to hide his true nature behind layers of fake love. My infernal soul flared to life, rage seeping right back in.

Even demons didn’t mislead about their nature. We laid our corruption plain and clear.

And all at once, I understood my summoner. I understood the reasoning that the child couldn’t put into words. He wasn’t ignorant. I’d been mistaken. He saw through his father’s deception. He saw through the lies, but the want for power stayed. It had even been realized through the summoning of my soul.

He wanted the power to stop it.

He wanted the power to make his father *stop*.

“He’s *mine*,” the man growled, losing the pretense of love entirely. Dropping his lie so that his true colors shined through in all of their vile, disgusting, irredeemable glory.

I shook my head, stopping the father again. The child had summoned me here for what power I could offer, and I would provide exactly that. I would honor my pact and protect the child until it was done.

The drunk human hobbled back before wheeling. He charged at me, a possessive glint shining through as he eyed his crying child. I pushed him back, the expression on my face twisted in disgust. I didn’t show hatred or pride or arrogance—this pact required none of it.

The boy had summoned a fiendish creature wrapped in flames. But staring back at the horrid, greedy, sinful man, I knew.

He’d been living with a demon all along.

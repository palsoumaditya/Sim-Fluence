a99fw9,TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,173983,0.95,8826,2018-12-25 03:58:35,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a99fw9/tifu_by_buying_everyone_an_ancestrydna_kit_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a99fw9/tifu_by_buying_everyone_an_ancestrydna_kit_and/,self.tifu,0,27,,text,False,False,False,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

P.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy. "
ak2k64,TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,148077,0.96,2565,2019-01-26 22:25:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ak2k64/tifu_by_living_in_a_dark_bedroom_for_6_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ak2k64/tifu_by_living_in_a_dark_bedroom_for_6_years/,self.tifu,0,14,,text,False,False,False,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. "

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

I love all of you weirdos <3

Edit 4: No more I promise. I'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W

Work was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. 

Food ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. 

Pertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. 

Both dogs were in the neighbor’s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog’s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the ”voice” for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. 

Pup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling ”RUNAWAY” and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. 

I didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. 

”Is that your dog?”

My bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? 

I’ll be nice because you brought my food. 

But she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, ”okay weird” but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking “okay weird...” again but didn’t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. 

I went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. 

Uh...ok? What’s going on here?

I go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn’t notice me. I walk up like I’m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you’ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I’m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. 

I don’t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. 

I continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor’s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. 

It clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. 

No hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver’s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. 

I don’t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor’s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn’t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. 

However, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. 

I splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn’t end worse. 

TL; DR

Ordered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn’t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn’t get shot but got cake in the end.

Edit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!

Taking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I’m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.

I’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

My wife hates orange and lime flavored candies. I love them. Well, love the orange, like the lime. 

So, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. 

What she doesn’t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. 

Shortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. 

So I haven’t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I’ve never said a word. I’ve enjoyed eating my little lies. 

Until last night…

We had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. 

She turned to me and asked if I’ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. 

I was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal…. She asked how long I’ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we’ve been married. 

She quit giving me the gummy bears she didn’t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. 

I don’t think I’ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.

Edit: 

We don’t eat these every day. A few times a year at most.

I don’t just get the “rejects.” It’s a shared bag. Whenever she grabs a few, she would pick out the orange and green and hand to me. Just like I would give the pineapple to her (bleh). 


TL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites."

This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

EDIT 2: RIP inbox

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

EDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit's history. Lord save me."

I'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.

So while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.

I'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.

Later on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

We are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

Tl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

She's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what I'm puttin down. It's a silly thing to be mad about.

They banned me on r/AskReddit for it.

I posted about it on here and changed my name to r/NazisStoleMyBirthday

r/AskReddit unbanned me.

This post blew up and got really popular. It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit

This morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.

Some of you won’t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it’s worth, I would never say things that, much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account, but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.

This was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again, some won’t believe that and that’s ok.

If you care, you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.

I’m sorry everyone. I think I’m done with Reddit entirely."

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

UPDATE: There’s a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. It wasn’t. She was with this guy for 3 years."
7pafrt,TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.,107673,0.95,4420,2018-01-10 03:00:10,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7pafrt/tifu_by_stuffing_my_face_with_edibles_before/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7pafrt/tifu_by_stuffing_my_face_with_edibles_before/,self.tifu,0,23,,text,False,False,False,"Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""Please don't die, we have a mortgage."""

Finally getting around to really processing it all and I guess trying to deal with it.

Went out for drinks with my girlfriend and met up with my younger cousin at the bar. We'd all hung out once before and had a great time. My cousin invited a couple of her friends to the bar too; we did some barhopping. I got shitfaced pretty unintentionally (The last bar was, I swear, not putting any mixers in my cocktails, they were straight alcohol). So anyway we're about to leave and my cousin's friends are trying to get her home, because she's shitfaced too. Well, my gf was our DD so we offered to let her stay in our spare room. Everyone was cool with that because who's safer than family, right?

Wrong. We get home and (I had to piece together some of this later because I blacked out for most of it) apparently initially everything was cool. My cousin went to the spare room and my gf got her situated. The problems started a little later when I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to walk straight out of my bedroom with my girlfriend in it, and into my cousin's room. I don't particularly remember much except for two details which I guess are not important to the story. Well, okay so one might be. I remember her giving me a *very* enthusiastic BJ, which, as you can imagine, makes a lot of noise. Apparently after a while my gf came out of the room wondering where I was because I just fucking disappeared. She didn't barge into the room or anything, but she heard the noises which is pretty fucking obvious. So at that point, she left. Like, me. She left me, and I don't blame her.

Anyway that means I wake up the next morning, having blacked out, oblivious that my gf was gone already, but I'm fucking naked next to my naked cousin. There's cum all over the bed where her face was, she didn't even sleep with a pillow. There's obviously no hiding this but I'm still half-drunk and I went to try to go sneak back into my room, which I found empty. So yeah.

I haven't heard from my gf all week, and I'm sure we're done, and I don't blame her. All I can hope for now is that this shit doesn't get out to my family, because I would probably implode. No, my cousin and I are not going to start hooking up regularly. It's actually super awkward and she has hardly said a word to me either. Again, I don't blame her.

TL;DR drunkenly slept with my cousin, ruined my relationship, family might hear about it, I'm an idiot."

I told him he would get it back next week.

Well he’s a pretty clever dude and knew all my hiding places, so I put it someplace he would never look.

Except I suffered a TBI a few years earlier and I forget stuff. So when he did his homework and asked for it back after a week, I ... could not find it. Aargh. I looked everywhere.

Narrator: Obviously not everywhere...

Then we moved house. And I still didn’t find it. 

Spongebob: 18 YEARS LATER...

I was donating some coats I had not worn in a long time. And in the pocket of a Viennese trench coat from the 1930’s, I found... his Gameboy Advance. And turned it on. And it WORKED. Pokémon appeared. 

I put fresh batteries into it and handed it to my 28 year old son. Who proceeded to laugh for a good five minutes. Then played it for a few hours. Then proceeded to tell my wife and other adult children how silly I was.

TL/DR: Hid kid’s Gameboy, forgot where. Found it almost 20 years later. Family has further proof that I’m an idiot."

So, I work for the TSA, and have for a few years now. It's a good job overall. I'm underpaid, but the benefits are nice, and I get overtime when I want it.

A little over a year ago, during the week leading up to Christmas, we had some really bad weather that delayed all the flights. I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer

I was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it's a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.

Mom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.

Kid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he's about 13, maybe 14.

I hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.

I tell him that I have to pat that area down. He's a little nervous, I figure that because he's so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.

I do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn't look chubby at all.

I move to the right side of the chest, read what's on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He's not wearing sweatpants, \*she\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn't even know the couple that just came through.

I look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.

I immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what's wrong, and I explain the situation to her.

My supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she's trying not to laugh.

She takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.

Once that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it's fine, that it wasn't the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.

She tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won't happen, and I shouldn't be worried.

That reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.

I swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there's no way I have the energy to cook dinner.

I saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).

I apologize again, she says it's fine, and I ask her if she's planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.

I tell her that I'm getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it's only fair that I buy her dinner.

She agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.

She said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it's not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men's bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn't walk into the ladies' room.

She laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.

She said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.

I agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.

We just celebrated our one year anniversary.

She has long hair now.

tl;dr: Thought an adult woman was a teenage boy, touched her on the boob, everything worked out better than expected."

My immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

Never going back.

h7mzd3,TIFU by jumping into a lake in my bra/panties to save a man that turned out to be an elite military scuba diver in training,93924,0.93,3555,2020-06-12 21:08:33,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/h7mzd3/tifu_by_jumping_into_a_lake_in_my_brapanties_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/h7mzd3/tifu_by_jumping_into_a_lake_in_my_brapanties_to/,self.tifu,0,12,,text,False,False,False,"I’m couch-surfing with my sister and her BF; I work for him at the lake-side bar, trying to pay for college. My state is “open” and while I’m not thrilled, I need both the job and my scored sofa accommodations to make it work. To give them their space, and myself a break from the doomscrolling, I take a run by the lake in the mornings. This lake is bombass and draws scuba divers to the flooded town at the bottom.

Today, I was in my own head running when a dark mass floated to the surface 40 feet away. I was on the craggy side of the lake and this dude looked dead. D.E.A.D. Facing away from me, his head was tipped back, eyes closed, bobbing like a fishing lure. No one else was around, so I thought he was quantum crazy out here scuba diving alone at the crackass of dawn, giving himself the bends or some nonsense.

Like a jackass, I didn’t yell at him to check-in. Instead, I toed off my shoes and stripped to my skivvies to save the imbecile. The movie trailer in my head had me taking three glorious steps and launching into the deep blue water, black widow style. Instead, my tender feet hit the sharp rocks and I contorted under the pain like a slinky as I uncoordinatedly pitched myself into the water, doing a side-flop. I was also wearing my contacts so I swam hard in his direction with my eyes closed.

When I open them, he was dead-ass staring at me like I’d lost my ever-lovin’ mind, so I blurted, “Are you okay?”

He removed the regulator and incredulously said “yes”.

My brain blue-screened while I tread water. The lake felt infinitely deep. Before I could terrify myself by hearing the jaws theme song, I turned to nope the hell out of there, yelling over my shoulder, “I thought you needed saving” to explain my idiocy.

As I pivoted, another dude cleared his throat from 30 feet away on the other side. I never heard a sound from him so I freaked out, failing and belting an ear wounding scream at him.

Both asshats laughed as a few more heads surfaced around us. I was surrounded by divers all wildly entertained by my ridiculous high-octane FU. After pointing to me and the beach, the merman that was my original target cautiously swam toward me after I nodded and “escorted” me to the shore.

The beach was much further than I had anticipated, so I was trying to low-key breath, hiding my need to suck all of the O2 from the air. Also, the comedy of the situation consumed me and I started to giggle. Finally, I joked, “Dude, you are lucky you weren’t actually dying because It would have taken everything I have to drag your sorry ass this far.”

He chuckled before offering me a “tow.”

“Hell, no! Not gonna happen.” Even if I had to dog paddle, I wouldn’t openly accept that defeat.

He quietly mocked me the rest of the way to the shore. I’m a secret sap for it.

They were cadets or recent graduates from a military college, here for the summer. They’ve been training in pools and were doing some “open water” exercises; they had been out there at least part of the night. I’m sure I blew-up whatever drill they were running. He’s training for pre-dive school (?) and since I am an expert googler, I’m guessing that means combat diving.

At the shore, I did my best to throw my shoulders back and march out of the water in my sports bra and undies in front of what I can only imagine are some pretty badass men. I did invite him and his clandestine crew for an absurdly overpriced beer at the bar tonight before shame-jogging back into the woods for my clothes.

TL;DR I tried to save an injured diver-ended up crashing some kind of military training.

EDIT: It's Lake Jocassee in SC. Also, the mereman cheated: he was wearing a floaty vest and fins, that bastard. Ok, I’ll admit there is a part of me that is attracted to his mysterious appearance from the shadow realm, and I’m definitely imaging that he’s constructed from some kind of aluminum steel alloy, but he was also funny and kind. I was vibing his proclivity for witty and sarcastic comments and have a million questions I want to ask him. Ha

EDIT2: Okay, at work now and had to turn off the notifications because you snippers are blowing me up. To all the ladies giving advice earlier...yes, I left the dragon-flies at home and went full cute sundress and Jesus sandals. Tried to wear my hair straight, but it's hot as hate out here and it'll be beach wave sweaty before long. My sister's BF has blabbed the whole thing and all of the staff is in full-on ribbing mode. Kinda great actually. They are currently reading the Reddit post so they are cackling at you people too. So, even if he doesn't show, we're gonna have a great night. We have a long way to go since it's just the dinner crowd, but thanks for making my day great people.

EDIT3: Solid dinner crowd, but no mereman, or frog prince as you people have started to call him. Our lakeside drinking crew will start rolling in another 1-2 hours. I thought you salty bastards of TIFU would chew me up and spit me out, but look at you all showing up in the name of love! You guys are awesome, even if I get ditched it was worth the day with you.

EDIT4: 1 hor later. Still no show :(

EDIT5: HE SHOWED! Holy shit, a little bit ago. Yes, I was as dorky as you would have imagined and now I’m typing this from the bathroom like a dumbass again, but I feel like you people are on the ride with me. He’s handsome and funny and he smells great. Yes, I hugged him. I’m southern…its what we do…not the smelling, the hugging. He’s nice, and smart and keeps defending me from my jackass friends at the bar, who have almost called him merman to his face. I think he low-key likes that everyone knew who he was, but not sure how he’ll feel about being a Reddit celebrity. I’ve learned a lot about him, but it wouldn’t be fair to share without his permission. His whole crew did not come, only one and his bud immediately started flirting with my co-worker. That’s a good sign. I think. Holy, shit you’d think I’d never met up with a guy before. Also, my friend straight up asked him if he saw my “dragonfly undies that look like penises with MASSIVE, glow-in-the-dark turquoise blue balls” only she used the Reddit version  (thanks for that nickname Reddit). He didn’t answer but smirked the truth to me after she left. It was cheeky but cute. He’s also been sharing some of the shit that he's been taking today from being “saved”. He has the same self-deprecating sense of humor as me. I think we are vibing. So, that’s all the updates for tonight. He’s getting the rest of my attention. Keep sending me those good vibes and peace people.

EDIT6: Last and final update because you guys are not letting up. I know this may seem weird since I posted this whole situation out into cyberspace for everyone to see, but yesterday it was just a comical story about a guy I didn't think I would ever see again. Something funny to share when we all need a giggle. Today...well...it feels different to talk about him now that we've spent some time together. I like him. There’s chemistry and similar interest and we have plans to see each other again. I don’t need the pressure of Reddit to help me screw things up. You guys know I’m a bit of an expert in that regard. That’s all, so go do something you love and find a way to at least balance the doomscrolling with some belly laughs. Sending much love to each of you.

EDIT7: “Updates!” You people keep screaming over 3 weeks later. Don’t you have better things to do than pester me about my love life? Ha. The merman, the frog prince, the dashing man from depths, the king of the shadow realm (and the many other nicknames that Reddit has bestowed) is still very much in my life.

I was discussing this subreddit with a guy (we’ll call him M) I’m flirting with... and we come across the hot sauce story, felt like it sounded like our mutual friend (he can be called B)

So I take a screenshot and go to send it on FB messenger to send to B.... muscle memory kicks in and I send the photo so quick my camera roll hadn’t updated... I accidentally sent a nude I’d taken half hour earlier. 

This wouldn’t be an issue usually... but this guy is like a brother figure. He’s not answering his phone so I’ve just spammed the fuck out of the conversation to stop it popping up.

All the while I’m on the phone to M, the initial intended recipient....who is also in a band with B.

6r3xyb,TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV,87071,0.89,2644,2017-08-02 18:21:02,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6r3xyb/tifu_by_having_my_reddit_history_revealed_by/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6r3xyb/tifu_by_having_my_reddit_history_revealed_by/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

Unaware that I already paid with my debit card, I walk to my door with $30 and gave him a 20% tip on top of that which had been paid online.

The driver was about in his mid 30's, barely spoke English and he was driving a beat up car. He said ""thank you!"" very enthusiastically which made me realize in about 2 seconds that I just gave him double the money for the order, which he would obviously receive as a tip. I was about to admit my mistake and ask for the money back... before I saw his reaction while he was walking to his car.

He had a smile from ear to ear like he found the cure for Covid or struck gold or something. He even did this little mini jump before he hopped into his car. I'm not exactly Bill Gates, I still have debts to pay, but I'm glad I fucked up to help someone who needed the money more than I did.

Anyways, I felt pretty dumb after, but the joy I saw in that man made my week. Not a very interesting story, but it was pretty cool for me, as my Dad moved to Canada from across the world with only a bike and a few hundred bucks.

TL;DR Paid double for a pizza by being drunk. No regrets. Ok... little to no regrets."
u7wwey,TIFU by thinking my son was having gay sex when he was just eating Hummus,85783,0.81,3687,2022-04-20 19:16:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u7wwey/tifu_by_thinking_my_son_was_having_gay_sex_when/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u7wwey/tifu_by_thinking_my_son_was_having_gay_sex_when/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,True,False,False,"So I (39F) have a son (15M) and he brought a friend round today.

They immediately went to their room and I assumed they would just play some video games or whatever so I was totally fine leaving them. 

 It was about 30 minutes in when I was walking past, I heard sounds such as 'Omg that's so good' and 'Its so good with that in it' and various 'mmmm' sounds.

It really sounded like they were having gay sex, I was super weirded out by it so I quickly went downstairs and waited for his friend to leave. When this friend left an hour or two later I asked my son what they were doing in his room (because although I don't mind him being gay, and ik it's normal for teenagers to have sex, a condom really should be used) so I planned to confront him about that.

However the answer shocked me to my very core. They weren't having sex, they were _eating hummus_.

I was shocked, and initially didn't believe it. We had never had hummus before and I asked him to show me the hummus if this was true. So he did, and I ate hummus for the first time, and oh my god was it good. We experimented with different things in it like bread and carrots and it was great. Apparently his friend had heard about how he had never had hummus before and thought this was absurd so had planned a date for a hummus party.

So yeah, it ended up being quite a good ending, i discovered how nice hummus was.


TLDR: Thought my son was having gay sex, he just really liked hummus."

I am Joe, I have been a lurking for a while. I created this account to get my story across, I have no idea what I am planning to achieve by doing so, but I hope it can help those who are at crossroads and are stuck between passion and safety.

For the past 15 years of life, I have been a dentist, a path that I chose after leaving a job to study further in the hopes I will make more money. I do not even know why I cared about money when I did not even spend any of it. I met my wife before I started school, when I was 20, when I was a risktaker, a dreamer and wanted to change the world.

Now I’m in a place where I have chronic pain, a cheating wife, kids who don’t love me, a life of staring into mouths all day, a dull brain, no more passions and hopes, no real purpose in life.

I wanted to work as a social worker or an educator, but my parents and wife thought that I could help people in other ways that pay well. They convinced me to take dentistry and I did. I hated every minute of school, I did not want to be in a place where my back would ache, neck would ache and it was not solving the real cause of the problem, but just the result of what happens after people let go of their teeth. All my friends convinced me that it will be rewarding, and I will make a lot of money when I am out of school and I let them.

When I was a young man, I wanted to do so many things, I used to play music, I wanted to become a musician, I wanted to be a teacher raising future people who could change the world. I loved physics and mathematics, but my parents told me to follow money instead of passions.

Today I have 2 kids, a wife and they all expect me to provide them with a luxurious lifestyle. I have never cared for money, the most enjoyable time in my life was when I was sleeping on a futon in a rental running a small business selling jars of jam made with strawberries from a local farm and also working as a tutor for a bunch of spoilt kids. I had very little, but I was happy, I feel like I should have become an educator/business owner instead of taking a career I hate.

From the past 15 years, I have developed chronic pain from doing dentistry, gained at least 20 kilos, made a million dollars but for what? I can’t even do anything because of chronic back pain.

After becoming a dentist, I worked 9-4, 5 days a week,  I would come back home exhausted, plan my next day, manage the business side of things, have dinner with my kids and wife, sleep and repeat. Have a few weeks here and there as holidays where I would take my family away for a vacation.

My kids don’t even talk to me anymore, my wife and I have not had sex for months and I’m 100% that she’s cheating on me with a better-looking man who is older than me, I have seen her phone and confirmed this, but I will not bring it up because I don’t have anyone except her left in my life, she has been my only support throughout this and if she leave, I have nothing left. My kids will probably be split and hate their dad because their mom has raised them, my life feels like a joke.

I remember when I was in my 20s, I used to be popular with the girls, I had countless opportunities to go out with girls I found more attractive than my wife but I didn’t because I cared for her. In hindsight, I should have just done what I wanted to. Maybe my wife would still be attracted to me, I would be healthier and fitter.

If I had my life all over again, I would not settle down so early, I would date more and find more interesting friends, I would never choose to be a dentist!

I should have stuck to my passion for business/physics/teaching/music etc. Even though I would have been broke, I think I would not have cared, I would wake up everyday working towards a better future, work harder because I am not handed money on a silver platter, the list can go on.

I feel that it's too late to go back to pursue my passions now, my kids have expectations, my wife has expectations, society thinks that I am useful and important.

Sorry if this is a long read, but I just had to say it. I truly have made a joke out of the one life I was given by choosing money, stability, safety, other people’s opinions over my real passions.

To all the people stuck between money/stability/safety and passions, just chase your passions because the safe path does not guarantee that you’ll live a life that was worth living.

TL:DR – I ruined my life by continuing  to do what I hated – dentistry. It has ruined my marriage, health, family, my passions, my mind. Do what you are passionate about, f\*\*\* societal expectations.

EDIT:  
I was not expecting this post to get so much attention as it has, I just posted it as a whim to tell atleast someone about it. I was very emotional at the time and did not proof read anything that I typed.

Honestly reading your thoughts, encouragement and most importantly your own personal stories, I feel like I'm gaining a new perspective at life and how I can change it, for the first time in a very long time, I feel that maybe this is not the end. I don't have to die a slave to a system that does not support my life or adds any value to my life.

I will put down answers to recurring questions below as they come up and keep you guys updated on what I will do with my life in this post. Thank you reddit for giving me hope."

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, ""Okay, well I have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

Tl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

Edit: Of course we took the gardasil. Shout out to nurse Pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. I wish everyone could have a nurse Pete. Also, since I'm editing, thanks for the awards!"
h09mz8,TIFU by pretending to be deaf for the entire quarantine.,80672,0.91,4555,2020-06-10 17:41:07,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/h09mz8/tifu_by_pretending_to_be_deaf_for_the_entire/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/h09mz8/tifu_by_pretending_to_be_deaf_for_the_entire/,self.tifu,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"So, three months ago or whenever it was that the Quarantine started I started an online course for a few subjects. To provide some background, these aren’t my school classes or anything and I’ve never met these people before. There are maybe ten other kids in class and the teacher is actually pretty great. 

So the first two days go pretty well but on the third day I fuck up big time. We were in between a Physics class that had already been going on for an hour and I’d completely gotten distracted half way through. I have an incredibly low attention span and this was already too much for me. 

When the teacher called my name to answer his question, I had no idea what he’d been talking about so I tried to google it. However I have shitty internet so it took like really long to load and the teacher was getting pissed as to why I wasn’t responding and why I was typing. So, completely freaking out I decided to text him on the Google Meet chat and make an excuse that my laptop’s audio AND microphone are not working today and I’ve been reading the subtitles which take quite some time to load so I hadn’t quite gotten his question. 

In my immense panic I phrased this somewhat vaguely and said - *I can’t actually hear I’ve been reading the subtitles they take quite some time to load*

To which the instructor said - *Oh! I’m so sorry. I wasn’t aware that you are deaf*

In my intense panic and anxiety I just went along with it. 

Dumb as fuck.

It actually worked out fine, I’d type out all the answers sent to me and even bought a hearing aid that I sometimes wore in class. Now I say *sometimes* because I don’t actually have the focus and commitment to remember to put it on every class. When asked about it I told the people in class that even with the hearing aid I can’t hear much so I don’t usually bother wearing it. They bought it. 

Everyone in class likes me a lot now too and they find me very endearing. There’s a girl, Carla who says I have the most beautiful smile she’s ever seen. So this was actually going really well for me. 

But like most of my antics, this backfired on me big time. 

When I made this godforsaken decision all that time ago I was sure I’d get away with it. We were never going to meet irl. However, about a week ago the instructor decided to meet irl as the lockdown in my country has been lifted. I spent all night watching videos of deaf people and trying to figure out how to behave. I decided to pretend to also be completely dumb so I wouldn’t have to try to speak like them. It seemed very hard and I didn’t want to try. 

So anyway we meet up and everything goes well. No one uncovers my secret or anything. I spend the entire irl meet with Carla who is completely fucking stunning in real life. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s kind. We keep handing each other notes on tissue papers and it’s the cutest shit ever. I haven’t ever been this attracted to anyone in my entire life. Toward the end of the meet however, Carla hands me a tissue paper with one little heartbreaking sentence on it.

*Will you date me?*

Fuck. 

Panicking, I tell her I need some time to think and she’s chill with it. 

I’m supposed to be meeting up with her tomorrow. I can’t pretend to be deaf and dumb while dating her it’s fucking impossible but if I have to keep this charade up I’ll have to let her go and I don’t want to do that either.

There’s also the other option where I tell her it was all an act. Best case scenario is the extreme embarrassment + amazing girlfriend and the worst case scenario is she thinks I’m an asshole and I lose her anyway. 

tl;dr - I pretended to be deaf because I wasn’t paying attention in class and now I might be missing out an amazing girlfriend.

Edit - She just texted me what time to pick her up. The date is actually TONIGHT not tomorrow so I have way lesser time to make this decision than I expected. Haha, I’m like a disaster that keeps on happening. Anyways, you should have an update in about 6-7 hours which is when I’ll meet her.

UPDATE - So this is the update y’all have been waiting for, I just got back from the date with Carla.

So basically I prepared really hard for the date, googled what the appropriate flowers for apologizing for your lies are and got her White Orchids. I then put on my best clothes and set out. 

She’d come to the date with a cute little notepad and two pencils for us to write notes in which melted me instantly but I was so anxious and nervous that at first I couldn’t bring myself to tell her. But as we sat waiting for our order to arrive, I kinda snapped cause of guilt and scribbled down into the notebook.

*Hey, there’s not easy way to break this but I’m not actually deaf . . . . . Or dumb*

To which she replied with,

*I know you’re not deaf but you ARE pretty dumb :)*

At which point I said *What the fuck* out loud.

She then laughed and explained that she’d thought I was so cute that she’d googled me long ago and found my Instagram which has highlighted stories from concerts where I’m screaming and vibing. So she only asked me out to figure out for how long I’d keep it going. 

So she was actually playing me the whole time.

I was feeling pretty bummed that she only wanted to date me for that but nevertheless I apologized profusely and showed her the Reddit post to explain myself. 

Best.move.ever. (Thank you so much everyone in the comments who asked me to do this)

She found the post funny and cute and ‘adorkable’. I told her I totally understand if she wants to end the date now but she didn’t! We had a great time and aren’t officially dating or anything but we did set a second date for next Wednesday.

She also told me that while she understands why I did what I did and that anxiety, especially social anxiety is so hard to deal with but she also believes that I was a little offensive especially with the hearing aid. She explained to me why that was so insensitive and I’d like to apologize for anyone I might have offended on here, it really wasn’t my intention!

Also, for our second date we’re planning to volunteer at a centre for deaf kids so I can redeem myself. 

Thank you fucking Reddit, y’all might’ve just got me a girlfriend!"

So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you’re all giving me, it’s rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won’t necessarily be responding to them all.

I’m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn’t the original intention, but it’s a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It’s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it’s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they’ve subsided and I’m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn’t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I’m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it’s been a truly interesting experience. I didn’t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn’t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It’s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I’m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It’s been great to see this happen, and I’m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

TL;DR - Made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks I’m a racist bastard."
ih79se,TIFU by realizing the older woman I’ve been sleeping with for months is my coworkers mom.,79343,0.87,4206,2020-08-27 02:26:18,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ih79se/tifu_by_realizing_the_older_woman_ive_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ih79se/tifu_by_realizing_the_older_woman_ive_been/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,True,,False,"**UPDATES BELOW**

Throwaway account, this literally happened like an hour ago. So I (M25) have been involved with an older woman (F44) lately. 

It started a few months ago with the onset of Coronavirus, I was on Tinder trying to find someone to hook up with during quarantine so as to stay safe and also kill some time. I saw this very attractive older woman and decided to swipe right because you know, it’s every 20-something year olds dream to hook up with a Milf. A few days go by and I get a notification that I have a new match. Wahoo! I open up the app and lo and behold it’s the fine ass cougar I was hoping for. 

We start chatting and flirting, it’s going really well. Out of nowhere she messages me and says “I’m not sure how this app works, do we just meet to have sex or do we go on a date first?” I was drinking coffee at the time and promptly shot it out both nostrils. My chance had come. I replied back that people generally just meet up to go to the Bone Zone together but I’m easy either way. She replies “well good because I hate formalities” I nearly shit my pants in excitement. She sends me her address and tells me she’s free on Friday and to bring wine. The rest of that whole week was a complete blur of anxiety. I could not fuck this up. 

So Friday comes, I show up with wine, she looks fucking smoking hot. Better in person. We talk about music and travelling and all that, not many personal details (which would come back to haunt me) just sort of arts & culture talk. A few glasses of wine later and were full blown going at it like rabbits on the middle of her living room floor. I left a little while later feeling like I’m the king of the entire universe and go to sleep. 

The next day she texts me saying how she had a great time, and it made her feel young again and blah blah blah. She says she’s off every Friday and Saturday and that next week we should do the same. 

This has been going on for roughly 3 months, we meet up once or twice a week, fuck like animals, and then go on our merry way until one of us gets horny again. Sweet deal right? Wrong. 

I messaged her yesterday saying that I had today off of work and asked if she wanted to meet up, she said her son was taking her out to lunch, and that I could come over at 3pm. She had mentioned she had a son before but didn’t go any further and I didn’t really care to ask.

So 3pm comes and I’m almost at her house when she messages me that she’s running late; no problem. I park on the road and sort of just wait in my car because her car wasn’t in the driveway yet. I’m sitting there listening to the radio when an oddly familiar SUV pulls into the drive. I sorta looked at it funny and then I immediately realized where I knew it from. My coworker(M23) jumps out of the front seat, goes around to her side of the vehicle, gives her a kiss on the cheek and a hug and then jumps back in the car. My jaw was on the ground. 

He reversed out of the driveway and stupid me is sitting like a deer in the headlights in plain sight. He turns around and is literally 10 feet in front of my car and staring directly at me. My face goes bright red and I feel like I’m going to vomit. Me and this guy work together every single day and I consider him a friend of mine, I even trained him when he started at my company. And the kicker is I’ve been telling him (in detail) about this older lady and he’s been giving me immense kudos about it saying that it’s “his dream”.

He pulls up beside me and looks very confused, asks me what I’m doing and how funny it was we ran into each other. I panic completely and stumble over my words and pretend like I’m on the wrong street and trying to find my cousins house. He looked skeptical but sort of shrugged it off. The whole time his mother is standing there watching us through the curtains. He directs me where to go and I pull off and then circle back once he’s gone. 

Needless to say I went inside and told her what was up, and we both sort of sat there in silence before I left. No boom boom today. 

I am now panicking, there’s no way he’s not going to know right? And he’s gonna realize all these wild escapades with this she devil night mistress I’ve been telling him about is actually his mom? Fuck. I already called in sick for work tomorrow because I cannot look him in the eye. 

Will update if anything happens. 

Pray for my soul Reddit. 

UPDATE: she just texted me and says that we should tell him and come clean because it’s the right thing to do. WHAT THE FUCK. How do I politely explain that I’ve told her son in detail about our escapades including the time I dripped candle wax on her butthole? (she a freak) 

UPDATE 2: she’s adamant about telling him, even after I informed her about the explicit details I’ve been sharing since we started doing this. What is wrong w this woman. I’m seriously debating quitting my job, I know her son well and he’s gonna want to fucking kill me. She keeps insisting that “he’s a grown up and he should realize that his mother is a person too with desires like any other person” THATS NOT THE POINTTTTTT. Fuck. I’m fucked bro’s. 

UPDATE 3: she said regardless of what I say she’s telling him tomorrow, because she can’t “live with the guilt and deceit” she won’t answer my calls at all. Not going over to her house because she’s out somewhere. I’m fucked, will update again. Let my tombstone read “died doing what he loved best”. 

UPDATE 4: Well gentleman, the cat is out of the bag. His mother pulled the trigger and came clean about it all. I don’t even know what to say. He called me saying it was super weird and he’s mindfucked but he’s not mad because he knows we had no idea. He asked if it was her I’d been talking about the whole time and I said yes, then he must’ve felt suicidal because he asked “....even all that crazy stuff?” RIP BRO. Needless to say I laughed and changed the subject, you’ve been through enough today my child. 

He also said he’s gonna look for a new job & already gave his two weeks notice because it’ll be weird working together. Damn. He genuinely just seems bummed as fuck. His mother is an idiot and I feel scummy as hell. He also said he put in a transfer so we won’t be working in the same building until he’s gone. Jeez. Going to see his Mom later and telling her we can’t do this anymore, she caused him to lose a job and a friend and a reason to go to therapy over something we could’ve likely played off. I think that’s the end of it though, didn’t expect this to blow up so big but thanks for all the awards and comments! At least someone gained something positive from this rollercoaster haha. 

Can’t believe I made my own son quit his job. Damn. 

Thanks Reddit! 

TLDR; banging hot older woman for a few months, go to meet with her. Coworker drops her off and I learn that she’s his mother. He sees me waiting and seems skeptical about my lie as to what I was doing. My world crushes. RIP Me.

To put things into perspective, I (M 20) and my GF (F 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. Typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

We decide to spice things up a bit and “open” up our relationship a little. It was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole “sex is fun” idea.

She is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she’s met a guy (M 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn’t working at the time. I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

The week after, she mentions she’s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn’t expecting it but I’m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn’t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she’s just having a good time?

The next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a “break” from “everything” right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we’re over. She’s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she’s with him. I’ve heard from her friends that they’re dating now. 

TLDR; Agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me."
jcs1n7,TIFU after getting high with my fianceé,76942,0.85,7272,2020-10-17 14:50:30,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jcs1n7/tifu_after_getting_high_with_my_fianceé/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jcs1n7/tifu_after_getting_high_with_my_fianceé/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"Last night I finally managed to convince my fianceé to smoke weed with me. She's always been anti-420, but now that we're just a few weeks away from getting married and being all grown up and shit, she's gone full YOLO. 

Fast forward to me seeing my fianceé high for the first time. She became extremely relaxed and talkative. It was cute at first, listening to her go on and on about life and love. But then shit kind of got specific. She mentioned how she never expected to be with someone like me. 

I didn't even have to encourage her to explain because the floodgates were already wide open. All those details spilled out without any fucking filter. This is what I learned from my fianceé that I never knew before: 

1. Most of her past relationships ended because she was notoriously promiscuous.

2. As per #1: one of those relationships came to an end after she cheated on her boyfriend by hooking up with his younger brother, while also cheating on the damn brother, with his best friend, who just so happened to be the same sex.

3. I'm the first guy she's had to do the ""fake orgasm thing"" with. Apparently all her exes pushed all the right buttons whereas I don't.

4. My asthma is a turn off when it comes to sex because she feels like she needs to hold back, so that I don't get too excited and die.

5. All her exes had horse dicks (of course they did!). I'm her first average.

Those were some of the key points. I was too traumatised to register whatever else she said afterwards. I don't think I blinked for the rest of the evening.

**TL:DR Convinced my fianceé to get high on relationship-destroying weed.**

*Update: Even though I knew what my fianceé said would haunt me forever, I was willing to bury it in the back of my mind and pretend like last night never even happened. However, my fianceé wanted to talk. So we did. It was brutal. She said my mom was right about her being wrong for me. Long story short, all of this shit was building up to her admitting she'd been sending nudes to one of her horse dick exes. A fucking Chad. I'm emotionally destroyed. It doesn't feel real yet, so I have trouble accepting it's over. But it is. Guess I'm returning that ring and getting a PS5. Appreciate all the advice.*"

But today, I'm here in a different capacity, as a fellow Redditor who's made a big oopsie. So here it goes... TIFU by deciding to eliminate third-party apps, and as a result, unintentionally creating a crisis for our beloved platform.

Like most TIFUs, it started with good intentions. I wanted to centralize user experience, enhance quality control, and create uniformity. I thought having everyone on the official app would simplify things and foster a better, more unified Reddit experience.

But oh, how I was wrong.

First, the backlash was instant and palpable. Users and moderators alike expressed concerns about the utility and convenience that these third-party apps offered. I heard stories of how some apps like RiF had become an integral part of their Reddit journey, especially for moderators who managed communities big and small.

Then came the real shocker. In protest, moderators began to set their subreddits to private. Some of the largest, most active corners of Reddit suddenly went dark. The impact was more significant than I'd ever anticipated.

Frustration mounted, and so did regret. This wasn't what I wanted. I never intended to disrupt the community spirit that defines Reddit or make the jobs of our volunteer moderators harder.

Yet, here we are.

I've made a monumental miscalculation in assessing how much these third-party apps meant to our community. I didn't realize the extent to which they were woven into the fabric of our daily Reddit operations, particularly for our moderators.

In short, I messed up. I didn't fully understand the consequences of my decision, and now Reddit and its communities are bearing the brunt of it.

So, here's my TIFU, Reddit. It's a big one, and I'm still grappling with the fallout. But if there's one thing I know about this platform, it's that we're a community. We're in this together, and we'll figure it out together.

I'm listening. Let's talk.

TL;DR - Tried to unify Reddit under the official app, phased out third-party apps, caused chaos, possibly destabilized the platform, and learned a lesson about the value of diverse user experiences.

In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn’t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn’t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn’t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully’s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he’s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

EDIT THREE: Thanks for the precious metals! And holy shit! Front page?!?!"

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my “intentions” where with the video and that he’s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


TLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

Wife's 8 year old very large goldfish was passing away.  Had dropsy, was suffering, and was on the verge of death.   Wife and I looked into the symptoms and there was practically no hope of him making a recovery, so she asked me to euthanize him.  Looking into methods, it seemed pretty agreed upon that the most effective and quick way to euthanize a fish was blunt force trauma.

Now, when I was a kid my family were huge anglers, and I was designated as the fish killer when it was time to cook them.  Back then, I was told to slam them on the ground as hard as I could.  Well, my 8 year old body wasnt strong enough to kill them instantaneously so I had to do it multiple times.  Honestly it kind of fucked me up a little.

Flash forward to last night, I didn't want that happening again and I wanted it to be painless.  I asked my wife to leave the room because she was very upset and I chose to do the deed by putting the fish in a plastic grocery bag and slamming it on the counter as hard as I possibly could.

The poor fish was absolutely obliterated.  The force ripped open the bag and sprayed bits of what used to be a goldfish in every direction.  Told my wife to stay upstairs and she started getting suspicious so she comes down after 5 minutes and its just everywhere still.  On the counter, on the stove, on the fridge, on the freaking Christmas tree we still have up, I was still finding pieces of it this morning.  Wife was aghast and traumatized.  Cried until she went to bed.

TL;DR I euthanized my wife's dying fish quickly but in the most visually traumatizing way possible."

So. After lockdown ended in my country there’s been a huge sale at my local laser hair removal clinic and so I thought fuck it, I might as well go for it.
So I paid for my 10 visits and set off for the first one, a little nervous but excited for my new, hairless body. Now I decided it would be a great idea to get a full Brazilian, allll the way from front to back. Pretty normal right?

The lovely nurse comes in and gives me a brief heads up, explains how it all works sorta thing. So she leaves the room, leaving me to strip down. She comes back in, and decides that we are going to laser away the hair around my asshole first. All well and good right?

So the instructions I’m given are “lay on your right side, and use your left hand to pull up your bum cheek”

So here I am, lying on my side, hand pulling up my bum while this lady sticks a laser round my asshole. Now, on my left hand, I wear this gorgeous silver ring with a bright blue gem- it was handmade by my best friends boyfriend so it’s pretty unique.

So this lady saw my gorgeous ring, and decided to break the awkward silence with a “that’s a cute ring you have there”.

And of course, I happened to forget I was wearing the damn ring. It just made sense in my head that this nurse was complimenting the ring of my asshole. Yeah. I know.

So, still on my side, I tell her “thank you! It’ll be a lot nicer when it’s hairless lol”

Cue awkward laugh and then silence, until I realised that she was not, in fact, talking about my bum. Finished the rest of the appointment without speaking and dashed out of there as soon as possible. Still recovering.

TL;DR: my laser hair removal complimented my ring on my finger while doing laser hair removal on my asshole, and I thought she was saying I had a cute asshole

Edit: clarity

Edit: for everyone asking, this is the [ring](https://imgur.com/uqhSqij). It’s not super intricate but I was more impressed that it was handmade and the stone is pretty imo.
For everyone asking, my friends boyfriend has started a jewellery business and I bought the ring to support them- nothing funny going on there."

I was at a party and saw a girl across the room. She was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. I saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. A lot of women I know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.

A bit later, I got around to talking to her. I complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. She looked very confused, said “my skirt doesn’t have pockets, why would you think that?” I mentioned that I had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. Her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. What I thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.

I apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she’d never heard that comment before. I’m still dying inside though.

Let me start by saying it's important to note that whenever I cook hotdogs, I slice the package, take out a few, roll the rest back up in the plastic packaging, and fasten it all with some good old fashion elastic bands.

.. Today. I did not. 

I couldn't tell you why my dumb ass decided to just fold the plastic over a few times and place it back on the shelf, but here we are.

So my spouse comes running down in their few minutes between endless meetings to make their lunch quickly. We are the only two in our house, plus our little rescue dog who was a stray and an absolute MOOCH.

I mean, this dog will weave between your feet, eyes GLUED to the floor hoping for even a single speck of crum because woe is him he's never been fed a day in his life.

So we're all in the kitchen, I hear the fridge open, and it suddenly dawns on me in horror that my spouse is MOST DEFINITELY going to go for those hotdogs I wrapped like a dumbass.

I quickly turn around to say something, and my spouse in slow motion, wide-eyed stares at me as the hotdog package unrolls like a fruit-by-the-foot commerical and DOUSES my dog's entire skull in too-much-to-be-reasonable-in-one-fucking-package of hotdog water.

My dog lost his SHIT.

Like a Christian grandma with the second coming of Christ my dog just tears ass across the entire apartment with the worst case of the zoomies I think we've ever seen him have.

He proceeds to spend the next 15 mins singing our praises as the greatest humans alive as he rolls across every piece of furniture we own.

I'm talking every. Piece. Of. Furniture.

Now I don't hate hotdogs but the smell is weirdly  overpowering, and every time I sat down on something else all I can smell is godforsaken hotdogs.

My dog loves it though. And now I'm figuring out how to shampoo out hotdog water from my life. I have so many regrets.

TLDR: My dumb ass didn't seal a package of hotdogs properly and my spouse accidentally dumped hotdog water all over my dog's head and now I'm living in a hotdog smelling hellhole because my dog decided to excitedly roll on EVERYTHING we own. But at least he's having the best damn day of his life because of it. I probably hate hotdogs now.

Edit: Oh my gosh I'm trying to go through all the comments! I'm so glad so many of you got a good laugh out of this too! I don't know what awards do, but I want to thank you kind folks for being so cool. <3

I made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11"" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

I panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

So, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

TL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich."

My girlfriend came to visit and I guess I got distracted. My colleague who is, as mentioned in title, much smarter and more handsome than I am, seized this opportunity with gusto. He realized the shared computer was already logged in to reddit and immediately checked the username.

""Ahh... Justifire989, you have fucked up."" Immediately he knew where he should post first. Unfortunately, I am a lesser man and not subscribed to [r/TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/TIFU/), so he must have had to navigate here before beginning his tirade.

How he must have cackled, laughing at my puny karma score. Nearly 5 years on reddit and all I've amassed is 485 measly internet points. I imagine he must have checked all my posts and perhaps even read some of my comments. I started to worry... ""Wait...! Have I posted anything embarrassing?!"" As soon as this thought occurred to me I, of course, went to check my comment history, hoping I hadn't commented on anything in [r/furry\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/).

It was then that I began to wonder what else he may have done to my account while I was gone. Upon inspection, I found that he had subscribed to several subreddits I never would have subbed to. Who knew that [r/sounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/sounding/) is a thing? NSFW WARNING

Now I must begin the process of cleaning up my account. Or perhaps I'll simply discard it and start fresh. I just can't believe that I was dumb enough to let this happen while I was in sitting in the next room. Pray for me reddit, I've been bested by a better man.

TL;DR left my account signed in, colleague messed with me

UPDATE: My shift is over now so I'm headed out. OP called me a few minutes ago to say ""Well played."" when he started getting notifications on his phone from r/gayr4r. I feel I've done good work this night.

UPDATE 2: The first update and the post itself was made by my colleague, not the owner of the account. I see a few people are upset by the post that was made in r/gayr4r, but i assure you it was not made with any malicious intent nor was it made by me. Huge thanks to all the people who have given awards btw! I will make sure my colleague is provided with the satisfaction of knowing they did good."

Just feels so surreal, not necessarily panicking tho. I'm 23M and my female friend, whom I've known for the most part of my life is currently 22. 
I still remember us playing every day as little kids to hanging out almost everyday as teenagers, we often went on vacation together either with my or her parents. 
She was sort of like the sister I never had, and people now hearing that I got her pregnant feels almost like it's illegal. 

A few months ago, I was at her apartment both of us super drunk, and  yeah it somehow just happened. 
It was good, so I guess in the following weeks it accidentally happened quite often🤷🏽‍♂️.
We did use condoms , but she isn't on birthcontrol.
How the hell did she get pregnant. 
I know that there are a few, who even get pregnant on birthcontrol, but never thought it would happen to   us.
 She took 5 pregnancy tests and 1 week later went to the gynecologist, who comfirmed.
We both can't bring it on ourselves to abort the baby, so we're keeping it, we're financially stable so I don't think it would be a problem.

We're planning on telling our parents this evening, so akward since they've seen me grow up with her etc. The only one who's been shipping us since day one, was her grandma lol
. Still can't believe I'll have to spent 18 years of my life ,well it's not even 18 years it's a life commitment lol.

TL:DR Got my childhood friend🤰🏾🤰🏾

For those of you suggesting me to get a partenity test. : 
Yes she even told me she doesn't mind if I'm doubting that the child is mine, since the scenario is somehow unlikely. She told me she didn't sleep with another guy for the last 2 months. 
I'll be taking a paternity test, but I'm already 99% sure that child is mine.

*UPDATE*

Ok guys, I just went with her to her parents house, we actually wanted to go in the evening as I said, but the sooner the better I guess. 
I was really nervous ,her dad was working in the garden and her mom was cleaning around the house. After thirty minutes, everyone was gathered in the kitchen, so we thought a better opportunity wouldn't come. We told them and I could see the horror in their eyes lol. 

Idk they seemed kinda happy, but also shocked.
 Her mom started tearing up, so I guess she's either happy or disappointed.
 Her dad asked why we didn't tell them that we're ,,dating"" and my god that was such an akward moment because both of us didn't reply, (akward silence). 

They were asking a bunch of questions, and we even called her grandma telling her that her prediction was right. We made up an excuse and left, later on in the car she gave me a kiss and told me that she was proud of me, the whole drive her hand was resting on my thigh.
 Like does that mean she likes me?? I don't want to misinterpret anything to make things even worse. She's a very very kind person in general, so a bunch of guys always thought she liked them meanwhile she was only being nice.



Final UPDATE:

Okay Guys that'll be my final update, maybe if I remember I'll update in 9 months let's see. 

I discussed everything with her that needed to be discussed. We're planning on moving together when she's 6-7months pregnant, and we'll just see how it works. We both admitted to having feelings for eachother, so we'll just see were it goes, and leave our relationship how it is bestfriends, who live together and fuck I guess. 

Thanks for all the encouragment, this post shouldn't even be on TIFU anymore lol. I'm kinda excited on being a father.

And btw she's reading the comments......

*To clarify, apparently a few didn't get it,yes we are dating*

Bestfriend+ fuck= Dating




UPDATE:

Hey Guys, It‘s been awhile.

Almost forgot about this post. I‘ve received alot of nice messages, unfortunately I couldn‘t reply to all of them, since it were alot.

Anyways here is the Update, can‘t lie but those months were definetly more stressful and complicated than I expected them to be, considering Us being so young , nontheless it was all worth it the first time I held my little baby girl in my arms.

We didn‘t know the gender of our baby, since we wanted it to be a surprise.  When it comes to gender I don‘t necesseraly have a preference, but I‘d be lying if I said I never wanted to be a girl dad .

And for anyone wondering if she‘s my child , Yes she is haha, she even inherited  a family illness of mine (not saying that‘s good)

So I think the question most of you want answered is, what happened between me and my bestfriend ?

Well we did move in together , which was definetly a financial burden for us, and money in some months is really  tight, since we pay everything out of our own pocket. (I don‘t really like the idea of using our parents money, even if this would help us alot)

I found it sort of funny how people were actually believing that I was this oblivious, which I actually wasn‘t haha. Well maybe a bit, realizing she has been dropping hints, since we were like 16 .

But yeah there isn‘t much to Update, I feel like I mainly highlighted the negative consequences , but it‘s honestly pretty awesome too. 
The best feeling is to find a Bestfriend in a Lover, and I couldn‘t imagine loving anyone as much as I love her. 


That‘s it have a nice day :)"

The other night my wife and I were getting ready for bed and being kind of flirty. I had to use the restroom, so stayed downstairs while she went up to bed. While I was sitting on the toilet I got a text: ""Bring a bucket and a mop.""

Crap, one of my kids must have thrown up. I finished my toilet biz and went down to the basement to check the cleaning supplies. I found a bucket, but couldn't find a mop. i found one of those squeezy sponge things, but the sponge was missing. Figuring the vomit was probably congealing by this point, I just grabbed the bucket and a bunch of paper towels and ran upstairs.

I got to the upstairs bathroom and found no mess. I carried the cleaning supplies down to my kids rooms, but found no vomit. I went to our bedroom and found my wife lying on the bed. She asked what had taken me so long, and I said I couldn't find a mop, and where was the mess?

She started rolling around on the bed laughing. Suddenly I realized ""Bring a bucket and a mop"" was a line from ""WAP (Wet Ass Pussy)."" My wife had been in the mood, and I had spent 15 minutes looking for a mop in the basement. 

She was laughing so much that the mood was basically dead. 

TL;DR: My wife texted me a line from a Cardi B song to tell me she was in the mood. I thought she wanted me to bring cleaning supplies because a kid threw up."

TL;DR: watch the Apple memories of 2020 videos by yourself first. 

This happened about 45 minutes ago.

So... anyone that has an Apple device may have noticed they do these “memory videos” for 2020. Anyways, I had just discovered this feature and was watching it with my girlfriend. Slowly, other immediate family members joined around us after having heard the “chill” music played along the montage.

We saw some cute pictures of our pets, museums visits pre-COVID, my GF and I spotting deer, us decorating our new apartment, time spent at my moms house, visits to forest preserves, and other no contact activities we did this summer and fall.

Then it happened. About 3 minutes into the montage it shifted from a picture to a short clip of me sliding 2 fingers into my girlfriends vagina. Time froze. Someone said, “Oh my” in the tone of an antebellum age southern lady, and I whipped my phone down. People walked away, but a proverbial fly on the wall would have collided with the amount tensions in the air, which would require more than a knife to cut.

I’m now home laying in bed typing this and thinking about how 30 years from now, this is going to be one of those embarrassing memories that keep me up at night."

NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I’m probably going to be murdered.

I’m at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it’s over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I’m just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me 

“hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?”

 “Uhh what?”

 “Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me” 

to which the bartender said “oh you can trust Greg, he’s really nice”. Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

Girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical ‘meet a girl at a bar’ flirting shit. She asks if I’ve ever seen the show Years and Years. I say “no, but I’ve seen the band perform live”. So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. “Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT”. So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said

 “hey do you live close by?” 

“Yea, like half a mile”

 “we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car”

“Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now”

“That’s okay, I have pets too” (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

“I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow”

“That’s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I’ll have to go home”
“That’s fine” heh, cuz that’s all the time I’ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It’s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I’ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say “oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!” Which I’m excited about, because at this point I’m thinking to myself “hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid”

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn’t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to “watch HBOGO”.

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It’s fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an “oh no” thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I’ve slept with some strange in my time. I don’t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I’m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn’t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we’re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We’re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say “that was great we should do this again sometime”

“I don’t think so”

“What why?”

“I don’t think my husband would appreciate that”



I am speechless. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I’m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: “Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you’re at? Like, why didn’t you tell me that?”

Her: “idk, does it matter?”

“Uh yeah, I’d be pretty pissed if I was him”


Now I’ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I’ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn’t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn’t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don’t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: “we’re getting separated soon”

Me: “well you’re still fucking married to him”

“Yea but that’s okay”

“How is that okay?”

“He’s been..... abusive”


There’s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She’s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I’m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me “(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy” Btw, Evan Williams isn’t that bad when you’re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn’t like morning sex. I’m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can’t because she didn’t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn’t move it because “I didn’t know how to drive it” 

“Uhh, this is the third time we’ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car”

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she’ll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I’m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn’t think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That’s the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I’m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She’s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she’d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I’m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says “make it quick”

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I’m just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we’re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I’m like 

“I’ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on”
“No”

“What do you mean ‘no’? You can’t get in an Uber with your pussy out”

“No”


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That “arch” thing that women do when you’re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She’s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I’m starting to panic myself. Because I don’t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that’s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it’s her sending multiple texts saying “I’m so sorry babe” “idk where I’m at” “come get me”. And him saying “nope sorry” “this is on you” and “call 911”

That last one though. That’s what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I’m starting to worry about my safety. I don’t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that “you don’t know how to drive my car” with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn’t answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, “girl you need to get dressed, you’re gonna be going home”

Finally got her panties back on, I didn’t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can’t force her to go anywhere she didn’t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She’s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I’m like “I guess?”, and then I let them in.

She yells “are you fucking serious? You called the cops?” 
“Uh yea, you didn’t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that’s what I did”

The officer said to her “you’re on this man’s property, and he wants you to leave”

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what’s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn’t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer’s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she’s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. “I don’t think they’ll let you take that”

Cops didn’t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say “usually this is the other way around, ha”

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it’s over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she’s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn’t able to check. But I’m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven’t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I’m glad I could share this story with y’all. There might be more to come, but you’ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

Jk don’t do that.

And don’t stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house.

Edit: I’m not gonna change “que” to “cue” because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.

Edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa

Edit 3: her car is still there. Can’t get it towed, because it’s on a public street. I’m still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I’ll get to them when I can.

Edit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.

Edit 5: I’m still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor’s house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it’s front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she’s most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her “hey do you wanna get this car that’s in front of your house towed?” She said “no, noooo hehe” I’m like “yea, I’ll talk to y’all tomorrow” just wtf.

**UPDATE**

Since net neutrality is important for everyone who wants to keep enjoying a free internet - a group to which  most redditors belong - the mod team has decided to allow it:

---------------------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.

But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.

Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.

We also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join

ihkkqe,TIFU by making my Dad punch a stripper in GTA and tearfully ask God for forgiveness in front of my entire family.,70266,0.86,3029,2020-08-27 18:29:40,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ihkkqe/tifu_by_making_my_dad_punch_a_stripper_in_gta_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ihkkqe/tifu_by_making_my_dad_punch_a_stripper_in_gta_and/,self.tifu,0,14,,text,False,False,False,"I was encouraged to post this here from a comment I made elsewhere, even though it didn’t happen today, or even this decade, so mods please remove if it goes against the rules. It’s a very funny story though.


When I was young, my brothers and I snuck a copy of San Andreas into the house. We spent days holed up in our basement taking turns playing, and down there my parents didn’t bother us too much. In order to get tons of money for guns (we had yet to figure out my parents’ dialup password so cheats weren’t a thing for us yet), we would go to the strip club and stand on the stage, absorbing the money dudes threw at the women and just let the game sit for 10-20 minutes. We had to be careful though because sometimes the strippers would do a move and bump into CJ and the bouncers would shoot the place up. One day while I was playing my mom yelled down to the basement at us to get ready, we’re going to Pizza Hut. In a stroke of genius, I drove to the GTA strip club, got on the stage, and then turned the TV off and we left. It was to be the heist of the century.

My dad, however, was at church at this time, practicing for a gospel concert he was singing in. He always filmed the practices so he could take notes at home upon playback, and this time was no different. While my mom and brothers and I were still at the Hut, he arrived at home and plugged his camcorder into the VCR. We had just one VCR, and it was connected to the basement TV.

Back at the Hut, my mom gets a phone call. She puts her napkin down and slowly looks around the table at us and says ‘ooookay’ a few times into the phone in this really calculating, specific way that she always did when she knew us kids were in trouble before we did. Naturally, it was at this point that we kids knew we were in trouble. For what, though, we didn’t know.

After a very quiet minivan ride, we get home and my mom says “Boys why don’t we go down to the basement. Your dad wants to show you his gospel practice downstairs.” It was then at THIS point we knew why we were in trouble. So we drag our feet down the stairs, and lo and behold, my dad is sitting on the couch, TV on, a stripper’s polygonal titties swung stiffly back and forth onscreen to En Vogue’s “My Lovin’”, with CJ standing mere inches away, collecting money.

My dad starts in, “boys I don’t even know where to begin. This PlayStation was a blessing to you for Christmas and this is how you repay us? By breaking our trust??” He is holding the controller up now, gesticulating with it. “Here I am, practicing to bring glory to God, and-“ but he was cut off, as he inadvertently squeezed the controller, causing CJ to punch the stripper.

My entire family stands in silence, watching together as the bouncers in the strip club shoot the place up for what seems like an eternity. After the shooting stops, and CJ appears in front of the hospital, I look back and see my mom silently weeping into her hand. I look at my dad as a single tear rolls down his cheek and he prays under his breath. After another eternity of silence, without a word, my dad bends down, disconnects the PlayStation, walks back to the family computer, disconnects it, goes to his car and drives away. For the next four months he kept the PS2 and PC locked in his office at work.

It’s one of my favorite memories of growing up. I miss my brothers.

TL;DR: Wasn’t allowed to play GTA growing up, of course got caught playing it, my dad interrupted his own lecture by accidentally punching a stripper and immediately asked for God’s forgiveness.


EDIT: Thanks so much for the response, I’m glad I could spread some laughs with this story! I just want to clarify that my parents weren’t crazy at all, so no need to insult them. I love them so much, they just got overzealous and dramatic from time to time. I had a really great childhood with two loving and involved parents who tried really, really hard to live and raise our family by their convictions. It just doesn’t always work out for everyone involved, like in this case, but it made for a great story that we can all laugh about now. I’m very much an atheist and my parents know it, but we still get along great :)

EDIT 2: Also my brothers aren’t dead, we’re all just spread out across the country now! I don’t get to see them very much anymore, that’s all!

EDIT 3: Alright now I’m not being so nice. I’m an atheist, but all you other atheist weirdos calling my parents crazy are weird. I hesitate to inform people I’m atheist because of houseplants like you. So self-informed on my life because you’re drunk on your own over-inflated, homuncular ideas about spirituality in people’s personal lives, it’s no wonder r/atheism isn’t a default sub anymore. Look how you’re acting, trying to tell me “bro you need to get out of there.” The story is over a decade old, apparently none of you can read! I shouldn’t be surprised at what I’m reading! However, if you do still feel inclined to let the pea that rolls around your empty head, whose sound you mistake for a competent thought, inform you of some truly transcendent comment in which you consider calling my parents whack jobs and nuts, it says way more about you and your small-mindedness in acting like you know better just because you have an internet connection and a lifetime full of trauma on your own.

The fuck up is that I decided to try drawing what I saw over my bed last night. And then sent a picture to my mom.

Now, my parents are hella catholic. Like, homeschooled for 6 years and went to church every day catholic. Like, when things go bad in life my dad wholeheartedly believes it’s the devil actively attacking us so we lose our faith. Which explains their reaction when I showed them [this picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/NPknvMj).

Cue the panicked phone call from my parents who now believe the devil visits me in my sleep. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with them trying to find a bible or a rosary so my mom could sleep without worrying my soul would be stolen. They want me to talk to a priest and get my house blessed and use holy water every time I enter. The next time I visit them, I may end up in an impromptu exorcism. Wish me luck.

b8mhmf,TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,67938,0.91,4283,2019-04-02 23:19:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b8mhmf/tifu_by_thinking_divorce_was_an_april_fools_gag/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b8mhmf/tifu_by_thinking_divorce_was_an_april_fools_gag/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

*Edit*

Wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*Edit 2*

I don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names 

*Edit 3.0*

Ok it's been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*Edit 4.0*

Uhh this post is getting deleted. It's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*Edit 5*

Final edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.

Thanks for everyone who said I'm not the asshole. I may have autism, but I'm not an asshole. 

*Edit 6*

Once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

Give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. I've got it, I've just got to convince my wife to release it. "

So today I woke up and had really painful cramps due to the deadly woman’s monthly cycle, mixed with some spiced chicken that hadn’t set right in my belly all night. I go to the toilet about 3 times before work this morning but it’s eased off a bit so take tablets, grin and bear it then leave for work. 

Now my job is a working within the Prison System and escorting prisoners to certain places, including courts. This is where it all went downhill. 

I had to escort this prisoner over to the witness box and stand next to her (open court) So I do my usual but my tummy has started to really hurt again. I’m trying my absolute best to put off a fart which I know is brewing but can’t hold it much longer. So I do a really silent one and pat myself on the back thinking I had got away with it....

That is until the Prisoner starts coughing and retching and shouting, ‘what the fucks that?!’  I quickly realise what it must be but can’t admit to such a foul, putrid smell so start crinkling my nose as well and gagging. The admin clerk walks slightly closer and retches so hard she had to swiftly put her head in the bin. By this point it’s getting loud and chaos is starting to ensue (not what you want in court, in front of the District Judge) 

He quickly tells me to take the prisoner back over to the closed dock and states it must be the pipes. He stands down the whole of court and makes maintenance come in to check all pipes for any leaks, cracks, ANYTHING which could of made that smell happen.  Prisoner still has watery eyes, Im pretending to gag and the clerk is sipping water next to a bucket. 

TLDR: So yeah, court was stood down for over an hour whilst it was searched for the cause of a smell. Not knowing the cause was back down in the cells, hanging her head in shame and regaling to her co-workers about the ‘leaky pipe’ upstairs."

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

Well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).

Edit: Yes, I accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" My b, my b. "
iijr5m,TIFU - I accidentally revealed my boyfriend's mom's infidelity,67129,0.9,3916,2020-08-29 06:55:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iijr5m/tifu_i_accidentally_revealed_my_boyfriends_moms/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iijr5m/tifu_i_accidentally_revealed_my_boyfriends_moms/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory this story actually happened about a year ago: I (18F at the time) was dating a boy named, Jacob (18 M at the time). His father (early 60s) was a mechanic, and his mom (mid 50s) was a SAHM. They were a pretty typical white suburban family in the south and had asked Jacob if they could meet me even though we had only been dating for a month.

At the dinner, I met his mom, dad, older brother, older sister, and her newborn daughter. The dinner went well and I was chatting about my volunteer work at my college's blood drive, to which his father explains that his doctor told him he was O negative and a universal blood donor. My boyfriend mentions he is also O, but his siblings casually mention they are both AB. I don't think anything of it because my bf had mentioned that his mom was married once before and was widowed. The following conversation went like this:

Me: Oh that's really cool. You're a really rare blood type. If you don't mind me asking: is your mom's blood type A and your dad's B or your dad's A and mom's B?

OS (older sister): What do you mean? He's O. \*Gesturing to my bf's father\*

Me: Oh I know. I was just asking about your bio father, but of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

\*I notice his mom get really pale, and it was in that moment I realized I fucked up\*

OB (older brother): What do you mean bio father?

Me: I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

\*Jacob's dad got real quiet and looking at his wife's face. He knew instantly. I look over to Jacob who I think was starting to put the full picture of what was happening together\*

Jacob's dad: Are you saying they're not my biological kids? Because my wife swore up and down in marriage counseling (By ""Marriage Counseling"" they mean with a pastor) that they were my kids and she would never cheat on me. (yeah... turns out she never had any kids from her previous marriage)

Jacob's Mom: I would never cheat on you. OS and OB are your kids.

Jacob's Dad: OP, why do you think they're not my kids?

I tried to excuse myself because it was very clear the cat was out of the bag, and with a quick google search from my boyfriend he starts cussing out his mom. She starts to sob and apologizes over and over again. And I am forced to explain 9th-grade biology to his father about the fact that the only kids he could have produced were with the blood type: O, A or, B; but absolutely not AB. Jacob was the only one with the possibility of being his son.

They all start screaming at one another. OS eventually leaves because her newborn is screaming too. His mom goes and locks herself in the bedroom. His older brother follows her screaming asking who his real father is. My boyfriend is trying to figure out if his dad still wants to *be* their father. I eventually have a friend come pick me up.

Yeah... we broke up shortly after but not after figuring out that none of the kids produced from the marriage were his (Edit: They found out via paternity tests, for sure weren't his kids) and they divorced soon after.

**TL;DR I accidentally revealed that my boyfriend's mom was unfaithful by pointing out the fact that his older siblings who both had the blood type AB could not have been biologically related to their O negative father**

Edit: For those asking how they knew their blood types -- Jacob donated blood for the blood drive at our school. His sister just had a baby so she was probably informed during pregnancy. Jacob's dad was told by his doctor for (probably) underlying medical reasons I don't know (I wasn't ever really close to his family after that for obvious reasons) and I don't know how his brother knew.

Edit/PSA: Reading through the comments I have discovered many of you don't know your blood type: **Go find out your blood type! It can save your life in an emergency!** If you are parents find out your children's blood type. If you discover you are not biologically related to one or either of your parents. I am very sorry, but you should still know your blood type and I would suggest some therapy."

Also, throwaway since I don't want IRL friends finding my account

So there's a video going around of the Wake vs. Duke football game of a girl leaning in to kiss a guy and him not returning the kiss, and looking away. It's on r/therewasanattempt, and currently on r/popular, as well as trending on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.

That guy is me.

I have gotten texts from high school friends I haven't talked to in years, random college classmates, and my sister and mom who have all seen that video, and I'm gonna take this brief moment of internet fame to explain what actually happened.

Basically, I've been talking to this girl for a while and we just started dating about a week ago. I tell her she should come to the Wake game since we are undefeated and will probably win. She says yes. We go with a group of friends, and we are having a great time. Throughout the game we are flirting, hugging, kissing a little bit, etc. We also do this thing where one of us leans in for a kiss, and the other person leans away, which is an inside joke between the two of us. So, we do our little inside joke thing, and unbeknownst to us, we are being recorded.

After the game, I find I'm on the wake forest old row Instagram page, and within the hour I'm on the official old row page. Then, I'm on TikTok, Twitter, and apparently Reddit too.

Just to clarify a few things:

1. She did not get rejected, we were just playing around
2. We did not know we were being recorded
3. If you want proof, check our TikTok accounts (hhhhggggllll and sandx.lop)
4. It was also her first (maybe last?) college football game

Anyway, the internet is full of horrible people and I haven't done any work this weekend, so I'm gonna go do that now. Peace

TL;DR I didn't kiss a girl at a football game and now I'm paying the price.

edit: I'm using a throwaway so people don't read my post history, not to hide my identity, for all those asking."

I would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

Came with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It’s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

I’m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit ‘coffee shops’ and buy and smoke joints. 

Had a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

In a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...’did I ditch that joint’?

At this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

‘Sir, do you have anything in your pockets’ says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I’m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

Go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I’m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I’m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

‘Sir, empty your pocket please’? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

I’m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, ‘oh god. I’m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...’
‘HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY’! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

I’m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

Customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, ‘Don’t worry Sir! Don’t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won’t be last! I’m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can’t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home’. 

I almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he’d taken joint off me....and that was it...

I’m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You’re the best. I’m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

TLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. 

Edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

Edit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I’m from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I’ve just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, ‘joints’. 

Edit 3-Schiphol doesn’t frisk as matter of routine, yes I get it. Thanks for correction."
uwtkqz,TIFU by sending a call from the International Space Station to voicemail,65409,0.91,1488,2022-05-24 21:03:58,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uwtkqz/tifu_by_sending_a_call_from_the_international/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uwtkqz/tifu_by_sending_a_call_from_the_international/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"This happened two days ago (Sunday). A friend of mine is currently on his second mission to the ISS. I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said “Us Gov.” I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. “Crap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn’t?!” I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all ""Don't answer it!"" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was “You probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.” I know he’ll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.

TL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said “Us Gov” so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.

Edit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam…orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that’s a common occurrence :)"
n8b1hb,TIFU - Forgetting that to Americans the f-word rarely means sexual intercourse in general usage,65384,0.84,2512,2021-05-09 15:24:48,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/n8b1hb/tifu_forgetting_that_to_americans_the_fword/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/n8b1hb/tifu_forgetting_that_to_americans_the_fword/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"**UPDATE SEE BELOW**

Background: I'm an American living in Germany.

Obligatory this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago.

I’ve finally made a close friend here - a neighbor and she is my conversation partner. I help her English she helps my German. She and my wife are close friends too. 

A little background, I joke around a lot and am always messing with ppl, etc. She knows this.

So, over the last year we’ve seen each other more often due to Corona and we’re able to talk more and I’m getting more comfortable being myself. 

A couple of weeks ago I said something to her in a joking manner and she took it seriously. My expectation - I followed up with, “I’m just fucking with you.” She gives me another look, a little concerned. So I said, I’m just joking. 

I leave it be, think nothing of it. 

A week later we’re talking again and she asked, “What do you mean you were fucking with me, like in your dreams?”

It’s a this point I realized that when Americans use the word “fuck” or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse. 

To Germans, it ALWAYS means sexual intercourse in all of its variants. 

I was a bit embarrassed as was she. But once I explained it, a lightbulb went on over her head and Netflix started making more sense to her.

So she's been practicing the proper use of the f-word since with me as her coach - what else am I going to do? The other day she wrote to me, ""I like fucking you."" As much as that would be nice, I had to correct her to ""I fucking like you.""

I told her she's not ready to use the word in the wild, yet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I forgot that when Americans use the word fuck or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse. Embarrassment ensues and good cultural exchange.

**UPDATE**

Not all Germans have the same level of understanding of idiomatic English. My neighbor is trying to improve her English and in the past year it has progressed far further than my German has. That said, she grew up in the 70s and 80s and learned English in gymnasium and didn't really use it except in passing for 20 years. My wife fully understands how she could have had this misunderstanding as she, herself, had a hard time when she first moved to the USA in the 1990s understanding how fuck was being used to modify everything. My neighbor is NOT stupid, so I don't appreciate that. The reason she wrote what she wrote in the text is because we were joking around and she was trying to use a variant of fuck in a sentence.

Also, to all of the Germans out there taking offense, stop. Part of story telling is to take the truth and make it more interesting, so saying things like ""To Germans it ALWAYS means..."" is a literary device to make the point POP and set the stage for what's to come next.

All stories have embellishments, this one too. But it's not all that embellished. "
cw6h0y,TIFU by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans,65324,0.92,2063,2019-08-27 21:32:49,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cw6h0y/tifu_by_trying_to_gift_my_bf_some_sweet_undies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cw6h0y/tifu_by_trying_to_gift_my_bf_some_sweet_undies/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,False,False,False," About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call ""Ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

We live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

I ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

One small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).

While carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!

My heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.

I probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. 

Here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

My punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

A romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?"" He said. ""That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!""

Now he's started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, ""Gotta tie this shoe!"" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

One more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

I guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

If we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

TL;DR tried to hide an email receipt for some fancy underoos, found out about an incoming engagement ring, now I'll never get a husband"

It was later than usual so I sent the wife up on the golf cart with the kids and in-laws to get them some dinner while I covered up the boat.  About halfway through covering up the boat, I notice someone halfway across the cove in the water all on their own and she appeared to maybe be in distress.  She wasn’t making progress swimming one way or the other and occasionally going underwater.  There were people on the opposite shoreline yelling at her but I couldn’t tell what they were saying. I yell asking if she needs help and she says yes.  I call my wife and tell her to come down on the cart, someone is in the water and needs help, I’m going in. I might need help getting the person out. I put on a life jacket and grab the throw cushion from the boat.  I swim out to the person and pass off the throw cushion.  She appears out of breath.  First thing she says to me is “I’m topless”.  I responsd with “umm ok, but are you okay?”. 
I also immediately think to myself:
1. My friends are never going to believe this
2. What is my wife going to think with a topless woman swimming to shore with me

 She then says she’s running from her boyfriend who is “messed up”.  She also asks if it’s shallow enough to touch yet.  It wasn’t going to be. I help her to the dock where my wife meets us.  She tells my wife “I’m sorry but I don’t have a shirt on”.  Again my wife just asks if she’s okay and she tells us the boyfriend story again.  Sure enough as she gets out of the water she is topless.  But she is carrying a white Tshirt that she quickly throws on. She then immediately begins running to shore.  At the same time we notice a pontoon cruising towards our dock yelling at us.  At first I think this must be her boyfriend chasing her and we are in the middle of some domestic dispute.  They quickly get closer and I realize it’s two sheriff deputies who flagged a pontoon down to carry them across the lake.  As they are jumping onto the dock we notice the girl had just jumped into our golf cart and was riding away on it.   Apparently she was allegedly involved in a string of burglaries and the “boyfriend” she was running away from was the cops.  I had unknowingly aided her swim across the lake to escape and she used our golf cart as getaway. The cops chased her for awhile through the night tracking her down once more but she escaped again.  We looked all day for the golf cart today with no luck.  I notified insurance if the theft around lunch. About an hour ago someone notified us through social media that it was parked behind a house in a neighborhood over.  So we recovered the cart and it seems ok.  They put more warrants out for the suspect and are still looking for her.

TLDR: thought I was saving a topless woman in distress but unknowingly aided a crook in escaping the police."
gw1pos,"TIFU By Swimming in a Florida Spring. when I close my eyes, I can still hear the screams....",65121,0.92,1466,2020-06-04 01:47:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gw1pos/tifu_by_swimming_in_a_florida_spring_when_i_close/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gw1pos/tifu_by_swimming_in_a_florida_spring_when_i_close/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"This was a few years ago.  Took the family to Ginnie Springs, a beautiful Florida water spot for a day of swimming and a little picnic.  So as I was swimming in the crystal clear water, watching my son floundering around in his water wings, and just having a good ol time, my son suddenly stopped, pointed at the water and said ""Look daddy, a lizard!""

I looked over and saw that no, it was NOT a lizard that was swimming over to us, it was a snake. After a quick examination, I realized that this was a Water Moccasin, and a large one at that, heading right for us!

So Yelling for my son to back away, I waded out to grab him and drag him back to shore. The snake was making a beeline for us, which is weird because most of the time they avoid human contact. I started to splash water at it, trying to slow it down enough so I could reach the shore before it got too close. 

So as I was backing up, slapping water at a poisonous snake with one hand and dragging a laughing child (who had no idea what was going on) with the other, I reached close enough to the shoreline to grab a branch that had fallen from a tree. It was long and pretty sturdy. It was perfect for what needed to be done.

So as the snake got in close, I went all caveman on it and bashed it a dozen times with the branch. It worked. The snake started to float away, dead as a doornail. I then realized that all the people swimming around in this water would not take too kindly to bumping into a four foot dead moccasin, so using the branch, I launched the snake for a stretch of woods off to my right.

Well, I guess the snake was not balanced right on the branch, and I was full of Adrenalin, so instead of the woods, the snake flew high into the air, drifting off to the right where **PLOP**. It landed square on a picnic table.  To make matters worse, it landed on a pile of shoes that a girl scout troop had left when they went wading in the water.

""Oh Crap!"" was all i could think, as I began to quickly swim across the spring to remove the snake from the table, but as I was swimming, I heard them.. the giggles and laughter of little 12 year old girls returning to get their shoes. I stopped cold. I was too late. I began to swim away, trying to hide myself as I saw the first curly haired head approach the table. There was laughing, there was chatting and talking... then there was a pause.

And that is when the screaming started.

If you have never heard a dozen 12 year old girls scream in horror as they saw a large, bloody snake draped across their shoes, I cannot even begin to explain the sound. Even as i dove underwater, I heard the screaming. 

Sometimes... at night... I still hear the screams.

&#x200B;

TLDR- Killed a snake, launched it with a stick across a table filled with 12 year old girls shoes. the screams... they still echo in those woods to this very day."

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

This lack of filter sometimes has the tendency to get people into trouble because not all the information is provided, even when it's meant harmlessly. 

My parents are a bit older (prime ""Ok, Boomer"" age). I was talking to my Dad the other day on the phone because his birthday dinner was a few days later. I asked how mom was doing and he goes on to tell me a story how my Mom and Aunt (Karen) were at the store and the cashier made a mistake. My Aunt went off on the cashier and asked to see the manager. My Mom was mortified and tried to calm her down but she wasn't having it. 

I then mentioned to my Dad, ""That's such a Karen thing."" He goes on to say ""Yeah, your Aunt does that a lot."" I tell him, ""That's the funny part, the Karen meme is a real thing. It's when an entitled (typically white) woman gets angry at the smallest mistake and asks for the manager."" 

My Dad found this hilarious and I explain in more detail. I send him a few links to sites explaining it online. He finds all of this hilarious and she even has the Karen hairstyle. This sends him down the google images rabbit hole and the next few days he sends me random meme's of ""Karens"" doing Karen stuff adding ""Your Aunt did this last week"" or ""I think this one is about your Aunt."" This leads up to his birthday dinner with extended family. 

My Dad's birthday dinner is going well. Everyone is having a good time, good food, and drinks, etc. Suddenly my Aunt (sitting a few seats down from me) leans forward and loudly shouts down the table ""Hey [my name], what's this whole thing about making a meme about me?"" I respond ""Huh?"" She then tells me my Dad sent her all these memes about things she's done. He didn't give her the context that it's a generic meme from the internet and what it's about. Now, my Aunt thinks I made all these memes about her real life events.

At this point, the entire family thinks I created this meme on the internet about my Aunt's antics in public. There is a back and forth discussion about it being really rude of me. She's pulling a Karen and starts chewing me out. Meanwhile, I am looking at my Dad like W-T-F, back me up here. My Dad finally steps in to say that this is just a random viral internet thing and that I didn't make these up behind my Aunt's back. 

Even after explaining, she's a bit irritated. It is apparent she is embarrassed that she is so much like a ""Karen"" and couldn't tell the difference between the stories online and her own encounters. 
 
TL;DR: I told my Dad about the Karen meme because my Aunt is named Karen and acts like a ""Karen."" My Dad sends my Aunt memes he found, my aunt think I made them about her, she bring it up at my Dad's birthday dinner, and pulls a Karen on me.

She was laughing hysterically at quite a few! So much so that it caused her to let one rip (fart) more than once.

This was obviously not intentional which made it both hilarious and adorable. After the third time it happened she said  “I’m really gassy”. I took this as an opportunity to quickly press down on her stomach which then almost immediately triggered an enormous fart.

I lost it! It was so funny and I could feel the vibration as the pressure caused her to fart again and again. I couldn’t help myself and kept doing it. 

This is how I f**ked up.

After a few successful attempts I tried for a final push. I wanted to end it on a huge one. It was so funny and she was laughing so much!!

I pushed down and nothing. So.. I pushed again but this time MUCH harder... 

Now this is where I should note that she was wearing nothing but one of my T-shirt’s. Hence she had no underwear on.

My girlfriend sharted. She sharted and then had a SEVERE follow through... all over our bed.

She was mortified. It went from pure joy to absolute chaos and horror... she was just staring at me blankly like she had just killed someone..

I didn’t know what to do as she went quiet.. my legs covered in shit..I stared right back, gently held her hands and walked together to the shower without looking back at the bed or down at my legs.. we didn’t say a word.

I cleaned up my legs before leaving her to clean herself up. She made me promise not to go into the bedroom.

I adore her completely. She looked so scared when I left her in the shower and wouldn’t let me clean up despite my offering to do so.

Eventually, I walked in the bedroom to help. She was so apologetic although I assured her that it’s completely fine.

She burst out laughing when I said to her “Don’t worry. You will always be my little shit”.

Don’t worry guys. All good! Luckily I have thick skin and can take a lot of shit ;) I adore her. 


TL;DR - Pushed my girlfriend to hard for shits and giggles. Ended up getting more shit than giggles!"

I created a twitch account and started watching all of live stream and even commented a coupled of times. omg this made him so happy!! he came running into the room to tell me all about it. he has no idea its me. he now gets so excited to play and stream because he believes that even though he only has one person watching, that is one person that believes in him. COVID has been really hard on all of us and this is the first time that I have seen him this excited in like a longggg time. now I feel like there is no way I can tell him its me.

ugh I feel awful, I had good intentions and now I feel like I am hiding something from him and I am scared that he will be so disappointed to find out that this one fan was me all along.

coi5uk,TIFU by trying to tell my parents about Jeff Epstein's suicide.,63815,0.84,2153,2019-08-10 19:09:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/coi5uk/tifu_by_trying_to_tell_my_parents_about_jeff/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/coi5uk/tifu_by_trying_to_tell_my_parents_about_jeff/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"This literally just happened and I've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

I was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and I happened to see news articles that Jeffrey Epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. Now, my family and I all talk about current events and politics. My parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so I figure I'll go tell them the news.

Their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. I walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. As I hear my mom say ""Do ya mind??"", I immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. All the while trying to burn away what I just saw.

They leave for the weekend at noon, and I have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

TL;DR: Jeff Epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.

Edit: In one hour on a throwaway, I get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? Huh.

Anyway, back on the ""Fuck Jeff Epstein"" train."

&#x200B;

I'm sitting there, doing my sit-down-business because boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. I've just finished the dirty work and I'm about to perform my ablutions, but I delay it because it's a ""paid to shit"" thing, dicking around on reddit a bit. At this point I feel something jump onto my balls. Something I had never hoped I would ever experience, let alone talk about on the internet.

&#x200B;

I shriek. Not a barbarian shriek. Not a viking shriek. Psycho-Shower-Scene shriek.

&#x200B;

A huntsman spider has crawled out of the toilet bowl and jumped onto my low hanging fruit.

&#x200B;

I bat the spider off, smacking myself in the nuts, keel over in pain.

&#x200B;

Spider dead. Good news.

&#x200B;

My banshee wail has not gone unanswered. Bad news.

&#x200B;

Someone comes into the bathroom and knocks on the stall door. ""Mate are you alright? Have you fallen over? I'll call an ambulance.""

&#x200B;

""NO. FINE. EVERYTHING. IS. GOOD. JUST SLIPPED. FINE. NO NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.""

&#x200B;

I flush the world's smallest sexual predator to try and retain some of my inner pride, wash my hands, and make the very VERY long walk back to my desk.

&#x200B;

My manager's desk isn't too far from the bathrooms, and he comes up to me afterwards.

&#x200B;

""What happened in there, is everyone alright?""

&#x200B;

""Yeah... Everyone's... FINE.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And then I make the dumbest deciscion of my life, and explain to him what had happened. And the audacity of the man; he LAUGHS. He laughs so hard he has to sit down so he doesn't hurt himself.

&#x200B;

His hyena/kookaburra hybrid laughter has gotten the attention of some of the other members of my team. They're looking to get in on the funny, funny joke.

&#x200B;

Bossman wheezes ""GET... GET HIM TO... TELL THEM HOLY SHIT""

&#x200B;

And because I'm incredibly susceptible to peer pressure, I tell them. Like a fucking gimp.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna skip past most of the laughter because it went on for what felt like forever.

&#x200B;

I come back from lunch, and Bossman and two other members of my team come up to me as I'm sitting back down at my desk getting ready to get back to work. Bossman is holding a piece of paper.

&#x200B;

""Look. We need to have a chat about something. I've brought two of your friends in the team as support since this is obviously not something that's easy to talk about.""

&#x200B;

I am confused.

&#x200B;

""I have a blank HR report here. I'll need you to fill this out. You confided into me that you were sexually harassed in the workplace and it's my duty of care to make sure the 'POOPITRATOR' is brought to justice. Under the space where it says 'which hand did they assault you with', just put x8. We understand this is a traumatic experience for you and I just want you to know that every resource we have is here for you.""

gn3kar,TIFU by slapping the absolute clot out of my girlfriend,63243,0.9,2051,2020-05-20 08:41:37,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gn3kar/tifu_by_slapping_the_absolute_clot_out_of_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gn3kar/tifu_by_slapping_the_absolute_clot_out_of_my/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"Girlfriend was about to take a shower, and was seriously getting her hustle on getting out of her kit. She was making proper fucking haste for the tub, and I realised that all her defences were down.

Note: in my household, bare asses are hunted down and terminated with EXTREME prejudice.

I went for the Mother of All Ass Slaps. It was completely undefended territory, and I was intending to create a masterpiece. I was aiming for that initial dull *thwack* and the resultant perfect, satisfying vibrato, complete with concentric assflesh ripples *à la* that glass of water in Jurassic Park.

I made contact, and immediately discovered the reason for her hurry.

My girlfriend was on the second day of her period.

I learned the term ‘arterial spray’ from Dexter, and have now found its southern companion. I was reeling. She was reeling. Did I say ‘Bloody Mary’ three times in the mirror before spanking dat ass? I couldn’t remember. Fortunately, its trajectory as such was so that most of the menstruation creation spattered handily in the bathtub – including The Clot: a penny-sized curd of uterine lining best visually described as Gumby’s aborted cousin.

Unfortunately, our bathmat did not escape entirely unharmed. Its cleaning was immediately and firmly relegated to ‘boyfriend work’.

By the way, has anyone seen The Thing (1982)? Good movie.

Tl;dr: slapped dat ass as my girlfriend made a beeline for the shower; blood. So much blood."
p6mnew,TIFU by angering a sitting U.S. Congressman on Facebook — to the extent he challenged me to fight him when he comes to my state (Alaska) next year. I accepted before giving it any thought.,63189,0.9,5908,2021-08-18 13:22:45,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p6mnew/tifu_by_angering_a_sitting_us_congressman_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p6mnew/tifu_by_angering_a_sitting_us_congressman_on/,self.tifu,0,17,,text,False,False,False,"This all started earlier tonight when I replied to one of his posts, calling him out for frequently lying (as so many politicians are wont to do) and capping it off by calling him a traitor. We then had a brief back and forth and he laid down the challenge. 

He wants us to go at it either in a ring or in a dojo. I told him to message me before he gets here so we can actually make this happen. 

I’m not sure if I’m in over my head or not but I’m not about to back down. I have a surface-level amount of training from my time in the infantry and in law enforcement but he has a similar background. While I highly doubt he will follow through, I better start legitimately training just in case.

Never in a million years did I think he’d respond let alone challenge me to an actual fisticuffs like we’re in the 1800’s but here we are. 

I can provide redacted screenshots in the comments for proof if mods allow it or I can provide them with screenshots if they want to verify. 

TL;DR - I pissed off a sitting U.S. Congressman enough that he challenged me to fight him in 2022 and I accepted.

EDIT: Welp, this blew up. Just woke up. I will read through all comments as time allows today and reply where I can. I just posted a couple of redacted screenshots in the comments. Thanks for the encouragement, fellow Americans and random fellow humans around the world.

EDIT 2: As usual, internet sleuths have figured it out. The congressman is Clay Higgins. Do your thing, internet. Maybe we can find a way to use this to raise money for charity even if he backs down. PR folks, message me. Not sure how to proceed but I’m willing to train and make this happen for a good cause.

EDIT 3: Here’s a quick update: I have had a couple of PR folks and trainers reach out to me and we will see where all of this goes. Realistically, I suspect Clay will continue to ignore all this as numerous people mentioned that is his MO and apparently this isn’t his first time challenging people to a fight on social media. But I will train anyway as it’ll be fun and good for me. For those who were wondering, I was a Republican until around 2012 when I shifted left of center a bit and became an independent. I joined the Democratic Party in 2020. I hope someday the GOP shifts back toward moderate but I won’t hold my breath. We really need more Adam Kinzinger’s in that party. Anyway, it’s going to take *days* to read through these comments and reply to some so bear with me. Thanks for the support."
a2pdlw,TIFU by making a girl I like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and I almost lost my job.,63091,0.89,2454,2018-12-03 20:28:40,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,,False,"So there's this girl I like at work, and we're really good friends. We're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. For some reason I (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""Well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? DAB!"" and promptly did the deed. Also I have ability to cry on demand so I just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

She finds it funny. Extremely funny. So funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. After a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. I asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. Freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, I start to reach for my phone.

And in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. I only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying I think she's having a seizure and I'm calling 911. Fortunately, I was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

Turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. Whoops.

TL;DR. Made I joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. She ended up in the hospital and I almost lost my job.

bgvmdp,TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.,62803,0.9,2232,2019-04-24 20:28:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bgvmdp/tifu_by_submitting_hardcore_furry_erotica_instead/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bgvmdp/tifu_by_submitting_hardcore_furry_erotica_instead/,self.tifu,0,12,,text,True,False,False,"So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't “work”. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work.

Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.

Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want's to talk” and I want to die.

&#x200B;

obligatory update:

Well, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

I ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.

He had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""Customer\_Commission\_2nd draft.doc""). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

I gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

Like I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown."

The attention hasn’t been exactly positive and this hasn’t been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it’s now sadly ended. 

I didn’t expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. 

There aren’t many 25 year old Tyler Life’s who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.

Unfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn’t happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. 

What made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.

Her father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. 

We are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn’t have it and backtracked.

I don’t think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn’t like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn’t force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it’s different. 

I know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I’ll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share. 

TL;DR Made Reddit post and finished our relationship"

It all happened so fast.

I see a dick. A hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

And then it's cumming.  

And after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and I see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
I just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. This dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

He moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. I'm not going to give it back. I'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. I'm going to burn it with fucking fire.

d659eb,TIFU by letting my son take my wife’s menstrual cup for show and tell,61519,0.9,2208,2019-09-19 04:41:34,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d659eb/tifu_by_letting_my_son_take_my_wifes_menstrual/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d659eb/tifu_by_letting_my_son_take_my_wifes_menstrual/,self.tifu,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"My wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. Sometime over the weekend I noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it’s versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

Fast forward to this morning and as we’re getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it’s show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. My son looks happy so I figure he’s not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he’s proud of. 

Our conversation:

Teacher: Ben’s show and tell was...interesting. 

Me: Yea! It’s cool right? We’ve been playing with that thing for days. 

Teacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?

I start to panic- oh shit it’s not a toy...

Teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

I get confused. 

Teacher notes my confusion: it’s um, used to collect menstrual blood...

I’m still confused...

Teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

Me: It just...stays in there? 

She nods. 

Me: are you sure? I don’t think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

Teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

We’re both clearly uncomfortable. 

Me: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


My wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

TL:DR thought my wife’s menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

Edit: WOW!!!! I cannot believe this got so much attention. I’m glad everyone got a good laugh. A bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn’t know it was me, though. 

My wife has been reading the comments and insisted that I clarify that I know all about her cycle. We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she’s ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it “fitting” because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I’ve seen a tampon- they’re much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn’t even feel it’s presence after it’s im position. 

I’d like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife’s approval."

His mobile used to ping and light up when someone texted him and once I saw that someone had texted him with the name ""Babe ❤️"" I didn't think of it as anything and that I had not seen it correctly but next coming weeks I saw it happening many times. He would get really happy when the person texted, used to smile really big and all. I started thinking I was being cheated on, the last straw for me was when the person texted ""love you too"" I confronted him about and he stared at me for some time before he started laughing.

I cried because what the hell, so he calmed me down and explained to me that Babe is his grandmother, her name is Baberuth and everyone in the family called her Babe, she recently had gotten her first smartphone and he had taught her to text, so when she texted it was exciting for him to see her using emojis and stuff.

Never felt so embarrassed in my life. A few months later he took me to meet her and I kid you not, for a 85 year old Babe is a sport. Seeing her punch a guy square in the jaw for harassing was a sight. We are best friends now.

TL;DR I assumed my boyfriend was cheating on me but it was just his grandmother texting him.

alfq4j,TIFU by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.,61297,0.78,2941,2019-01-30 23:58:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/alfq4j/tifu_by_overestimating_my_clit_and_losing_sight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/alfq4j/tifu_by_overestimating_my_clit_and_losing_sight/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,,False,"Well, fuck. 

Not a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. 

TIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That’s right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

Seriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory “not technically today”) but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I’m off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren’t batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here’s the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I’m jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can’t come on my own if my head isn’t under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I’ve only slept for four hours. I’m losing my mind. 

Anyway, at this point I’m abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I’d put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

I’m sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn’t. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I’m bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? 

Once my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I’ve ever done. 

I continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn’t go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of “what the fuck have i done” red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

Now I’ve got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I’ll probably have to cancel. I’ve been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can’t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I’m shit out of luck. 

TL;DR: I masturbated and now I’m
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

EDIT: Sweet baby jesus’s clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn’t stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I’ve never been more grateful for the colloquialism “booty”). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.

EDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I’m bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess."

We are both on our second marriage, I’m a widower and she’s divorced. 

My late wife was very very adventurous and her first husband was vanilla missionary or nothing. 

Over lunch yesterday we talked about sex and how it’s become mundane with her admitting that she’s only really ever felt comfortable with “ordinary” sex because that’s all she’s known.  I suggested we get a book for her to read to get an idea of what she might like to try. 

So we went into town to the bookshop and bought a book which she spent the next three hours reading in the bath. 

Come bed time, 9pm unusually, I’m dragged to bed and set upon in very pleasurable way until about an hour in I feel fingers caressing my anus and perineum.  Then a finger followed and to my surprise the one and only vibrator (a small one) we have was pushed inside of me.  Much pleasure was had until my wife gasped and started to sound worried. 

Behind me I felt a lot of fumbling, wife was sounding worried then just stopped and said sorry. I  asked what had happened, the vibe had slipped (been pushed) a little to far and had gone all the way in. 

For the next hour we tried to excrete the thing and finally gave up, still buzzing inside. 

As we’d both had a drink a taxi was booked and a trip to A&E was made.  

It took only a few minutes with a speculum, lube and forceps to remove the then quiet vibe from me and after promising to be more careful in future we returned home. 

This morning I skipped my normal bike ride and have sat gingerly at my desk. 

Wife just wandered in and wondered if I’d like to get a bigger vibe so it doesn’t get stuck.  I don’t know what I’ve awakened. 

Tldr: bought wife a sex book and ended up in a&e with vibe stuck in my anus.

c834og,TIFU by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think I was a heroin junkie,60459,0.91,2557,2019-07-02 07:10:14,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c834og/tifu_by_hiding_my_staple_addiction_and_making_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c834og/tifu_by_hiding_my_staple_addiction_and_making_my/,self.tifu,0,11,,text,False,False,False,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I’d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I’ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200B;

This progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady’s second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...

&#x200B;

Fast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I’d spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200B;

So I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn’t enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked “why are you buying all of these boxes of staples”. But I brushed it off as a work issue that I’d get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.

&#x200B;

Over the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn’t know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200B;

This past Thursday after one of my “late nights” I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.

&#x200B;

My wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying “what are you talking about” until my mom said “honey, we saw the pictures”. Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me “do something” with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was

&#x200B;

""I...I like staples.""

&#x200B;

The WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn’t laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a “staple hour” once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people’s perspectives on my problem.

1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.

2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn’t think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn’t think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control."

It is a correlate to childbirth in that just as post-menopausal women wouldn't dare tell an expectant mother how truly agonizing childbirth is, no man in his 50s would traumatize a man in his youthful prime with fears of the anatomical horror that is to come. But times have changed and new technology places men in grave danger, so now you must know of this biological atrocity, in order that you might avoid my disastrous FU....  
Sometime around midlife, men's hair follicles undergo a revolting mutation. While hair atop one's head thins and drops, new hair grows in places you never imagined. Bristle-stiff tufts sprout outside and inside of ears, and up nostrils. Eyebrows become bushy, unruly and coarse. Pubic hair turns gray and scraggly (I shit you not). All these hairs grow alarming fast and require constant attention, lest you become that guy with a bunny paw sticking out of his ear. Their eradication is a battle men wage stoically and silently through the second half of their lives. And, as with any battle, there are casualties. Now, onto my TIFU.

I found a great nose hair trimmer in the As Advertised On TV aisle at CVS. It looks like and operates like a minature hedge trimmer. It's virtually impossible to cut yourself but mows down the hair.

Yesterday I was trimming ear, nose and eyebrow hairs after a shower. I was so happy with the results that I decided to try it on my pubes too. It worked great! Soon I had gone a bit overboard and pretty much shaved my balls and the base of the shaft to the skin. I liked the new look, but my bushy taint was a testicular neck beard that had to go.

I positioned a make up mirror on the bathroom floor and laid down spread eagle, knees up, so I could see and trim everything well. Where once just a few wispy hairs prevailed, unbeknownst to me a virtual forest had arisen! Worst of all, my butthole was sporting Borat mustache assbrows. Trusty new nose hair trimmer in hand, I prepared for battle. 

The assbrows had to go first. I began on the left and quickly decimated the bunghole caterpillar. I moved decisively to the right, prepared to take down assbrow two with one swift stroke close to the skin. However, this was not to be. Instead, my ass hairs wrapped around the trimmer blade like Rappunzel using a superheated curling iron, pulling the device tight against my skin and jamming the blade. The hairs were being ripped from my flesh and the pain was excruciating. No matter how I tried, I couldn't remove the trimmer. Wiggling it  tugged the hairs more; restarting it was a double down that I lost - the hairs were wound even tighter against the blade.

I frog walked naked to my bedroom, one hand holding the trimmer tied between my butt cheeks, and searched for my cuticle scissors. No luck. I did however find a carpet knife. Unbearable pain breeds desperation. Back on the bathroom floor, I tried in vain to cut myself free, nicking the tenderest of flesh twice and drawing the first blood of battle. I was making little progress and it was time to make the ultimate sacrifice. After a suitable prayer, I gripped tight on the trimmer and committed reverse harakiri, Brazilian wax style, ripping off the trimmer blade along with its assbrow net trap. Blinding pain left me curled fetal, hyperventilating, while blood slowly trickled down my ass crack.

I decided to share my TIFU and expose life's cruel secret in the best interest of mankind, that others may avoid falling prey to the technological wonders of As Seen on TV hair removal tools. Young men of Reddit, I beg of you to heed my warning. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

TL;DR used nose hair trimmer on bunghole brows, tore myself a new one.

Edit:. I was pretty sure this TIFU would be popular but I'm genuinely blown away. 57,000 upvotes in a day!?!  54 awards!?!  My post in the same league as the coconut and poop knife!?!?!?!
 So humbling. Thank you.

No, not clickbait, this is word for word what happened. Obligatory didn’t happen today, but I’ve never told anyone this story so I figured I should before I die.

So when I was about 7, my parents took me and my little sister to the park, as parents do. Someone had graffitied the slide with the word “fuck” and being the curious kid I was, asked my dad what it meant.

I hadn’t had the “birds and the bees” talk yet, so my dad figured this was an appropriate time to do so. He goes through the basic idea, man puts peepee in woman and she has a baby grow in her tummy. That’s what the word meant! Too bad he forgot to tell me that it was a swear and NOT the proper term for the act.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, my parents sat me down and revealed that my mom was going to have another baby. I was confused. Don’t two people have to fuck to make a baby? I certainly never saw my parents do such a thing. So I had to ask.

“When did you fuck?”

Obviously my mother lost it and demanded I tell her who taught me that word, whether it was one of the neighborhood kids or someone from school. I told her dad taught me. 

Needless to say, my dad probably didn’t get another fuck for a while after that.

TL;DR: Dad told me what “fuck” meant but forgot to tell me I shouldn’t say it; ended up asking mom why I never saw them make a baby in the most inappropriate way possible"

We've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. 

Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. 

For the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. 

I feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life

TLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

m1jy2b,TIFU by not realizing the cute gym employee thinks I'm a transwoman.,59213,0.92,2037,2021-03-10 05:22:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m1jy2b/tifu_by_not_realizing_the_cute_gym_employee/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m1jy2b/tifu_by_not_realizing_the_cute_gym_employee/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Where to start...ever since the covid lock-down happened I have been letting my hair grow out. At first it was because all the barber shops were closed but then even after I got my hands on a hair clipper it became more amusing to see how far I could take this. Covid had put a stop to my dating life so I wasn't trying to clean up for anyone. So after a year of letting my hair grow out it is now shoulder length.

Another side effect of covid is my weight. I used to go to the gym regularly but stopped once the gyms were closed due to covid. I have never been the type to run on the streets so my weight gained the covid 25 akin to the proverbial freshman 15. I have a pretty skinny frame to begin with so what that means is that all the fat went to my stomach and my now ""man boobs"".

There is just one last piece of information before I can start. I am the type of Asian that has trouble growing facial hair. 

So now we can begin. As most of you know, we are reaching the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of covid. Most states are relaxing their lockdown restrictions and my gym finally reopened last week. Eager to get back into shape, I went on the first day of the reopening. I do my thing on the machines and maybe pushed myself a little too hard or perhaps I am just that out of shape because I was a complete mess by the end of my workout. I make my way toward the men's room but this cute gym employee who was sanitizing the water fountain in between the men's and women's room intercepted me. She said ""you can use that one"" pointing to the women's room and in my exhausted and muscle already starting to ache state, I only thought perhaps there was something wrong with the men's room and that they closed it off. So I go in the women's room (it was empty because the gym just reopened) and I take care of business. When I come out, she said ""I think what you're doing is brave"" and I for some reason thought she meant going to the gym again and said thanks. It wasn't until I got to my car that the light bulb in my head finally turned on - she must think I'm a transwoman. The long hair, man boobs and no facial hair.

Now it wouldn't be so bad if that was the only interaction I have with her but the next day she came over as I was running on the treadmill to introduce herself. And because I have been going to the gym almost everyday (since I'm serious about getting back into shape) she and I have developed a sort of friendship. Just today she asked how long I have been transitioning and I said since covid. I don't know how long I can keep this up for... this is the cheapest gym in my area so I don't want to switch.

TLDR; Gained long hair and moobs during covid. Gym finally reopened and cute employee thinks I'm a transwoman."

But it's a funny story that I couldn't share with reddit at the time.

Rewind back to me at 14 years old. Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

As such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

One night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had ""homework"" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

So I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

Now this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

You see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. 

The desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.

But what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

I also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

I eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

And that's when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

So I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

No one ever brought it up. And I'm thankful. But I know what they saw. And I'm still cringing.

Tl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.

Edit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

EDIT: Holy fuck lmao. I'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this."

So when I was 14 I got into a huge fight with my mother and she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle. It was an incredibly stressful event, and combined with my innate shyness about pooping anywhere but at home, at first I didn't notice that I wasn't pooping. After about two weeks I began to feel awful and tried, without success, to shit. It had built up so much that I think it was impacted. To top it off, my aunt and uncle were weird about bathroom stuff (partly due to having one bathroom in a household of 5 people) and twice while trying to force it they knocked on the door and asked what was taking so long, which made the whole thing worse. 


I didn't tell anyone, partly out of embarrassment and partly out of fear of getting in trouble. (They were strict and I did get in trouble for random things). Another very uncomfortable 2 weeks passed, until one day, a month to the day that I had first arrived and the last time I had pooped, I was sent out to rake some leaves and I was just in total agony. I went back inside and told my aunt what was going on. She was thankfully very understanding (although incredulous that I had waited so long to tell her) and told me she'd had poop issues her whole life. She went out and got me laxatives, suppositories and a fleet enema and showed me how to use it. At this point I was in so much pain and just sweating bullets and dying for relief. 


The remedies barely helped matters, but in an hour or so I hopped on the toilet and tried to make things happen. 


I put both hands on the walls and pushed with all my force, knees up to my chin, straining with all my might. I've since given birth and I pushed harder during this shit than I did pushing out my son. It hurt *so bad* and I felt I was straining every muscle in my body to void this beast. After 10 or so horrifying minutes I still wasn't having any luck, and I began wondering if I should ask to go to the hospital, but the idea of a doctor digging shit out of my asshole way just too much to bear, so I pressed on. After 15-20 agonizing minutes, grunting and straining and thrashing and pleading with my ass to cooperate, finally, finally, I heard my first heavy *plop*. Oh thank God! I cried from the pain and shock and relief. The first foot or so of poop wasn't much easier, it was so hard and dry. I had to twist and strain for awhile, but after that it got a bit easier. About 30 minutes in I stood up and looked into the bowl. Have you ever had a shit so large, so complete that it entirely filled the rim of the toilet, halfway up the bowl rising above the water in thick brown and black coils, iced with a significant amount of blood? I have. I have never and I mean never seen a pile of human shit like that and hope never to again. I would say about 3-4kg of shit. About the size of a large round birthday cake.


I flushed once, twice, plunged, and got back on the toilet for round 2. It just kept coming. This part was significantly easier, despite the fact that my ass had torn a little in the process of round 1. Round 2 was about 3/4 of the size of round 1. Finally, the flood stopped, and I gingerly wiped, flushed, cleaned the toilet and emerged from the bathroom a changed person. I ached inside for a few days after but oh my god the relief was incredible. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. 


TL;DR; didn't shit for a month, had the most painful shit apocalypse ever and lived to tell the tale."

This isn't really an issue because we get along great and I raised him alone. I also have a big enough house that he he has more of his own space. I'm 43, he's 24.

My basement is a makeshift boxing gym. I have some free weights, punching bags, and boxing gloves, among other things. So when my son moved back in we both decided this could be a fun way to stay in shape and bond. We practice a few times a week.

Yesterday, we were sparring (no holds barred but we were wearing boxing headgear) and I guess I didn't wrap my glove tightly enough, because it fell off and I didn't notice and neither did my son. 

So I go to punch, he gives me this deer-in-the-headlights look, like OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and then I punched him, bare knuckled, in the face, without holding back.

He has a broken nose. I have two broken fingers.

TL;DR: Absolutely lit my son's shit up with a full-strength punch and now we're both out of commission for a few weeks. Also, I bought new boxing gloves. And duct tape. I still feel bad but he isn't upset, and we've been laughing telling other people the story."

I'll try to keep it short.

I met a girl through a mutual friend. We've known eachother for roughly a year, but haven't spend time alone yet, always in a group. She's very sweet and pretty.

She's not completly deaf , she can still hear a bit, with the help of hearing aids.

I guess  mild deafness, not sure tho?.

Yesterday we met up with our mutual friends, we were having a barbecue. Later on, we ran out of snacks, so the other two went to the grocery store

&#x200B;

We were alone in the yard, chatting etc.

Now I noticed that she kept staring at my lips, so I thought to myself does she want to kiss me?.

Since she didn't stop staring I thought, that it's obvious. This time I'm not going to miss a hint.

I leaned in to give her a kiss, I mean she did kinda kiss me back, but afterwards it was like dead silence.  Thank God the other two arrived a few minutes later.

The rest of the evening was super akward between us. Later as she left, I told the other two friends that I had kissed her because she kept staring at my lips.

They started laughing saying Of course she's staring at your lips , she's lipreading.!

Man, I totally forgot that deaf people also use lipreading to communicate, and since she's never actually done that before I didn't take that into consideration

This will definitly be one of the moments that'll make me stay up at night and cringe, plus I probably ruined the friendship.

TL;DR by thinking my friend wanted to kiss me, she probably didn't.


UPDATE:  Okay, Guys I sent her a message, asking if she wants to come over.

She said she'll be here in an hour.

I'm nervous lol, I'm trying to convince my roomate to go on a long walk.


Update 2:

Sorry that you guys had to wait that long. 
She just left 5 minutes ago.

I didn't tell her beforehand, that I wanted to talk to her about the kiss, so it was a bit akward approaching the topic.
 I can't go into full detail now, but I told her that I didn't mean to make her feel uncomftable and that I had misread the signs. 
We had a good laugh. 
Afterwards I asked her If she'd be down to maybe try things out if she's interested.

The thing is, she's going to move to Munich, Germany in a few months (end of march) (I live in France) and she told me that, while she does like me, she didn't plan on making any romantic interest, because she doesn't want to get too attached, due to her moving away anyways. 

 She admitted to liking me alot and would like to give it a shot despite the circumstances ,  but only under the condition that I am being serious about it, since she doesn't want something that's only casual.

We're going on a date on Tuesday, and we'll just see if it works out between us."

Love him to death, he's an amazingly playful dog (Jack Russell).

A few years ago, he started developing really itchy red skin on his toes, and the poor pup would constantly lick his toes to the point where he was making them almost hairless. Took him to the vet, they said it was allergies, and prescribed him medication ($60 a month!). We've been buying this medication for him ever since, occasionally skipping a few weeks and using a mini-dose of Benadryl until we purchased more allergy pills. The pills helped, as in he wasn't constantly licking his toes all the time, but he would still lick them so it wasn't a surefire solution. Let's say 80% cure.

Now, on to the fuckup. We tried giving him the pills with nothing, and he just puts them in his mouth and spits them out. So, we started putting them in a little bit of peanut butter, which he licks off a spoon (and the pill gets swallowed along with the PB).

A few weeks ago we ran out of peanut butter, so we used jello instead. It worked just as well because he swallowed it right up. Over the next few days we did the same thing, and he wasn't licking his toes AT ALL. Lightbulb...we took our dog to the vet to get an allergy test (which we should have done FROM THE START).

**Test Result:** Dog is allergic to peanut butter. We've been giving him his allergy pills dipped in the substance he's allergic to.

He's a happy dog now with no more itchy toes!

Also in the store waiting for orders was a girl who looked around my age and a guy who seemed to be a bit older (35-45). I noticed the guy was talking the girl’s ear off and she didn’t seem very interested in the conversation. Next thing I notice, she’s approaching me saying “Brian?” 

My name isn’t Brian, but before I could correct her I remembered reading something online that said “if a girl ever pretends to know you, play along, she might be in trouble”. So I played along and started having a friendly chat with her as if I knew her. Well, not long into the conversation she looks at me and goes “wait, you’re not Brian”. To which I respond, “I know, I thought we were doing a thing”. Then a bit louder and annoyed she says “why would you pretend to be someone I know?!” Now the guy she was with before comes over and asks if everything is alright.

Knowing I had fucked up, I just told them honestly what I was doing. Turns out he was her boyfriend and he was talking about fantasy baseball, that’s why she was so disinterested. She found it funny and thanked me even though I read the situation wrong. He was kinda offended but understood. I have never been more embarrassed.

TLDR Some girl mistook me for her friend, so I pretended to be him because I thought she was trying to use me to get out of a conversation with a creepy guy who turned out to be her boyfriend and she just actually thought I was a different person.

EDIT: hey, thanks for the awards! And I’ll proudly rock my new title as Brian due to this encounter."

Let me explain. My cat generally doesn't like being picked up. However, one time, six years ago, a moth flew into my house. My cat wanted to kill it, but he couldn't reach it. I don't know how I got the idea, but I picked him up to help him reach it. At first, he squirmed, then when he realized he could reach the moth, he forgot about me and proceeded to murder the moth.  Afterwards, I'd put him down, give him a treat and a couple pets. And from then on, we had pact. When a moth, spider, or some other bug was out of reach, I'd pick him up and my cat would kill it. Truly a win-win situation.

Fast forward six years to today. A moth flew into my bedroom. Just as I get up to kill it, I see my cat staring intensely at it. He's got this determined, adorable, murderous look on his face. As I'm looking at him, he turns to me and I can almost see the pleading in his eyes, ""Please, I got this."" 

""Okay,"" I respond. I pick him up and he starts waving his paws in what are several failed attempts at catching the moth (wtf boy? Maybe a little rusty at this). Then, in what can only be described a 400 IQ move, the moth flies directly at my cat. My cat panics and flails everywhere. I scream and drop him from about 7 ft up (he's fine). Pain.  There is only pain.  I look at my [arm](https://i.imgur.com/3fDLYDo.jpg).  In the moment, I have no idea how bad it is, so I just rush to the bathroom to disinfect my arm. Fortunately, it's not that bad. It just stings whenever I move left arm or hand.

I walk back to my room and see the fucker just [laying there](https://i.imgur.com/jM1Ht43.jpg). ""You see [this](https://i.imgur.com/44Eyq8v.jpg) shit?"" I asked him. He sniffed it a bit and just kind of looked unconcerned. ""Meh, just a minor flesh wound. Didn't even rupture an artery. My claws must be dull. I mean, that looks bad."" 

I go back into my room and see the moth there. I go to kill it and my cat makes this weird trilling sound. He's staring intensely at the moth eyes filled with murder lust. He looks at me for permission.  This time, I killed the moth. 

tl;dr: cat broke our murder pact. probably should never have formed one with a cat anyway."

UPDATE 2: Third interview is in a weeks time! This is dragging on, sorry :)
UPDATE: OH MY WORD! I've been invited to the second round of interviews! 

Obligatory; this happened yesterday. The memory still makes me cringe. And cry. I had a job interview with a CEO, in person, despite COVID. I was super nervous, as per usual. Maybe even more than usual, because I really wanted this job. I tried to calm myself down but by the time the interviewer showed up I could literally feel my heartbeat in my throat. He (50ish/M) walked down the stairs towards me, in his nice suit, but stopped halfway down. I figured the interview would take place upstairs, so I got up to meet him. And as I was walking up the stairs towards him, he put his arm up.. and his elbow out. And my brain just sort of went ‘ERRORRR!’.

I suppose it could have only meant two things. It could have meant (A) ‘Please take my arm, milady, so I can escort you to the room as if we’re strolling down the promenade together’, or (B) ‘Please give me an *elbow bump*, since we can’t shake hands’, which is *really* not an uncommon gesture at all in the Netherlands.
So what did I do? Yes, I went with option A and I eagerly locked arms with this strange man that I’d never met before in my life, as if saying ‘yes, good sir, let’s go for that stroll’.

And then we just stood there! Arm in arm, halfway up the stairs, sheepishly staring at each other. I wanted the earth to swallow me whole. I just didn’t know what to do next and I don’t think he’d fully understood what’d happened, so neither of us moved.

When he’d finally gathered his senses, he said ‘I eh.. meant to give you an elbow-bump?’, after which I quickly put as much distance between us as I could and mumbled ‘Right! Right, yes, that makes much more sense’. Because it did, let's face it.

And then we had the interview.

TL;DR I got so nervous that I misjudged the CEO's arm gesture during a job interview, and locked arms with him as if we were Best Friends 4Ever.

Why am I like this?

EDIT (1): Typo's

Now, my brother and I are of age and old enough to understand the santa process. However, we have a younger sister who still fully believes. She did the list, put out the cookies, yadayada.

The main thing she wanted this Christmas (and last year) was a Nintendo switch. I don’t know much about it other than it’s expensive and could make a child’s Christmas wish come true. 

So it comes midnight and My mother and I are wrapping up the presents for everyone and checking off the list to make sure nothing was forgotten. (Everyone else is asleep). But then we come across the Nintendo. 

My mom asks me where it is, I have no fucking clue. I go up and ask my dad, he has no fucking clue. Everyone in my family, no.fucking.clue.

We all begin scrounging the house, top to fucking bottom. Every corner, every drawer, every hiding spot. Even the fucking vents????? 

Time passes, we’re still looking, it’s 2 in the morning. We should’ve been asleep an hour ago.  My mother has to wake up in 4 hours to get ready for a full day of work and be with us for presents. She’s crying, my dads pissed, I’m nervous. 

I send my parents up to bed and tell them to leave it up to me. (Still don’t know why the fuck I said this). So I stay up, still looking. It’s now 4am. I’m ready to pass out. 

I decide to write the letter from santa myself. Stating the following. “Dear ______, ...... I hit a major storm in the middle of the night and lost Dasher and 60% of my presents!! Expect a delivery from the elves within the next few days!” 

So I’m looking up what stores I can buy this fucking Nintendo switch again, of course they’re all closed at 4am but they’re closed all day for Christmas too. Now I’m fucking buggin

I decide to let the note do it’s magic, and pray I can find a Nintendo switch to buy AGAIN. 

Christmas morning comes along, she reads the note, she’s freaking out that santa even made it in such a bad storm. But she’s also freaking out that Dasher is on the loose. I try to calm her down and she keeps screaming that santa can’t fly without all his reindeer and is probably “missing”. (If you’ve ever seen Christmas chronicles, she hit it spot on) 

Finally we open the fucking rest of the presents. 
WE LEFT THE FUCKING SWITCH GAME WRAPPED AND SHE OPENED IT. Gave it the fuck away instantly. Now I’m frustrated as fuck that we were so unprepared. This is supposed to be “huge”.

We finish up presents, my mom goes to work, my sister is playing with her stuff and I’m checking out my new bling. 

I then remember that my polish for jewelry was in the trunk of the car. (I don’t know why, don’t ask) 

I open up the fucking trunk, and there it is. THE NINTENDO FUCKING SWITCH. SITTING RIGHT THERE. STARING AT ME. I start crying tears of joy. I don’t have to spend another 300 on a fucking console and games. 

I wrap it instantly and leave it on the front bench. 
I go upstairs, play a hoofing sounds of a horse from my speaker, and make a loud bang. 

“WHAT WAS THAT” -my sister 

“I don’t know, it sounded like it came from outside. Want me to check?” -me 

“SIS. ITS DASHER. IT HAS TO BE. HE HAS IT.” 

She runs as fast as I’ve ever seen her run down the stairs and whips the door open. Before even seeing the present on the bench, she goes to look at the roof to see if dasher is there. Lol. Finally, she falls upon the gift wrapped up on the bench.  

She grabs it, runs inside, opens it, cries.

“Santa really does listen.” -my sister 

And then I cried. Again. Because I was so relieved it was over. 

All in all, She was happy, I was happy, my parents pissed they left it somewhere so stupid, and Christmas was even more fun for my sister.

I am never fucking touching a Nintendo switch ever again. 

Edit: I understand people are commenting that they believe this is a made up story. I wish it was. I did not plan nor enjoy going through the stress at first but at the end it was all worth it. I’m the oldest sister of this family and believe it’s important to keep her belief going. It brings our family joy to see her so excited for Santa. 

This is literally my first time posting on Reddit, and I had no clue it would blow up like this. I read them with my boyfriend all the time (specifically this community) and decided this story was worth a share. Thanks to everyone who has sent Christmas wishes. God bless you all and Merry Christmas. 

TL:DR we lost my sisters most wanted Xmas present, lost our fucking minds looking for it, and it ended up being in the fucking car trunk."

My parents are 75-year old Republicans. That was a big maybe.

&#x200B;

Well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. You put half a candy bar down and YOINK, gone when you come back.

&#x200B;

You can guess what happened. My mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. Her last words, high as a kite, were ""I think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200B;

They took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. At which point I assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the RedBull Orbit Jumper.

&#x200B;

Anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. So now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

Obligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I'm in Canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but I'm planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)

Second update from my dad: Mom's surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.

FP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I'm headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

UPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

Check out my adorable mom

I was reading this TIFU post about a mother who told her 4 year old that her hero Bob Ross is dead. One part got me in a fit and naturally my girlfriend asked me what made me laugh, so i started explaining the story in short.

As soon as I told her the kid had to cry because she had just been told Bob was dead, all colour left her face. With tears in her eyes and a pouting lip she asked me if I was serious - I explained to her that Bob Ross had in fact died in 1995, showing her the Wikipedia page to corroborate it.

My girlfriend is up there on the cries-because-swans-can-be-gay spectrum, so surprising here with this fact was not a smart move. The weeping waned away, but the sad and defeated mood stayed and now I'm on my way to pick up a bottle of wine and a tub of ice cream,so we can enjoy that during a Bob Ross paint-along.

I guess it'll be a watercolour made with tears. Thanks, /u/garryoak

TL;DR Girlfriend didn't know Ross was dead. Now she does."

As we were waking up this morning she asked me if I was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. I responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but I was looking forward to it nonetheless.

She looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. I thought she was just trying to make sense of what I had said. Instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that I ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. I didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

It took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. Unfortunately for her I've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

TL ; DR

Made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. Oops.

EDIT: I'm honestly surprised that I have to say this, but this was all in good fun. My wife is fucking awesome and probably one of the chillest, low-maintenance people I've ever known.  We have been laughing about this all day. The number of reddit relationship therapists showing up to tell me about my unhealthy relationship is staggering."

My son coming out to me was not a shock in the grand scheme of things.

I went up to my son’s room to ask what he wanted for dinner. I knocked and went in. I was tired after work and things weren’t really registering. He just said “Mom, I’m gay.”

For some reason it just didn’t register that he had just told me something so major for him. I don’t know what part of my brain thought this was a good idea, but I just said, “ok, do you want pizza for dinner?” 

It took a few minutes for me to realize what I said and that I did not react properly. I went back to him and apologized and gave him the whole “I love you just the same” spiel and we laughed about my reaction, but I’m still SO embarrassed and mad at myself. Definitely wasn’t the way I had always planned to respond!

l80g8l,TIFU by mistakenly believing exercise turns you on for nearly thirty years.,57940,0.86,2631,2021-01-30 00:13:30,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l80g8l/tifu_by_mistakenly_believing_exercise_turns_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l80g8l/tifu_by_mistakenly_believing_exercise_turns_you/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"So this is going to need some context so I look like less of an idiot (though I thoroughly assure you I'm an idiot).

Ten minutes ago I found out. Ten goddamn minutes ago, I found out that a worldview I've held my entire life is, in fact, not true, and apparently I'm just a weirdo.

You see, whenever I exercise, something goes haywire in my brain that spikes my libido to something ridiculous. Think Jekyll and Hyde. That's weird for me to type, because my entire life I thought that was *everyone.* I legitimately thought that was just a common thing: people exercise, and as a result get turned on.

And you know what, in my defense how could I not. What are workout ads if not ""grr sweat lookat this sweaty sexy body grr,"" and like 30% of all porn involving women in their 30's (which is like 90% of my porn) can be summed up with ""hey you know what goes great with pilates? penis."" I thought you people were like me, who legitimately got turned on through exercise, because why else would you advertise it like that and have so many euphemisms? Dafuq is wrong with you? But apparently I was just dropped on my head too many times as a child or something.

Fuck. Now this is a FUCK UP because as I'm typing this in real time, I'm remembering all the times in my life I've tried to incorporate cardio into foreplay. No, you idiot, not like ""hur dur lets do planks in bed before we blast our triceps,"" but christ, ugh this hurts so damn much to type now that I know it's *all a lie* but shit like getting bootycalls and responding with shit like ""mhm lemme do a quick workout first"" OH GOD I'm realizing how fucking stupid that is if there's no context WHY DIDNT ANY OF YOU TELL ME THIS. I THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD AND WAS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH BUT INSTEAD I WAS THE FUCKING FOOL WHO WAS DOING SQUATS IN THE GYM BEFORE SEX. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I DID THAT SHIT THINKING THEY WORKED THE SAME WAY AND EXERCISE ALSO GOT THE BLOOD FLOWING AND WAS THE MOTHER OF APHRODISIACS AND

Oh god. Oh god oh FUCK. ink;efwerioj'ewij'oderwo'ijerfij'eruhotrijepr I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK OUT BEFORE TOO. Oh my good Jesus Christ I

I can't believe I did that. Oh my god save me I didn't know. I LITERALLY TOLD GIRLS I WAS WITH, thinking in my STUPID BRAIN, my STUPID STUPID BRAIN, that it would be hot if they worked out beforehand. *I told them they should work out more.*

What the fuck was I doing I'm literally melting in horror here right now. I'm remembering it all; I literally thought it would do the same thing to them as it did to me, make the sex better, make everything better, but instead, INFUCKINGSTEAD I'm the goddamn JACKASS who probably came across as 'HUR DUR TONE UR ABS BEFORE HAVING SEX WITH ME' or some nightmarish nonsense. Like some hellish dudebro straight from the bowels of the foulest yacht club fraternity. FUCK. How the FUCK did they put up with that. How the FUCK do I apologize for that, because what the fuck am I going to do just call them up and be like ""hehe hey yeah Angie I know it's been five years since we've talked and I know you're in a lovely relationship but I wanted to tell you those times I tried to get us to go on a jog before sex wasn't because I thought you were fat but because apparently something's wrong with my brain.""

No. No, I can't do that, I have to live with that. For the rest of my life, my goddamn life I have to live with that. Why didn't you tell me. Why didn't any of you tell me. All the 'workout euphemisms' I've used with girlfriends. Oh god their blank stares make sense now. Fifteen years of dating, fifteen years of blank stares. It all makes sense now. It all makes sense.

Oh god. oh fuck.

TL;DR

Christ. Something is odd with my brain in that exercise of any form spikes my libido, and from workout ads, euphemisms, etc, I believed everyone on earth worked the same way. So I've incorporated that into my relationships and flings, like a goddamn idiot, my entire life, much to their confusion. No one corrected me. Found out just now that no, it doesn't work like that.

*Edit: I’ll respond to these comments later, I’ve got some... apologies to make first. Not sure how I’m going to go about “I’m sorry that I made us jog before sex” sound sincere, but I’ll think of something.*  


*Update: Apologized to an ex I'm still close with about this, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. Apparently she just thought I was 'super into my body,' like an egomaniac. Which is...... better? I dunno, glad I closed that up but don't think I'll message the exes I'm not on good terms with; that would be too dumb to just casually bring up after five years of not talking.* "

This was my first-ever boyfriend and he turned out to be a piece of crap, so I was obviously a bit hesitant. But some old friends from high school were visiting my town and asked if I wanted to go on a bar crawl with them and I figured fuck it, it's not like anything will happen (other than getting drunk with some pals), so why not? 

At the first bar we run into a group of guys from my University. I had seen some of them around but never spoke to them before. One of my friends decides she's going to force me to ""get out of my shell"" and drags our group over to talk with them. I'm EXTREMELY quiet (like... weirdly quiet to most people) so I end up sitting in the corner of our booth and not saying anything, just drinking and feeling awkward. Well, one of the guys in the other group (let's call him Adam) is also being weirdly quiet. So my friends and his friends, who are already tipsy, decide to make things as awkward as possible by making us play truth or dare--except we have to drink when we don't want to answer something. 

There are a lot of personal/sexual questions neither of us want to answer, so we end up drinking quite a bit. And by the time we're done the first bar, Adam and I are on a whole different plane of existence from everyone else. And it turned out we had a lot in common, and he was pretty cute, and we're goofing around and laughing the whole time. I started to get butterflies in my stomach, and not just from the alcohol. Adam has my exact sense of humour and is really sweet and kind. We wander off and start having deep drunk conversations about feeling left out of things and how annoying it is when people say shit like ""Can they speak?"" I tell him I'm walking home and he offers to walk with me. I know where this is going but I'm drunk enough that I don't feel nervous, plus I feel like I have a genuine connection with this guy. Our friends are wolf-whistling as we leave and instead of being embarassed, I feel weirdly proud. 

So we get to my place, talk and smoke for a bit, and do the deed. I wake up earlier than him and decide I'm going to make a nice breakfast. I want to impress him and show him I like him, and everyone likes a good breakfast when they have a hangover, right? So I sneak out of bed and make scrambled eggs, french toast, and sausage. I prefer almond milk so I use that for the eggs and french toast. He wakes up and tells me I look just as cute sober. At this point I'm convinced he's the love of my life. He sees the breakfast and gets excited and I'm like yes! My plan worked! I'm going to get to his heart through his stomach! 

We eat and everything's going great for a few bites. Then he makes a weird face and clears his throat. His eyes start to widen and he asks me what if there were nuts in the bread or something. I say no, but I used almond milk. He jumps out of his chair and says ""CALL AN AMBULANCE RIGHT. NOW."" I'm freaking the fuck out. He's wheezing and stuff and looks absolutely panicked. I ask if he has an epipen and he shakes his head no. So I call an ambulance and tell them he's having an allergic reaction and paramedics come and haul him off. 

This happened last weekend. I have not heard back from him since. I found his buddy and confirmed he is not dead. I guess accidentally triggering a severe allergic reaction does not lead to romance. 

TL;DR: Tried to impress my romantic interest by cooking for him. He went into anaphylaxis and no longer wants to speak to me."
c4i94n,TIFU by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend,57269,0.92,8206,2019-06-24 10:03:07,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"I have grapheme-color synesthesia. Basically I see letters and numbers in colors. The letter 'E' being green for example. A couple months ago I was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. He asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. Since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what I said a few months ago. Always being the sameish as course. He still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe I just memeroized them really really well.

Tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head. I asked him what colour are the letters in his head. He looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

My boyfriend didnt understand what I meant by visualizing the letters. He didn't believe me that I can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

Turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. When he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. He can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. He thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... Its crazy to him the fact that I can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

Now I have a boyfriend that is really upset. He feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. He's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing I wasnt pulling his chain. Hes pretty upset and I feel really bad. 

Tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (Cant visualize anything at all)

Edit; Oh wow this blew up. I just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. He never thought I was lying. I think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia."

Sometimes she would come over to place and stay for a day or two. 
So, around 2 weeks ago she said she wasnt feeling okay and she needed some time alone. I said sure and did not really say anything. Yesterday she messaged me we talked for a bit and she said she was now feeling better. I asked her why she wasnt feeling okay she said it was because she broke up with her boyfriend. Turns out SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND even she started dating me. When I asked why she never told me she said it was because I never asked and she was actually considering me more like a friend.

My first house today was beautiful and pretty big (4,000+ sq ft.) I had never cleaned this house before today. 

It's kind of interesting to clean the home of people you have never actually met while they are not home. I never snoop but I do learn about people just by the state of their house or whatever is out. These people seemed like they really needed us. I would guess they are busy and don't have much time for cleaning and organizing (but definitely have an active sex life judging by the master bedroom).

I love cleaning dirty houses and was like amping myself up doing a mini Rocky training montage warmup and finding the perfect music to work to (Pantera). I was sweating like 4 hours in but I was getting this house spar👏ka👏ling! All I had left to clean were the floors when a man walked in. 

I welcomed him home and let him know I just needed to clean the floors and would be finished soon. He looked super confused and then kind of grinned and asked if I was his birthday gift.  I didn't really know what he meant. Maybe his wife scheduled the service on his birthday? I just answered with, ""maybe? Happy birthday, Mr. Henricks!"" To which he looked even more confused and told me his name was not Henricks. 

Well. That's because his next door neighbor, my actual client, is Mr. Henricks. I walked my happy ass into the wrong fucking house and cleaned the hell out of it. And then the guy who lived there came home and thought I was a sex worker role playing as a housecleaner hired by his wife as a birthday present. 

I was so totally embarrassed explaining myself to this guy and my boss.  (The entry instructions in the app said the client wouldn't be home but that there was a key under the mat. There was no key under the mat but the front door was unlocked 🤦‍♀️). This is not even the first time in my life that I have let myself into the wrong house, although the first time was not a work thing.

On the plus side, dude was so happy with how clean his house was that I finished the floors and he paid me what my company would have charged him plus a tip!

TL;DR; I disappointed a man who wanted to get laid by a maid."

If not, look them up on YouTube, there's nothing like them.

Ah yes, the sweet memories of my first time on one of these. I feel that my mental/emotional scars have healed enough to tell this gem.

At the time my girlfriend, now Fiancée, worked as a photographer for one of those resorts with the indoor and outdoor water parks. One of her perks was that her and a family member/friend could get into the waterpark for free, so one hot summer day she had off and we both decided it'd be fun to go there and cool down for the day.

While we were there, I discovered one of there most ""Thrilling"" looking waterslides. Basically you stand in this tube, and then the slide operator presses a button and this slide drops you straight down a good **90 FEET**, before you actually start going down the water slide. Me, being a thrill seeker, of course had to try it. So I made the great climb up to the top of the slide, stood in line, and finally it was my turn. Once I got in the tube, the operator told me to keep my legs crossed. Now I'm a pretty big heavy guy, so I was like ""That's uncomfortable as fuck, I'm not doing that"". So there I was standing in the tube, having a panic attack from anticipation, with my legs not crossed. The operator finally presses the button, the bottom opens and I fall straight down the water slide. Very quickly I realized why they have you cross your legs. Water shot so far up my ass, so fast, I swear I tasted it in my mouth. My body raced down that slide, as I questioned every life choice that I have ever made.

Once I made it to the bottom, I sat there for a moment, absolutely violated. I felt like someone in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. I built up the courage to finally stand up, and all I could feel was the nice warm stream of water mixed with shit, and maybe a little bit of blood shoot out of my ass faster than the Steamboat Geyser at Yellowstone National Park. I quickly got off the slide and ran to the bathroom, with a trail of shitty water tailing me as the slide operator stared in awe. They had to shut down the slide for the rest of the day :'), but man was my asshole clean after that!

Moral of the story: Keep your damn legs crossed on waterslides.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Went on a waterslide that drops you straight down 90 feet. My ass was violated by the force of the water. As I got off the slide water, shit, and blood proceeded to shoot out of my ass and they had to shut it down for the day.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for blowing up my post, like I blew up the water slide guys :)

Edit 2: For those of you who are wondering, this occurred at Camelback Resorts on Paradise Plunge (Such an ironic name....) which can be found [here.](https://www.camelbackresort.com/waterparks/poconos-pa-indoor-water-park/slides/) It is in fact a 60 foot drop, but my ass says 90.

Finally: Yes I saw the other waterslide post and the comments on a different sub reddit. That post is what inspired me to share my own experience here which is actually quite a common one."

She finds it hilarious and I’ve grown to tolerate it cause of love and all. 

I decided my time for revenge had come. 

Cut to dinner time, about to boil a box of rigatoni pasta when the inspiration hits me from a video on social media I saw. I hide a piece of that rigatoni between my teeth and make my way into the living room where my wife was relaxing on the couch after a long day of being a nurse. 

“Hey sweetheart, do you mind rubbing my neck? I feel like I have a kink in it or something” I ask her. At this point I can barley contain my excitement for this amazing prank as she happily begins massaging my neck for me. 

After 30-45 seconds, I then bite down hard on that piece of uncooked rigatoni which released a sickening yet satisfying crunch sound. I give a little “ow” sound and immediately go limp, falling face first into the couch. 

Now my wife is mostly a calm, non-emotional type person, but her visceral reaction of terror and worry and panic that came flooding out of her while she started to shake my limp body and began to check my vitals made me feel guilt I’ve never felt before. After only a short time I give up on the ruse and show her it was just pasta. 

To say she was livid is an understatement. Been sleeping on the couch ever since. Worth it. 

tl;dr: I revenge pranked my wife by making her think she killed me.

EDIT: Wow, thanks everyone. Lots of the same questions/comments being asked so I can’t answer them all; HOWEVER: My wife and I have an extremely healthy, understanding, and communicative marriage and it’s been so for many years. Just wanted to put that to rest.

It’s filled with the kinds of random things that seem like a good idea to keep but have no use whatsoever in my day-to-day life… Like that track medal I won in high school, or a guitar string replacement tool, or that “naughty coupon booklet” my wife bought me when we were still dating. You know, stuff like that. 

I was looking for something in there the other day and I came across the booklet. It was untouched, all coupons in tact. When she gave it to me, I thought it was a cute gesture but we were already doing all those things anyway so I tucked it away and forgot about it. Fast forward 15 years (many of those married with children) the novelty that was lost on me in the past suddenly came into sharp focus. Mental bookmark: This can come in handy, especially these days when “the spice” needs all the help it can get. 

One day she comes home from work. I was upstairs and I could just feel the negative energy rush into our house. The sound of her bad day could be heard in her footsteps. Her heels were aggressively clacking against the floor. I could tell from the combo sigh-growl coming from downstairs that I was about to get the business for something I didn’t even know I did. 

I head downstairs and we say hi and ask about each other’s day. Her’s sucked, mine was great which automatically made things worse. As predicted, she starts to unload big time. It’s brutal and I’m just listening quietly, certain there’s nothing I can say or do to make it better. She notices I’m not engaging and asks what my deal is. I pull out the coupon booklet that I had slipped into my pocket during a hasty moment of questionable “quick thinking” and flip it to the blowjob coupon. I ceremoniously fold it along the perforations and tear it out, handing it to her purposefully. 

Her, confused and caught a little off guard: “What’s this?”

Me, pointing to the coupon: “See, ‘Good for one blowjob any time.’”

Her, livid: “Are you fucking kidding me?”

Me, still purposeful: “No, it says ‘any time.’” 

Her, shocked, face turning crimson: “…”

Me, doubling down and drawing her attention to the fine print which says: “Drop your pants, I’ll get on my knees and suck your dick with a lick and a squeeze.”

She goes nuclear. NU-CLEEEEE-ERR. She snatches the booklet and tears it into smithereens. I’ve never seen her so mad in my life. Achievement unlocked. 

There is a 100% chance this MAY or MAY NOT end in divorce.

Tldr: Basically the title.

I feel so nervous right now.

Sorry for the weird format, I’m writing this in mobile.

So I (17 f) am bisexual as said in the title. My family is very religious and most of them are homophobic. Today, we had to go to church. Now, for some background information here, I’m considered “the perfect Christian girl” and it fucking sucks. I have to pretend to be someone I’m not just to satisfy many of these   people. Today I was in a really bad mood, and when my family and I  went to church, they started talking about LGBTQ people.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

I don’t know what came over me, but I started to defend them. Definitely didn’t look suspicious. When I was in the middle of an argument with an adult, this kid says “you sound so gay right now defending those abominations”. 

I snapped and said “ I’m bisexual you ignorant idiot”.

Best way to come out.

Anyway, the realization didn’t hit me until five seconds after. Currently I’m in a bathroom typing this.

TL;DR I went to church, defended LGBTQ people and came out of the closet in the worst way possible.

Edit: First of all, thank you guys for the support. As for the people at church, we had a little talk. They said that this news are not very pleasant in the slightest, but I convinced them to think about giving LGBTQ people a chance. Some apologized to me, but others looked at me differently. My mother said she actually supports me :D! Again, thank you guys for the support, but I think I have to take a break from everything.

Thanks,

A bisexual mess.

Edit 2: After some thinking, I came to the conclusion that I have to say that you guys are awesome too. Some of you guys are probably going through some tough times too, and I just wanted to say that many people will support you no matter what. It also astonished me that you guys came over and supported a stranger that you will probably never meet and for that, you guys are strong and brave. Thank you."

Had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. After changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, I went to visit a dermatologist. Anyways, turns out I have a skin condition called Pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. So she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. Anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. After showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and I sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. I noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( Rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back REAALLLYYY good. So naturally I took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. Naturaly I decided to take it to the next logical level: Flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (Yes I know this sounds mildy retarded). What ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. I busted a nut so hard I started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and I fucking fainted. My parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a REAAAL worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. So yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. FML

TL;DR: Found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided I wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. Came so hard I went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

I'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

EDIT: WOW I had no Idea this would blow up like this! Thanks for the golds, silvers and platinum kind strangers!

Ps: Am looking into becoming hair dryer sales guy now"

We have grown used to herding the two younger ones to the downstairs bathroom while they wonder why their brother is taking so long in the shower.

We did not anticipate that the minute everyone else was out of the house, the living room would become fair game. Having driven halfway down the block without my phone, I decided to just walk back to my house because parking in my weird driveway takes more time than the walk. I unlocked and opened the front door in the span of a couple of seconds. This was my mistake. How could I be so careless as to expect to be able to just open my own front door? What was I thinking? I should have knocked. I should have pointedly jangled my keys for 30 seconds before unlocking the door. I should have worn a cowbell.

Anything to prevent me from seeing my darling offspring, my beautiful baby boy, my only son, pants down, humping the couch through a strategically placed towel. WHY?

Tldr: found out in the worst possible way that my teenage son is having an affair with my couch. At least he used protection.

Edit: WOAH! Did not expect that many responses! I promise we had a gentle conversation about how it's normal and natural but please not in public areas of the house even if we're out.

[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g3hmo4/tifu_wormageddon_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

This fuck up has been set up perfectly for disaster over the past few months and is continuing to destroy my life. This is a long one, but every detail counts in portraying one of the worst weeks of my life. 

Let me preface this by saying I love my cat more than anything, and while he is currently not sleeping anywhere near me, he's still getting a lot of cautious love. I can't imagine being self-isolated alone without him right now. Truly, I love him too much - too much love got us here today.

In January, I adopted an 11 yo, 19 lbs chonker. I fell in love instantly. His last family returned him after 6 months with a bad case of fleas. He had been defleaed but came home with a slew of other health issues. By end of January after a lot of vet visits, he seemed to be on the mend. I knew what I was signing up for when I adopted a senior cat, but just didn't realize the endless possibilities. Truly, I tell him every night before bed he's my ride or die, and that's about to be tested with this saga of the greatest love story ever told.

Early February, he starts coughing and stops pooping in his litterbox, despite me cleaning it daily. He's still peeing in there, but seems cautious and runs out immediately. Even when he started pooping on the floor (thank God for wood floors), he'd run under my bed from it. That was the only time he'd go under my bed, otherwise he was cuddled up on or next to me. His medical chart from when I adopted him said he had issues with litterbox pooping- they suspected he was afraid of his last family's other cat and it was behavioral, but something didn't add up. He was fine with pooping in the litterbox for the first month after his kitty enema. I cleaned up his poop every other day and saw nothing out of the ordinary. He was starting to lose weight, which was good because as cute of a chonker as he is, it's NOT healthy, folks. I stopped free feeding him, started feeding him scheduled wet food meals, and we had daily playtime to get him to a healthy weight.

I bring him into the vet in February for the 6th time in a month and a half. He had half of his teeth removed before I adopted him. This resulted in an incision infection and an enema due to opiod constipation. This visit was for his cough. I even ask if he could have worms. The vet tells me, ""I know you're trying to be a good pet owner, but he likely has allergies and it's a behavioral issue. This might be something he has to live with. Come see me if his mucus turns brown"". I had been right about every single Dr. Google diagnosis up until this point, but whatever. I buy an air purifier, vacuum and clean regularly, change the bedding weekly- I already have an obsessive cleaning schedule, and COVID/quarantine has only allowed that the time to thrive. Ask any of my previous roommates and I am the cleanest person you'll ever live with. Despite the cleaning, some coughing days were better than others.

All of a sudden end of last week, he starts coughing a lot less, and I start feeling like absolute shit. My best friend even makes a joke that I caught whatever my cat had. Sick, sick foreshadowing. 

When I read the article about the tiger in the Bronx catching COVID19, I was convinced we both had it. My chest was tight, frequent bathroom runs, just pure exhaustion, losing weight rapidly despite being quarantined for a month in a tiny studio- malnourished to the point my hair is falling out. I'm a mess. I guess it's a good thing I got laid off 2 weeks ago, because the bathroom and I are very close friends these days. 

I wake up Monday morning to the pungent smell of my cat's usual poop surprise on the wood floor. He's such a kind cat to poop where it's easy cleanup. That's when I see them - worms crawling around EVERYWHERE. I'm gagging, take a little sample for the vet, and flush the rest. I Dr. Google the shit out of it and it is for SURE tapeworms. Then I read about the eggs. Let me remind you I change my sheets and wash my duvet cover weekly. I make my bed the second I get out of it and even vacuume my duvet cover. I RUN to inspect my bed- there are eggs EVERYWHERE. Little rice demons of hell that have been dropping from my poor cat's bum for 3 months. I'm dry heaving at this point. I live in an old studio apartment and my bed is against a brick wall, so I get little grout crumble patches that I have to vacuume up pretty regularly. I remember feeling little patches of what I assumed one night was grout in my sheets, but fell asleep wine drunk and ignored it. When I tell you they were everywhere, I mean they were everywhere. My pillow, under my pillow- my cat and I fall asleep cuddling every night. Again, I love this cat too damn much.

I call the vet and it is undoubtedly tapeworm. We suspect he's had it since I adopted him. His prescription gets to me within a few hours. I also get flea medication and spray. I check him for flea dirt regularly and hadn't seen anything, but better to be cautious. I bag all of my bedding, throw out half of what I own, vacuum every inch of this place for an hour, I'm on the fucking floor with my flashlight and  find a dead tapeworm under my couch, Swiffer, disinfect my couch, flip my mattress- like total mental breakdown. I give him his medication and his cough stops instantly. He hasn't coughed once since Monday.

This has been one of my childhood phobias since I read that urban legend about the guy who starved himself then put a burger patty on his tongue and lured the tapeworm out until he could grab it from his mouth. I'm thinking about this story after giving my cat his meds when holy moly diarrhea. I look in the toilet bowl to 3 long strings floating on the sides that normally I would have flushed to sewage heaven without second thought, but they are undoubtedly tapeworms. My grown ass calls my mom and sobs while still sitting on the toilet in all of my wormy glory. I call and embarrassingly show the doctor, doctor undoubtedly tells me I too have tapeworm and writes me a prescription. He asks me if I want just tapeworm or a full deworming? I'm like wtf does that mean? He's like, ""You'd be surprised how many parasites are living in you regularly. Just wait and see what you're about to poop out"". I honestly just want to die at this point. 

My cat and I are prescribed the same medication, obviously just different doses and different pricetags. His was $13 for two doses. Mine? $130 for one dose, 2 pills. That's WITH my last month of insurance from my previous employer. I immediately receive a text that my prescription is on back order because of COVID. I'm trying to fall asleep that night on my couch without any blankets, when would you fucking guess it- my heat stops working. So now I'm just shivering on a small ass couch knowing there's worms crawling around inside of me and eggs everywhere. I don't sleep. 

I call the pharmacy when they open in tears asking when my meds are going to get there. Lucky me, they had just arrived. He asks me, ""Did you know your prescription is $130?"" I'm like, ""Uh no I've never had tapeworm, but I guess the price is irrelevant"". We both nervously laugh. I also haven't had an in-person human interaction in a month because I've been self isolating alone and laid off due to COVID, so this is trying on soooo many levels.

I order delivery for a big ass meal from my favorite restaurant because 1. I have no appetite because the thought of feeding the worms makes me want to die and I was hoping ordering from my favorite restaurant would entice me to eat. 2. Medication has to be taken with food. 3. I realize this is the last day  the calories don't matter. Might as well enjoy it. 

I pick up my prescription, light a candle, call my best friend, we have a little virtual funeral for my worms and try to make light of the situation. I play the song I want played at my funeral (Hamburg Song by Keane, it's beautiful). But it just keeps getting worse, y'all. My best friend hesitantly tells me he was telling his physical therapist about my worm saga. She recommended buying clove oil and rubbing it on my pink starfish. I'm like why? Apparently worms like to bite your butt on the way out, and clove oil prevents that. I hate everything at this moment. It's like the different levels of hell. 

I take the pills and am reading the prescription pamphlet. It notes that you'll experience random aches and pains while the worms are dying. Let me tell you- I felt every fucking worm dying as I lay blanketless on my couch in the fetal position. All of a sudden, I'm thinking about the worms and I can't breathe. My throat is kind of itchy, and I'm thinking there are worms dying in my tonsils at this point or I got COVID at the pharmacy. I'm laying there in the fetal position, telling myself it's just a panic attack. My cat decides to go pee at 2am, jumps out startled trailing pee all over the apartment. I know the medication says limit your alcoholic beverages, but I say fuck it and make a drink. I clean the pee and finally fall asleep for about 3 hours.

I wake up bright and early to the smell of cat poop. Still half asleep, I searched his normal spots and couldn't find any poops. He left it in the tub for me- a new spot- thanks, cat. Easy cleanup and no worms- I take it as a win. I flush it down the toilet, bleach the tub, and obsessively wash my hands. 

Let me tell you- my hands are bleeding from the amount of times I wash them between COVID and wormageddon. I look at myself in the mirror while scrubbing my raw hands and holy shit. My face is is swollen to the point I'm still surprised I can see out of my eyes. My tongue is flopping all over the place. I am having a severe allergic reaction to the tapeworm medication. That panic attack while falling asleep was actually an allergic reaction. 

I immediately video chat my doctor, he tells me to go get Benadryl immediately and writes me a steroid prescription. I get a call from their finance department on the brief walk to the pharmacy: $140 for that 5 minute virtual visit. I try to dispute the charge- she can't do anything. I just flat out ask her: ""Can I just tell you about my shitty life then for $140?"". We talk for 5 minutes about how much my life sucks and she agrees. She was very nice about it, but still $140. She basically tells me that if I had waited a month to get tapeworm and almost die from the medication, the virtual visit would have been cheaper without insurance. Fucking love it and American healthcare. 

I cut my losses go back to the same pharmacy from the day before and they ask me what's wrong. I lift up my glasses and they were like ""Ooooof- did you know you were allergic to this medication?"". At this point, I'm like ""WHY DO ANY OF YOU THINK I'VE HAD TAPEWORMS BEFORE?"" Truly, complete mental breakdown. I buy my medication, a box of wine, and $20 worth of candy to ease the pain.

So folks, here I am. Unemployed and alone during a pandemic, clenching my butt like never before, still haven't pooped because I'm terrified of worm kisses on the way out, face still swollen shut, but I'm breathing fine. My cat is a new cat, so for that? I am grateful. I am 100% sure I will have PTSD from this experience. It is going to be a long, long, time before my cat and I snuggle regularly again, but I know we'll get there and I still love him. Adopt senior pets regardless of this story, because 10/10- would still get worms again for him.

Wormageddon 2020 will not soon be forgotten. 

TL;DR My recently adopted cat gave us both tapeworm, I almost died from the meds, and this is my hell.

Edit: I'll come back and give more meaningful update, but I'm reading all of these comments over the phone, basking in the worst kind of Reddit fame with my best friend, and his smart ass says, ""Your tapeworm is going to come out of your butt and ask DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?"" 

But really, y'all are too kind."

We're on a road trip from New Mexico to Mexico. We have a Honda Element converted for living in, so I crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. He stops at a gas station in the desert of Arizona and while he's pumping, I get out to use the bathroom. Come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. I jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. I sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. I reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

I go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. Obviously they do, but whatever. So I start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think I'll steal it I guess. I go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. I realize I don't know my boyfriends number by heart so I just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. He doesn't. I use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when I call.

I resort to explaining to everyone whose phone I ask to use my situation. Some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and I was just being modest. It's been about 2 hours now. The store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, I'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

A cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. I explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. She tells me I can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. I ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. We're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. I just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. And there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

He said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized I wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. And that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. He thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

EDIT: I understand IFU by not relaying my need to pee.
Also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. Also have never heard of this Last Man on Earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. I have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened IRL.

TLDR: went to use the bathroom while my boyfriend was pumping gas, he didn't know, drove off, and I was stranded, asking people to use their phones for hours until police were called to come get me."
arh3qu,TIFU by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life,55473,0.87,5449,2019-02-17 10:00:52,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/arh3qu/tifu_by_not_washing_under_my_foreskin_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/arh3qu/tifu_by_not_washing_under_my_foreskin_for_the/,self.tifu,0,13,,text,True,False,False,"This is long so TLDR at the bottom.

This happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that’s where the pee came out.

So one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that’s certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

So armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom’s bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

After about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I’ve ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. 

I cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.

So this was about 10 days into my stretching and I’d gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I’d try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn’t bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn’t care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn’t budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That’s how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

When I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I’d check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I’m a black guy.

I realized that if I didn’t find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. 

I checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

Also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren’t as stupid as I was don’t take that risk lol

TL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn’t get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

EDIT: So I didn’t expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

So while I’m happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I’d like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I’d like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

For those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don’t be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren’t old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it’s not as awkward that you think. Don’t risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like. "

I found an eight hour video of cats meowing on YouTube that was perfect.

I paired an old phone to the speaker, tossed the phone in a drawer of an empty desk, and tucked the speaker under a ceiling tile.  It was perfect.  You could only hear the cats if you listened real close.  It sounded like there was a cat in the ceiling, but you really couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from.

I went to my office, got busy with work, and forgot about it until I went to break.  I walked into the break room and several people were talking about the cat that must be in the ventilation system.  I chuckled to myself while I grabbed my coffee and made a loop through accounting department to see if there were any more people talking about the cats in the ceiling.  

To my horror, half the ceiling tiles were removed and there were two maintenance men on ladders looking for the cat.  They were real close to the speaker but hadn't found it quite yet.  

I just reversed out of there and went back to work.  They eventually found the speaker, and shortly after everyone got an email from the big boss reprimanding the guilty party and asking for any information on the culprit.  

TLDR - I caused the entire accounting department to be shut down for 3 hours this morning by making them think there was a cat stuck in the ceiling.  
My bad.


Update:

A conspiracy theory emerged by the end of the day. 

Several of them don't believe that it was a prank at all.  They think the maintenance people lied about it being a prank.  That management made it up to get people back to work, and that maintenance  is planning to set out traps and poison to kill it.  One person claimed they absolutely heard the cat yesterday, and I shit you not, a couple of them claim they still hear it."

Been a while since we've gotten tangled up in the sheets, so we decided to give it a go. Things go great, but 30 minutes later my wife thinks she peed herself, so she gets up, goes over to the toilet, and proceeds to leak clear fluid from her vagina. She calls me over to check where the fluid is coming from as she thinks she broke her water (same thing happened about 2 weeks ago, but just a small amount of fluid compared to this). We shrug it off, lay back in bed, and then it happens again. We think to ourselves ""oh shit, this may be real"". Then she starts getting a contraction, not one she normally gets, no, this one is stronger and lasts a lot longer than usual.

4 hours later I sit here in the hospital next to her bed, she's 8 cm dilated, epidural given, and now we're waiting for our 1st child to arrive!

TL;DR fucked my wife into labor 3 weeks early

Edit: here we go, 10 cm, nurse said they're rounding up the troops and will begin pushing soon

o531gm,TIFU by dropping one of the sharpest blades in existence,54943,0.92,2414,2021-06-22 00:47:38,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o531gm/tifu_by_dropping_one_of_the_sharpest_blades_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o531gm/tifu_by_dropping_one_of_the_sharpest_blades_in/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"This happened about 30 years ago when I was doing my PhD in tissue biology.

A little background, in the lab we use something called [microtome blades](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Zl4AAOSwWr5ZxTKP/s-l1600.jpg). For those that don't know, it's a blade that is so sharp it's used to create 1 micron thin [slices](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mousumi-Gupta-2/publication/288835345/figure/fig1/AS:313022531817474@1451641795449/Tissue-block-is-sectioned-with-microtome-fitted-with-a-sharp-knife-The-tissue-is-moved.png) of tissues that are literally less than 1 cell layer thick to be studied under a microscope. So yeah pretty sharp. They weigh a little more than a small kitchen knife, taper out toward the non-cutting end so they can be sharpened for many years. I was taking it back to the lab after it was just sharpened and usually we carry it in a special container, partly for safety, but also if it get's dropped the vibrations will create microscopic bends/fractures in the blade that cause it to cut unevenly and the blade is essentially ruined. As fate would have it, I forgot to bring the case and was too lazy to go back across campus to get one, so I just carried the blade by hand.

Another detail is that since day one of working with these blades, it is indoctrinated in us that we are to never drop them, because they are very expensive to replace. Now-a-days they are cheaper to manufacture and even come as disposables, but back in 1980's money it was several hundred bucks and it would delay your research by several weeks while a new one was shipped.

With that in mind, as I entered the main hallway of the biology department, the blade slipped out of my hand and, in a split second, I subconsciously I reached down to catch it (maybe after it fell about 1 foot). Unfortunately I caught the blade sharp-side-down and it instantly severed three tendons in the palm of my hand. I immediately noticed I couldn't close my index finger, middle finger, and ring finger. It was very strange, because there was very little blood at first, but after 5 seconds bright red blood started pouring down my hand. Before I knew it, the white tile floor of the hallway I was standing on, had a rapidly spreading pool of blood. I all happened so fast I hadn't fully comprehended what I was experiencing. Another fortuitous part of this story is that one of the anatomy professors saw all this happen and immediately rushed over to hold pressure on my radial and ulnar arteries to control the bleeding.

I ended up having surgery to reattach the arteries and the tendons.

After waking up after surgery I was relieved, but noticed they had a blood bag connected to my IV. The nurse said I lost quite a bit of blood and had to be transfused during the surgery. I wish this was the part of the story where I tell you that I had an uneventful recovery. However, after the surgery I started having severe fevers and chills, terrible back pain, my urine was a muddy dark brown color, and I could barely catch my breath. Turns out the lab person who drew my blood mislabeled the tubes and I was transfused with the wrong blood type. I ended up staying in the ICU for a week, almost had complete kidney failure and had severe pulmonary edema. I vividly remember the doctor saying that my kidneys were most likely in complete failure and I would have to have life-long dialysis or a transplant. Fortunately they caught the transfusion reaction before most of the blood was infused and I never had to start dialysis.

TL;DR - Dropped one of the sharpest blades in existence, caught it before it hit the ground, it severed most of the tendons and arteries in my hand. In the hospital I was given the wrong blood type, survived severe pulmonary edema, and almost lost both of my kidneys in the process."

This morning I was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. So I got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. So I said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. After 45min to an hour of fun, I thought I’d never see this dude again because I’m flying home this afternoon (right now).

Wrong. I went to the gate when they started boarding. Guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? You guessed it. To make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and I can hear all their conversations. I’m in the plane right now and he keeps texting. I am saving screen shots in case I need them in the future. I’m sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

This is so uncomfortable.

TL;DR: Hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. Turns out he’s married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

Edit: I gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. He texted me just now telling me he found me on IG and FB so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. Now I definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

Edit 2: A) I’m male. B) The wife does not know. He texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. And then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet I saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) C) I knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

Just wanted to respond to popular questions.

Edit 3: Hope you saw the screen shot, you know who you guys are. :-)"

I have one FU in my life which I find funny and wanted to share. I, being an absolute amateur at reddit with only one successful post in two years, tried to strategize and save it for my cake day.

Clever, isn't it?

So i posted it. It got autoremoved for a good reason.

I fixed it and posted it again, it got autoremoved for an even better reason I hadn't known about.

So I made a post about failing to post to TIFU. Guess what: It was removed for yet another reason I hadn't known about.

I fixed the failed post about failing to post, posted it, and it was downvoted immediately. 

And suddenly I was overly afraid to break another rule I just learned about: that you are not allowed to republish banned content, which might result in me being permanently banned from r/tifu

So i quickly deleted it, like a teenager caught in an awkward situation. seeing only afterwards that I had two friendly comments already.

I am 47 years old, BTW.

I give up posting to reddit.

Not using my main because my FIL knows it and I'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

I went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. I had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when I turned it on. Most of them were asking how I could do this. I had no clue what she was talking about. She didn't answer any of my calls back.

I got home and she was packing up to leave. I'll admit it, I cried. A lot. Had no clue what was happening or what I did. Finally, it comes out that I texted her that I wanted a divorce. She showed me the text and I immediately realize what happened.

This morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. I texted her ""the new mirror came in! I'm going to try to put it together but I may need your help later"". I had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. I texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point I think I need to just give up"". Apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. So my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while I was off thinking everything was great. She even called a divorce lawyer.

Things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. She told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

TL;DR Accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

Edit: Wow, this blew up. To address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-I usually work from home unless I need to meet with clients. I don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. That's why she didn't know I was at work yesterday. I'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. If my phone goes off, I could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-My wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. That's why she had the reaction she did.

\-My comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. Neither of us is mad at the other. This was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. We're fine. I posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. No need to psychoanalyze my wife or PM me about divorce. We are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. We weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night."

“Absolutely! All the time! For instance if you sit in the mall and watch people walk around the mall on a warm day, watch for guys to take one awkward long step. That means there nuts are sticking to their leg and that long step peels them off in a similar fashion and sound as pulling open Velcro.” 

That was almost 8 years ago. Yesterday we were at the mall and she gets absurdly excited every time she sees it, enough to make them notice a couple times and smile and wave like she thinks their famous. And for that, I’m sorry guys. It’s a hilariously awkward thing for her to be excited about, but that’s why I married her.

f1q3dn,TIFU by getting busted by the cops while in my bra/panties after breaking and entering to get my friend insulin,54150,0.84,1611,2020-02-10 18:41:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f1q3dn/tifu_by_getting_busted_by_the_cops_while_in_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f1q3dn/tifu_by_getting_busted_by_the_cops_while_in_my/,self.tifu,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"This weekend, I was in one of my best friend’s weddings. The bride, my friend, is diabetic and forgot her insulin when we went to the church, so technically, diabetes is the villain of this story.

No problem. I volunteered to go back to her house to pick it up. I like a mission. Me against diabetes. After a morning of bridal stuff, my adrenal glands were more than happy to kick some dust off.

The bride says the back door is unlocked, so I dash to her house, drifting the corners (in my mind), finding the apex in the road. The back door is not unlocked. No doors are opened, but I am NOT taking the L on this.

All of us bridesmaids had gotten ready at her house earlier, and one of the other bridesmaids was leaning out her window on the 2nd floor smoking. I gaze up at her window, praying that it’s still unlocked. I know this house. I went to high school with the bride, snuck out of that window onto the roof, and clambered down the tree beside the house many times.

Only this time, I am in a strapless, tight, mermaid style dress. Driving a stick in this constricting skirt was challenge enough. There is no way on God’s green earth that I can climb a tree.

Its barely above freezing, but this is a DefCon 2 situation.

I’m in the back yard, and there is only one house that can see me. I accept the crazy-low odds that the grandparents that live next door will notice me. Decidedly incorrect assumption because apparently, Gramps has assigned himself the position of overwatch.

I kick off my heels, sling off my jacket (it’s barely above freezing), and toss the Morticia Addams-style bridesmaid dress over the fence. I pat my old friend, the tree, and begin to climb. I’m sure I sloth-climbed it, but the adrenaline pulsing through my veins has me convinced that I ninja warriored that shit.

The window is unlocked\*\*. Oorah\*\*!

Once I open it, I ungracefully fall into the room from the roof.  I don’t care because the distinctly male movie announcer voice in my head is sexily broadcasting the trailer for the movie I’m acting out. The crowd cheers when my icicle toes hit the hardwood floors. *I’m killing it*.

The room looks like a girl bomb exploded. Curlers, hairdryers, make-up bags, and clothes cover every square inch of the carpet. I super kung fu hop over the piles to the dresser where she said her insulin bag would be. It’s not there.

I rifle through the piles, shaking like a scared dog from the cold. Nope. To the bathroom. Nope. A massive rock drops into my stomach when I can’t find her insulin. The clock is ticking. I launch down the stairs, two at a time and run through the house as my eyes scan every surface.

I find it on the kitchen counter, a full floor away from where she thought she left it.

Booyow! I’m back in the game. I shotgun pump my arm and grab the bag.

I make sure I can lock the kitchen door from the inside. I mentally check-yep, I left all of my stuff outside.

I step into the garage, shutting the door behind me. As I’m jiggling the locked doorknob, I hear the *Woop Woop* of a police car.

I slowly turn and do some weird half raise of my hands. There are two…TWO cops in the driveway. All official and stern-looking. In a split second, I flash on images. I’m in the back of the police car, handcuffed, search warrants are getting issued. I see the courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury.  In a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, I swear I heard my brain misfire.

The only thing that zaps me back to reality is that I kid you not- my boobs are two frozen ice-cones. I’m going to have the pleasure of explaining this shit-show to the officers while wearing nothing but my fancy thong and lacy, strapless bra because genius me didn’t want panty lines… and my hot-ass guy will be wearing a tux to the wedding. Nuff said.

I could have vaporized on the spot from the humiliation as the officers approach me.

I don’t even know what I said. I virtually shoved the bag of insulin at the older cop and vomited out the preposterous details of this Texas-sized oof that landed me in my skivvies, coming out of a house that I technically broke into.

They try to keep a straight face, but then I start to laugh. It begins as a small embarrassed chuckle, but then it takes on a life of its own, commandeering all of my self-control and flinging it into the icy wind with the ashes of my dignity. I howl. Tears run down my face and I shoot strangled, inhuman sounds at them. I can make no sound other than drawn-out vowels. God, it’s embarrassing.

The cops are trying to ask me questions, and instead, they get Mutley the dog. All I can do is wheeze, or tear and shake from the cold.  Finally, I beg them to let me put my clothes on.

One gallantly swings his arm to tell me to proceed to the back yard to recover my assortment of clothing cringingly clinging to the fence. They are gentlemen about it as I jump and shimmy into this hell-contraption of a bridesmaid’s dress.

They ask me if there is anyone that I can call from the family to confirm the story.

I call the bride. She doesn’t pick up.

I call the bride’s mom. She doesn’t pick up.

I call the love of my life. He picks up on the first ring. God, I love that man. He doesn’t know why I left the church but immediately goes into solve-this-shit-fast mode. He gets the Bride’s dad. It gets sorted.

My guy is waiting in the parking lot when I pull up. Panic rolls across his face when he sees me, thinking I have been crying. I laugh the rest of my make-up off with him when I tell him the story. We’re getting married soon, and I think the bride should have to perform a commensurate task to climbing a tree in freezing weather in her underwear. I’m definitely taking suggestions.

This all happened in a decently small town. This story has ripped through the gossip mill like Taco Bell through the colon. My oldest brother is apparently friends with the “young” cop that I could never make myself look in the eye. Yep- never living this down, and I’m never more grateful to have moved away.

Also, LPT- I’m an idiot, so maybe you all know this, but don’t hand your phone to the police. Put the call on speaker or show the text from your hand. Do not physically place your property in the care of the police. Advice from a law student who was more than happy to lecture me for 20 minutes at the reception.

TLDR; Title says it all. Insulin is a life-saving drug, and at least for one day, I kicked diabetes ass. You gotta do what you gotta do, even if it means being a streaking, Tarzan cat-burglar.

My boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. We got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. We're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. I started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so I figured on going to completion. Unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

So there I am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. His mom comes in! I freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. Meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. Eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

Anyways, it's 5:40am, I've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

TL;DR: Bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

Update @7:31am - Thanks for all the reassuring comments. My bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. Anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. More to come.

Update @8:38am - Of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... Anyways thanks! So breakfast started off totally fine. I mean, yeah I was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. That is, until I excused myself to go shower. She stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. But then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". It was sweet and cringy all at once. I guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

Anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

Update: A lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. Actually I assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); I didn't actually see her do it. I asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while I was...ehm...cleaning."

In my bedroom there’s a ceiling fan that I always have on to try and make my room colder. My room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and I never understood why.

Flash forward to today when I’m talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. I immediately realized my fuck up. When I got home I took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. I hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. I’ve been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. Every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.

TLDR: My ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years"

We have been waiting for our debit cards for 2 weeks. We started a new bank account and had all of our money go into it besides a little bit we get put on a pre pay card. Turns out this online bank does not send out your debit card until you make a deposit (hit a week ago). I am sure it said that somewhere so that is on us. 

Anyway we have been spreading the money we had super thin, and we finally reached a point the we are going to try to Venmo or Paypal again. We tried them early in the week and it would not connect to the other card for some reason. 

My wife get everything set up while I am playing PS4, hits transfer and sends a test 50 bucks, it worked! So this is were I come in, I said you should have sent more. So I take the phone from her and Send $225 on Venmo and jokingly write  ""Sex?"" in the message. Error can not process this transaction, next I get a email saying my account has violated terms of service and it is frozen.

TLDR: We finally found a way to transfer money while we were waiting on our debit cards, I fucked it up by writing ""sex?"" in the message to my wife. Now my account is frozen and we are back to not having our money.

Edit: It was a brand new account, I have never had to use Venmo before. So had I been verified, it probably would not have been an issue.

Update: Kind of anti climatic but debit cards came in today so we are saved. Still have not heard from venmo, so Kanye shrug. Peace out reddit was a blast."
ige551,TIFU By exposing a customers affair to his wife,53360,0.91,1843,2020-08-25 20:47:35,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ige551/tifu_by_exposing_a_customers_affair_to_his_wife/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ige551/tifu_by_exposing_a_customers_affair_to_his_wife/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"(Names changed for the sake of the post) So this took place maybe half an hour ago, and to be honest there's still a chance there will be some kickback for this today. I (25M) work in a call centre, and am doing so for the duration of this pandemic while I wait to find out whats happening about going back to university, its no career but its a pretty nice job with some decent people and its easy, all we do really is facilitate switches for people looking for better deals on household stuff, usually their internet provider or supplier of gas/electricity etc. We have agents in the field who make sales, then call us for verification with the customer, simple right?

Not today. See, usually its company policy not to do call-backs, nobody wants annoying call-centre calls right? So unless the customer specifically requests a scheduled call-back, we just don't do them. I had a customer 2 days ago looking for a pretty pricey internet switch, going from some basic setup to a full TV/Phone/Internet package, the works, all the channels, anytime calls to numbers including international, 500+ mbps wifi, and it came to over £100 a month. I inform the customer, who's an impatient sounding guy, that because of the price increase he'll need to have a quick credit check run on him and it'll mean the call takes a little longer. The guy gets all pissed about being busy and saying he ""can't waste all afternoon on the phone to some call-centre"" so would it be alright if I called him after the weekend to go through it then. Seemed straightforward enough...

This is pretty common, people are always up for the sale until they realise they'll need to spend more than 1 whole minute on the phone, but I scheduled the call anyway and asked if there was a specific time he wanted me to call, he says any time is fine and follows with ""If Emily answers, just ask her for me, she'll make sure I get the phone"" and gave me a home-phone number. Fast forward to today, and I make a grave error.

See, the application I had from the customer had his home phone number already filled in, which it turns out was NOT the same number he'd given me for today's call back. I called the number I thought was correct, and a woman answers. I say without thinking; ""Oh hi, I'm calling for Steve to confirm his broadband switch, we spoke the other day? You must be Emily!"" .....cue uncomfortable pause. She says  ""This is Steve's wife, Amanda. What do you mean I ""must"" be Emily?""

I apologised, and said ""I'm so sorry, when I spoke to him the other day he said if an Emily answered to just ask for Steve?"" And she just goes ""I fucking knew it, I fucking KNEW IT."" and slammed the phone down. After checking the application against the post-it note i'd jotted some info down on the other day, I realised Steve must have given me the number for where he was going to be today, and i'd instead called his unsuspecting wife at home. Nobody's called in to my workplace yet, but if they do I don't think they'll be happy

&#x200B;

TL;DR Customer gave me a different number to his own for a call-back, and I accidentally called his wife and revealed his infidelity

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE! Well fUCK, angry Steve just called my workplace, and has achieved nothing but making himself look like an ever bigger fucking dipshit than he already has, also for the record, Steve was always a dick who can die in a hole, and deserves all he gets, the reason for the TIFU was because I was worried about my job)  So I haven't worked here very long, and am still learning things about company policy, and it turns out that when an application is put through by an agent, it MUST be the applicants own details, according to what they provide the agent. So I was only technically allowed to call the wife anyway, not Emily's home number as he gave me. If he'd wanted the call to a different number, he would have had to have a new application submitted with revised details, it wasn't enough to just give me a different number over the phone, so my job is safe (phew) however my manager isn't happy and i'm getting a write-up, but I can live with that, they don't mean much and i've never had one til now, always on time and have taken overtime voluntarily etc. ANYWAY, this guy phones up and before saying anything else, leads the call with one of my colleagues, who by the way, is a teenage girl in what I think is her first job, and he says ""Put me on with the little f\*cking c\*nt who thought it would be funny to call my wife earlier after I EXPLICITLY told him not too""

Obviously the poor girl was confused, and looked about to ask the room for a manager asap, I immediately piped up and said ""Is it Mr X from \*insert location\*??"" and she confirmed, so I got her to transfer the call to my desk ASAP, Steve comes on the line and goes ""I bet you think you're well f\*cking funny you little pr\*ck, put your manager on the phone and see if you're so smart when you lose your job""  So in my most sarcastic, overcompensating cutesy phone voice ever, I just say ""Of course sir, let me just transfer you to someone who can help"" then put him on hold for 20 minutes hoping it would wind him up even more while I found my manager and told him about the whole situation, he explained what i'd said above that I wasn't technically in the wrong from a legal standpoint, and then my poor team leader had to quickly explain to Steve that he didn't have a legal claim but that we're sorry for the distress caused (sucky I know, but its a business after all) and now hopefully Steve's evening culminates in his entire life being ruined. I got a disciplinary write-up for it but its over now, sorry for the wall of text but thanks for the awards!

&#x200B;

UPDATE 2: For those wondering about the disciplinary, it was a formality and was the lowest possible level write-up my company can give, it was given as a formality because of disruption to the office (the girl Steve called was upset and it became a whole thing) He argued that I still made a mistake but that ultimately I am in no trouble over it, he also cited on the write up that leaving him on hold for so long just to wind him up was spiteful and petty, which, yeah, but Steve deserved it so it be like that

&#x200B;

Update 3: Not a continuation of the story, but thanks so much for the /insane/ amount of awards, (I didn't even know an argentinium award was a thing) I'm glad this story has given you guys as much joy and faith in karma as it has my colleagues and I today, it's spiralled to become the talking point of the whole office today and has been a bit of a scandal! Your support over my write-up is touching, but I won't challenge it, hopefully before long i'll be on to better things and this will just be a funny memory! This has even somehow birthed its own subreddit?? To the creator of r/TodaySteveFuckedUp, a special thanks 😆Thanks again for so much love, you Reddit bunch are the best x"

Unfortunately due to the nature of my work we have to move soon and having a real wedding before then during covid would be impossible. I got off work early today and after getting home my fiancée asked if we could go get some paperwork notarized for our courthouse wedding we planned to have in a month or two. We hopped in the car with a form we printed off the county website and drove to the closest UPS, the notary checked our IDs and had us sign and then she signed, notarized the form, and said congratulations. Cool, now all we have to do is go to the courthouse on a day of our choosing to be wed. My fiancée called the courthouse afterwards double checking to see if we needed to bring anything else and after calling me her boyfriend the lady on the phone corrected her by saying “husband.” She then told my fiancée our state no longer requires a ceremony with the judge at the courthouse. That form is literally the marriage certificate and she is now married. Whoops! We had a honeymoon picnic at a park near a lake

There was a pack of pregnancy strips (I don't know why the HELL these things were there in the first place). So I thought literally nothing and picked up the strips and started reading the leaflet, in the mean time everyone was done and they saw me. I don't know why we all had the same idea and all 15 students picked up a strip and mindlessly dipped it in the urine container, as expected nearly all of them tested negative, all but one

I cannot describe the horror on that girl's face, Like it was really really horrified. She just without thinking took another strip and tested again, Still positive. 

She ran out of the lab rather VERY visibly upset. Me and the other classmates were really awkwardly staring at each other and trying to understand what happened in this turn of events.

bmazsz,TIFU by taking LSD and pretending to be French for 10 months,52911,0.93,2059,2019-05-09 02:50:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bmazsz/tifu_by_taking_lsd_and_pretending_to_be_french/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bmazsz/tifu_by_taking_lsd_and_pretending_to_be_french/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway for reasons.
TL;DR at the bottom.

So this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

About 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I’d finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I’d brought some with me that I’d recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

Things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn’t helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

So I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It’s a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door’s door is about one meter away from mine. I’d not met anybody on my street yet and didn’t realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of “hello nice to meet you, my name’s (her name), are you new to the area?”

So basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can’t speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were “je voudrais une boulangerie” (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn’t handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said “bonjour”, so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I’d just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can’t speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. 

Fast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I’m in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I’ve perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.
I’d gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn’t let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn’t French. If I had friends come over (I don’t have many so it wasn’t too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. 

Things were going okay and I wasn’t too worried about being exposed anymore because I’d gotten so used to it. I’m not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.

But then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn’t recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend “this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about”. You might be able to see where this is going. 

Her friend hits me with a question in French that I didn’t understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn’t know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn’t actually French and couldn’t speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I’d been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

I haven’t spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I’d  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

TL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.

EDIT: I didn’t think this post was going to catch much attention, and I’m praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I’d like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me."

I felt unsafe and canceled. Even after escalating, Lyft refused to refund me. Only after my posts hit 3 million views, did they suddenly try to call me and they offered me my $5 refund.

But get this. Suddenly I'm getting tagged and I discover that their official account has posted for the first time in ages.... and DOXXED me in the thread. Instead of tagging my username, since I posted anonymously, their post reads ""Dear [My real name]"".

And here is the kicker, that is normally a bannable offense. Instead, the comment is removed by the moderators from the thread, but it has not been removed from their profile nor has their profile been banned as a normal user would be. It's still up!

Not sure what to do to get it removed. Any media I can contact to put pressure on Lyft??

TL;DR: Got myself DOXXED by the official Lyft account, which reddit apparently does not want to ban or even remove the comment.

Edit: After 5 hours, they removed my name. One of their execs just emailed me to inform me that they removed it, and suggested I could delete my Lyft account. I suggested they clean up their PR and CS teams because they're not doing so well today.

For your amusement: she is one of the top execs and she is located in the central time zone, so she was doing this at 11:00 p.m. 😂 Sounds like they are finally awake and paying attention. 👋

Update Tuesday morning: the customer service rep (same one who doxed me) who insisted he wanted to speak to me on the phone did not in fact call me at the appointed time. Of course, it's entirely possible that he woke up no longer employed by Lyft."

This dude who looked to be on the older side came in and he wanted to know why his debit card kept declining. So I pulled up his account history and there was literally pages upon pages of online purchases. The gag? Every single one of the purchases was OnlyFans. I guess that he subscribed to many many pages......and the craziest part was that they were over the last few days directly after he got paid so he got a bunch of money then blew it all on OnlyFans subscriptions!

When I saw the account history I pretended to cough because I had the biggest urge to laugh but I managed to hold it in. I asked him if he had online banking or if he’d managed to look at his account history recently & he said no. I offered to print it out for him and he said yes please. When I handed the printouts to him, he just said ahhhh. And I came so close to laughing again but I managed to hold it in and be professional. Then I asked if he made those purchases and he just dejectedly said yes. And. I. Giggled. I couldn’t help it. He gave me this weird look & left. Afterwards I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and laughed it all out of my system.

I guess he called in to complain because after I came from my lunch break my manager called me into his office and now we’ve scheduled a call for HR tomorrow. I’m probably pretty fucked..

TL;DR - laughed at a guy when I saw his bank account history was full of OnlyFans subscriptions and I’m prolly gonna lose my job for it

Update: wow thanks a lot for all your really nice messages. I just got done meeting with HR and I did exactly what you guys said, I took full responsibility for what happened. My manager asked why it was funny and I explained what OnlyFans is and the HR lady burst into laughter. They just let me off with a verbal warning and they said they appreciate the fact that I took responsibility but that I should try better controll my laughter next time, which is definitely fair enough. I’m just glad I still have my job, thanks for the advice from all the lovely redditors and the supportive PM’s that i received :) it really helped cause I was so anxious about being fired haha but thanks y’all :)"

I only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, “What was your most embarrassing moment?”

So I was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing I would get fully sloshed at the party. She was right.

On the way home, I ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. She pulls her light blue Jeep into the parking lot, I stumble out of the Jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

I (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue Jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. “I can’t wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.”

I was not expecting to get hit in the face. I also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming I’ve ever heard in my life. Instinctively, I covered up my face and wondered what the hell I said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

The screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so I couldn’t really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when I heard, clear as a bell, “You fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.”

WHOA WHOA WHOA instant sobriety. I uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although I was in a blue Jeep, it was not my gfs blue Jeep. My gfs identical blue Jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman’s blue Jeep. 

I finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. She convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her.

When I was a freshman at university I had a huuuge crush on one of my lecturers. Who was honestly just a regular looking middle aged man. I was so obsessed with him that I often stalked him online including on LinkedIn, where I made a profile just so that I could stalk him. It was creepy. 

Years later when I joined the workforce and actually started using LinkedIn seriously I realised that people actually get notified every time someone views your profile.

He used to give me odd looks when I would pass him around campus and I used to be paranoid thinking oh god he knows that I fantasise about him bending me over his desk in his office. But then I’d think nah nah nah how could he possibly know that? 

He must’ve been thinking hey there’s that weird girl who used to look at my LinkedIn profile daily. 

He even saw me at my graduation and made a very deliberate glance at me. He. Knows  

TLDR: stalked my professor on LinkedIn without knowing he’d be notified that I viewed his profile"

Basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

Obviously I think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though I've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. So, for some stupid reason, I decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. I set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

After a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after I showed this to him, I saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

Queue my surprise when a couple of days later I check the tinder account I had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and I could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

I confronted him and he denied it but I mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. Obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity I checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. So now the tinder I made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

TL;DR: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

Edit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. It honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

Also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because I’m apparently pretty good at it.

n0qdj4,TIFU by drinking a Gallon of milk in one hour to shove it in Reddit’s face,52246,0.86,2997,2021-04-29 03:50:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/n0qdj4/tifu_by_drinking_a_gallon_of_milk_in_one_hour_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/n0qdj4/tifu_by_drinking_a_gallon_of_milk_in_one_hour_to/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"It’s still in my post history because I am permanently keeping it as a reminder that I’m a fucking idiot whenever my ego gets out of check. 

Okay so this morning I posted on Reddit a conversation me and my friends had in which we all unanimously agreed that drinking a gallon of milk in under an hour is 100% possible and is an incredibly easy challenge. My reasoning was that an entire hour is a lot of time, and that if you just slowly and steadily drink the milk while portioning yourself there’s no reason why anybody can’t do it. One of the lesser challenges was doing a half gallon in an hour and I can say from a certain experience with hot sauce a while ago that I was 100% capable of achieving that so I was absolutely confident I could do two.

I posted it to Reddit, feeling pretty high and mighty of myself on the “unpopular opinions” board and was immediately provided with multiple comments informing me that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. These comments from inferior humans asked me to record my endeavors and I was without a doubt ready and willing to prove them wrong. So I went to my local 7/11, bought a gallon of 2% and got back to my dorm. 

I will give myself credit through my naive ego, I did prepare for the worst a little bit, I sat with a towel bib in case of dribblage and pre-opened one of the shower stalls because the toilets would not account the possible gallons worth milk that could occur from the bovi-licious odyssey I was about to traverse upon. So I turned on my video camera and filled up 5 approximately 25 ounces cups of milk. 

Looking at these completely full cups infront of me, the milk carton definitely tricks you with its sheer volume and I was realizing the challenge ahead of me, but mama didn’t raise no bitch so I went in.

First cup: Totally easy, I love milk, my father, brother and I will go through a gallon within 2-3 days tops, and all I have to do is do this every 12 minutes and I’m home free and all those losers on Reddit will know how cool I am.

Second cup: I down this one too, easy peasy, though the first signal to my brain that I was very much so satiated with my daily value of calcium was already upon us. Though this was a challenge even the greatest often failed at, I wasn’t going to underestimate this challenge, but rather like a matador I will corral this bull with steadiness and finesse.

Third cup: this one I was able to not consistently down, I got about half way through and I had to breathe for a second. But I have a 12 minute window to down this so I don’t have to rush it. The camera is still recording, I wonder if I have to post this full hour of footage to prove it or if I can just skip to each time I drink. Ha. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see I can drink an entire gallon. How much time till my next cup? IVE GOT 30 SECONDS?! 

Fourth cup: OKAY! I FINISHED THE THIRD CUP IN THE TIME WINDOW! The 12 minute mark hit and I didn’t immediately drink it, I picked it up, inspected it’s beautiful color and temperature, and immediately had to put it back down because a certain noise just befell my ears... did my stomach just... hiccup? Me and humbleness have a very long distance relationship, and as the crazy zodiac girl in my nursing classes has informed me, “you totally DO give off Leo energy”. And while my understanding of stars is lacking I think that translates to at this very moment, I definitely have gotten myself into a bad scenario thanks to my ego”. I begin to drink the fourth cup and my stomach is really starting to slosh around, it’s just stagnant and sitting in there and I can feel it truly filling up. SOMEHOW, BY SHEER MIRACLE OR LUCK, I get cup 4 down within the time window with a few minutes to spare. 

Fifth cup: ALL. I. DID. WAS. BURP. A very small burp, but up with it came a mouth full of milk. I realized my fate was sealed. As I swallowed it back down I knew that the second part of the challenge was actually sitting there and not puking as the body begins to naturally break down the lactose and shit in the milk. I haven’t even touched the fifth cup yet, just decided to bring my knees up to my chest to help with the completely full stomach... then, I, very graciously I should add, sprinted like a mad man to the open shower, kneeled on that gross ass floor and prepared for the inevitable. 10 seconds.. 15... nothing was happening... so I slowly got up and went to head back to my room to hopefully finish the challenge, and THEN I BUMPED THE STALL DOOR RIGHT INTO MY GUT. 

In that moment I saw two things, the white of the milk projectile ejecting from my mouth into the shower floor from my rapidly turning head as to not destroy everything. And the vision of God punishing me for the next probably 40 years because I attempted to achieve the ways of the golden calf. 

It is now 5 hours later, and Reddit has won this time with their stupid facts and basic science that I chose to ignore. I am still making frequent trips to the bathroom with generous supplies of dairy for the toilet from both ends. If you need me I will be listening to “I told you so’s” from the toilet. 

Tl;dr: I try to best Reddit by drinking a whole gallon of milk and now my stomach is churning to the point that I may shit butter

Edit: It has been only two hours and so far I have seen many people read this story, understand my overconfidence within it, and then comment that they bet they could personally do the challenge themselves and will be trying soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I am not ill for this world. Thanks guys!

There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

Well this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that's how I roll. A lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so I don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

So I'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn't letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I've been talking to and I told him I don't judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

He kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

Always get a face pic, people.

TL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic

Edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but I'll answer some pressing questions . I did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who I was . It is pretty disturbing to say the least. As far as blackmail goes I have everything saved but I don't plan on doing anything with it as I think that could actually put me in danger . This man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

Edit 2: this was fake . Reddit is gullible and I fucking hate TIFU . It's all fake stories just like twoxchromosomes . Get baited . AMA https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/bgvj1e/i_made_the_front_page_with_50k_upvotes_yesterday/"

Figured I'd tell this story though so here it goes:

I used to date this girl and early on in our relationship we were all about the ""going out to bars"" phase and hanging out every chance we could. Well it was a Friday night and my brother was playing guitar at a bar so I thought it'd be fun to join my parents and my sister and drink and listen to him play. My parents arrived at the bar first, and then my girlfriend and I arrived in my car. We parked a couple cars down from my dads car. There were a ton of cars so we found a spot and nestled right in. 

Cut to an hour in: We're having a grand old time, drinkin and yuckin' it up with my family. Well I look at my girlfriend and she flashes me the, ""sexy eyes"" and of course me being a drunk and horny 23 year old decides to flash em back. So i pretend I'm going outside with her to have a smoke and we go to my car and it's pretty dark out. Noone is around. I triple check to look for people and then when I assume its safe i pull out my log and she starts giving me the ol blowie. 

Now I'm in the car for a good 15 minutes with her and we were both drunk, but not completely useless...but we both must of lost track of time because we were so in the moment that we didn't realize the ""gig"" my brother was playing let out....

I hear the knock on the window first and we both jump about 2 feet in the air in our seats. I look up. My sister starts walking away shaking her head. I see my mom with the most horrified look on her face. My brother is loading up my dads car with his music equipment. My dad just turned and tried to hurry my mom back to their car. Meanwhile my girlfriend pretends to be looking for a contact while I'm struggling to zip up my jeans. 

The next day my girlfriend and I had plans for dinner with my parents. I wanted to get ahead of the situation to gauge my dad's reaction and to hopefully find out what exactly they saw. So I begin to open my mouth when he cuts me off and says ""so we're having chicken for dinner tonight"". ""Cool dad, but <insert gfs name here> is a vegetarian"". And without missing a beat my dad says: ""not from what we saw last night....unless you have a broccoli dick."" Ladies and gentlemen, my father.

Tl:dr - my entire family caught me getting a blowjob from my girlfriend at the time."

It was a sunny day in an otherwise crappy Scandinavian summer. So me and my 5yo son went out to play at one of the city playgrounds. This particular playground has a really cool artificial river for kids to play in. Needless to say, the place was packed. Since my boy was having such a good time playing with his friends, now was a good moment to make my weekly FaceTime-call with my mom.

Hence my error....

Fast forward 5 minutes.... I am still having a nice chat, laying down with the sun in my face. Life is good. When suddenly the sun literally got blocked by four or five moms and dads gathering around me, looking absolutely PISSED. One of the dads says: ""we called the police"". I had no clue what they were talking about. Let alone that they meant that they called the police on *me*. I naively asked ""oh, what happened?"". Replied by ""You are filming our kids without our permission."".... eh, wait, what??

While still on FaceTime with my mom I look over my phone to see what I am actually pointing my camera towards. I see a bunch of butt-naked kids running around, while my own kid wandered off to some other part of the playground. I desperately tried to explain what is going on, and that I wasn't just filming random kids. But I was so stressed that I couldn't find the words (I am living in this country as a foreigner, and don't fully master the language yet). Honestly, if I were these guys I would be darn sceptical of the situation myself.

By now the crowd grew to a mob of 15 people or so. I got up to get my kid, when one of the dads says that I cannot leave without leaving my phone. ""Hell no"", I said. That sobered me up quite fast and I explained in clearer words what is going on. The situation cooled down and most parents walked away. But there were two couples that would have none of it, and demanded me to stay until the police arrived.

Eventually the police showed up and fortunately they were really chill about it - almost laughing when I explained what was going on. They asked me to show my camera-roll which of course showed nothing improper. Also I showed my call history, which indicated that indeed I had quite a long phone call with my mom on FaceTime.

The angry couples apologised, which I appreciated. Me and my son gathered our stuff and immediately went home. On the way home my son asked why everyone wanted to see my pictures..... Oh boy, I can't wait for him to be old enough for me to tell him this story.

TL;DR : Went to the water-playground with my kid, called my mom on FaceTime, and was mistaken by  parents for voyeur-filming their naked kids.

EDIT 1: Whow this exploded! Interesting to see the different perspectives. I guess there are some cultural differences between the nations - which is fine. I don't judge culture.

EDIT 2: Regarding social distancing; Scandinavia is not in lock-down, and (practically) never has been. We have a relatively obedient population where we follow government recommendations without too much questioning. So far we were spared the catastrophe, meaning that our kids can still play in the park. But who knows that the future holds in store... Stay safe everyone!"

I continued using it up until a few days ago, where I finally caved in and ordered a new GTX 1660 S graphics card. Obviously, I expected this new one to be much much better than my previous one. Boy, I was wrong. I felt absolutely no difference whatsoever. 

It was only until then when I realised the HDMI cable had been connected into the crappy Intel graphics card that comes with every Intel CPU. 

tl;dr I didn't realise my pc was connected to the crappy built in graphics card instead of the one that I bought

edit: For those asking if the 1050 is on sale, I'll be giving it to my brother."

Not the most original or romantic approach, I know. Initially the plan was to pop the question over dinner last night, but alas, the build up towards the big moment got the better of me. However, today I woke up determined to do what needed to be done. 

So, there I was, on one knee next to my girlfriend's side of the bed, waiting for her to open her eyes and see me holding the ring. The moment I attempted to wake her up she groaned and rolled over, leaving me with nothing to look at but the back of her head. My heart was beating hard enough to hear. I leaned over my girlfriend and gently tapped her on the shoulder. Instead of waking up like a normal person, she *hissed* in her sleep like a fucking vampire before elbowing me in the face. I stumbled back and dropped the damn ring.

My girlfriend woke up during the commotion and the first thing she saw was me bleeding from my nose. Not gonna lie, when she rushed over to comfort me I flinched. The hissing thing she did scared the shit out of me. After all the drama died down, I managed to recover the ring without her noticing. Speaking of recover, my nose still hurts. 

Tonight I'll try again. This time I'll make sure to propose while my girlfriend is wide awake and still human.


**TL:DR Attempted to surprise my girlfriend with a proposal in bed, but little did I know getting her to wake up required blood.**

This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.

&#x200B;

This happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It's been bothering me enough that I've been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.

&#x200B;

I also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They're harmless, and most of the time I don't even notice, BUT every once in a while...I'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200B;

Well...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It's not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200B;

 I wasn't asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted ""HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!""  She didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""Jesus Christ!"".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200B;

It took me a long time to calm her down, and I don't think that's something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.

dywwwl,TIFU by Scatmanning a girl I was dating,51526,0.83,2808,2019-11-20 10:12:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dywwwl/tifu_by_scatmanning_a_girl_i_was_dating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dywwwl/tifu_by_scatmanning_a_girl_i_was_dating/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,False,False,"
So quite recently I’ve been listening to the song “Scatman”, which for the uninitiated is a dope song of a dude scatting which kinda goes like “scatdobiddlybiddlygiddlydiddlybiddlydiddly...”  and then he says “I’m the Scatman!”.

So I couldn’t get this song out of my head for the past couple days and I was always queuing it up on Spotify. 

Long story short a girl I’ve been dating came over last night and my brain didn’t override my stupidity when I decided to add Scatman to my sexytime playlist. 

When she came over it was pretty much ‘prepare for battlestations’ from the first minute, so I put the sexytime playlist on shuffle. It started off well with some song from the Mezzanine album, and then one I can’t remember and then a jazzy one. By this point I was just beginning to go down on her. 

This is where I fucked up. The Scatman song came up next after the relaxing jazz and it was so fucking jarring. 

I guess a normal person would’ve stopped and skipped the song. I really regret not doing that now. 

Instead of that, without skipping a fucking beat, I started to use my tongue and went down on her at the same exact pace as the dude in the song was scatting. It was so fast that I had to concentrate hard to get the timing right. I know it probably was bad technique, but I started and I had to commit.  
It was probably 9 seconds of doing that before I stopped and came up. I looked into her eyes and perfectly in time with the song I said “I’m the Scatman”.  

I don’t know what expression I expected to see on her, my brain clearly short circuited for me to do that in the first place. What I didn’t expect was the look of pure disgust.  

That moment went in pure slow motion for me. My brain pretty much exploded and was like “ah fuck I can’t believe I’ve done this” 

I saw no means of recovery so I got up and paused the song. And she said “can we just hang for a bit instead”  and I agreed. We ended up watching an episode of Friends, both of us refusing to acknowledge what just happened. Then she said she had to go back to her place.

We’ve only been dating for 3 weeks and I’m pretty sure I might’ve totally fucked this up. At least I have a funny story out of it, though I’d much prefer having a girlfriend.

Tldr: Went down on a girl to the Scatman song and now she might turn into a ghost






UPDATE: Since people have been asking. Nothings really has happened after I texted her “how’s it goin” the next day. Sorry to not have a juicy follow up story. Hopefully we don’t get into the same classes next semester at uni.

If we somehow get back together, I’ll make sure not to remove Scatman from my playlist.

I’m somewhat disturbed by the comments that theorised that she thought I was sexually attracted to fecal matter. I’ll try not to believe it, but looking back on her reaction it does make a lot of sense."

I started talking to a guy on Reddit last week. We hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. We decided to meet for a date on Friday. I have IBS and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. I was also very tired.

The FU: So I'm at this guy's house and I've made us a very nice Mac n Cheese. There was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. We're then snuggling on the sofa and I feel a big fart brewing. I'm hoping I can just absorb it back in to my body if I hold on to it long enough. 

We start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. I choose a 'relaxing' oil. I'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. He starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. I'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

I then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart I have ever expelled. The fart I was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. It was hella loud and it was hella long. And it was right on his balls. It was so forceful, they vibrated.

His response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'At least you didn't shit yourself'.

TLDR: Farted on a first date's balls.

Edit: For anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. You can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!"

I can see how they might think that, but this is a true thing that happened and is happening, and now there is more to it because I actually got broken up with over it. 

With all that is going on, we had stocked up on supplies, including some canned goods. I ordered a few weeks ago 30 cans of beans. 10 are black beans, 10 are kidney beans, and 10 are pink beans. Also, I ordered 15 cans of chickpeas. I thought this is a reasonable amount of beans and chickpeas to have every now and then and would last for quite some time. 

However earlier this week I opened the cabinet because I wanted to make a vegetarian chili using two cans of beans, but all of the beans were gone. What the hell? 

I asked my girlfriend and she told me she buried all of the beans in the woods. 

At first I thought she was joking, but she explained, no, she had buried the beans in the woods. WTF? 

I asked her to explain and she told me she was afraid that ""if things get bad"" we might have to worry about ""looters or whatever"" and that the beans would be in danger of being stolen. I said I thought this was completely ridiculous and unlikely. She became angry at me and said she ""is protecting our beans."" 

According to her logic, the beans are safely buried in the woods behind our apartment complex, and if we ever need some beans she will go to the ""stash"" and dig up a can or two, but would prefer if we save them all for ""if things get worse"". 

I said why only bury the beans, why not bury our more valuable items? She said the canned food was most valuable for long-term means, and that since we get fresh food in our online grocery deliveries, it would make sense to continue to stockpile beans. She intends to go bury more beans in the woods every week. 

This was too insane for me and I got very upset. I demanded to know where the beans were buried, and she refused to tell me. She said if I knew she was afraid I'd dig them up, I said damn right I would. She said ""I will never jeopardize the beans."" 

The following day I tried to put my foot down, and I'm not usually a foot downer but there are rare issues where compromise is out of the question, and I foolishly decided this was one of those issues. I demanded to know where the beans were buried and I told her if she was going to bury beans I paid for in the woods that I would move out. We fought about it and I kept insisting. 

In hindsight I should have just let it go and created my own hidden stash of beans in the apartment, and given her time to maybe cool down about this bean burying scenario, but I blew it all out of proportion. Yeah it's weird to bury beans in the woods but why did I have to press it? What's the harm at the end of the day? In the grand scheme of things? But I kept demanding her to take me to the beans, or at least draw a map or something, and finally she BROKE UP WITH ME. Over the beans. I have lost the love of my life because I couldn't let the damn beans go. I am in disbelief. She moved out. Not only am I heartbroken but I am now paying full rent instead of 50% which is a huge financial issue for me. 

TL;DR - I kept demanding that my girlfriend show me where she buried the beans in the woods and she got so angry at me that she ended our relationship and moved out. My heart is shattered and my finances are jeopardized because of a bean hoard."

We enjoyed it but after a while it developed significant issues and we found it hard to justify the expense of repairing it... we opted just to shut it down for a while. 

Well, COVID hit, and I figured that being in isolation with nothing much else to do is the best time to own a working hot tub. I tried to do the repair work myself, which took a lot of time and stress, and in the end I had to have a professional do it anyways. The process ended up costing almost $2000. But, with no vacations to budget for, we figured it was a good use of our money. 

And it was! We've been loving using the hot tub this winter. We regularly go out there for family time with our kids, who love being able to swim around a bit, and I regularly go out by myself at night to unwind. We have a beautiful park behind our yard that makes it an amazing spot to relax. Because of COVID I've been having long zoom calls with groups of friends, and realized I could do that from the comfort of my hot tub, which just amped up the enjoyment of both activities.

Concurrent to all of this though, my wife and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another baby. The giant FU is that we didn't think, at any point, of the fact that hot tubs kill sperm. Last night as we were discussing our failures in the bedroom, it finally occurred to us that the hot tub might be a problem. I was disappointed, thinking “shoot I guess there will be a few days every month when I can't use it.”

Nope. We looked it up and found out that after being boiled, it takes sperm three months to ""respawn"" or whatever they have to do. 

So until I produce a winner, I am no longer allowed in my own hot tub that I slaved (and splurged) so much to repair. It took us two years to get pregnant with our previous child. Hopefully this one comes sooner.

TL;DR fixed my hot tub, boiled my future children

You guys have motivated me to start writing more. Thank you!

Didn't happen today, but still a bizarre and embarrassing memory that sometimes wakes me up at night.

Important preface: I am ""drive the 1998 honda civic from the trailer park to Walmart to buy a $5 wolf t-shirt"" poor. 

A few years ago, I worked about 25 hours a week humping the grill at McDonald's in a frighteningly small town. When I wasn't on the clock, I was free to drink and mingle with the bottom of the social ladder of rural America. They were actually some of the nicest people I've ever met.

This was a self destructive period in my life. For entertainment, I'd pass the day drinking and crawling through Facebook for entertainment/drama. There isn't much more to do when you live in the trailer park in the middle of a cornfield in the Midwest. Especially when your weed guy is out of town.

I ended up friend requesting a somewhat older girl who was, well, ""trashy hot."" Like a trailer park Emma Watson with stress lines on her face. She seemed... open.

We exchanged pleasantries, which rapidly escalated to us flirting because we were both horny. We flirted for about 2 hours, which escalated to sexting. Through the haze of alcohol and horniness, I was certain that this was the most beautiful woman this side of the trailer park and I had scored big. We scrambled to make a time to meet up and ""chill."" Trailer Emma says ""I'm ready for you now 😏😏"". Now THAT got my warrior to stand at attention.

There was one problem though: she lived 40 miles away, across the county line, and snow was in the forecast. My poor little beater car did not handle snow well. But my dick had been crying out for this woman for hours now. 

So I said fuck it. Took a minute to freshen up in my dirty little bathroom and hopped in the car. Quarter of a tank. That should be enough.

What followed was a long, windy drive through the dark, on ugly back roads. My dick ached from being hard for so long. Visions of passionately porking this woman flashed through my mind.

It took a while to find her house-- er, trailer. It was in a small trailer park basically in the middle of nowhere, way in the back. I had to crawl through the rows of dirty single wides, headlights on high, feeling intrusive and out of place. It seemed that the farther I creeped, the more run down the trailers became. By the time I got to the back, I was passing piles of siding and glass.

I finally get to her trailer. It's... Not great. But my dickbrain is fixated on the night of passion that surely lays before me.

Trailer Emma answers the door. She... Used a much nicer picture on Facebook. Even enrapt in a state of almost spiritual horniness, I could tell she had, well, aged. When she smiled, I noticed several of her teeth were black. My stomach clenched a little. I do NOT do well with bad teeth. 

But the show must go on.

She took me in and briefly pointed out her kids. There were three small, dirty looking children huddled around an old TV. I remember her mentioning being a mom, but 3 kids was a little much... Plus they didn't look cared for. Uh oh.

By this point, a small part of me had already decided that an entire night of love making was off the menu, that I would bail when the fireworks were over. But not before some action. I still thought this girl was hot as long as she kept her mouth closed.

She pulled me into her bedroom-- which had an entire litter of kittens staring at me in the corner-- and started making out with me. Her kisses were way too sloppy and wet. This whole experience was going downhill pretty fast.

My spirit was torn in two-- part of me wanted to bail. The dirtiness, her physical appearance, the creepy trailerpark, the goddamn kittens watching me-- but the other part of me wanted to rip this woman's clothes off and fuck her till her pussy retired and moved to an assisted living facility.

My little head won.

I pushed her against the wall and started kissing her neck. I did my best to avoid her nasty mouth, though she kept trying to push it into my face. Within moments she was naked on the bed, legs spread, waiting for my stiff magic wand. This is what I had wanted, what I had been waiting for, a night of passionate love making with a questionable but moderately attractive Facebook mom, so I thrust my loins forth... and came immediately with a shudder and a groan.

""You came *now?* Trailer Emma said in a disappointed voice that still haunts my dreams. I guess being aroused for four hours can often result in sperm school being let out early.

Now, I'm just a man. This has happened before. Normally I'd take a few minutes to recharge my batteries and get back to work.

Which is what I would have done... Had I not been experiencing the singularly WORST episode of post nut clarity/regret that I ever had in my entire life. Everything hit me at once. Being far from home, at night, in a strange trailerpark. Her dirty, sad looking kids in the other room.  Her meth mouth. Her emaciated frame clinging to a pair of obviously fake boobs. 

It was like the existential dread/paranoia from weed, except it came out of my dick.

Then, I noticed the window. Remember how I said snow was in the forecast? Well, there it was! Fluttering past the outside light like a ghostly interpretive dance of ""your ass ain't going home.""

I immediately hopped up and tried to emit some kind of plausible excuse for leaving. I don't even remember what I said. I do remember her sitting on the bed and giving me a blank stare as I fumbled over words. I felt like the dumbest man in the world. I just wanted to disappear.

I quickly threw my clothes on and stumbled out the door without a good-bye. I start my beater car and try to reverse. But I don't move. My bald tires spin in the mix of slush and mud. I start to panic. I gently depress the accelerator as visions of spending the night with this weird lady and her kids dance in my head. By a miracle of God, the car lurches backwards. I laugh hysterically with relief.

The drive home was long, slow, and dangerous. The snow hurtled past my windshield in silence, my chest heavy with embarrassment and regret. What in the blue fuck was I thinking?? Driving 40 miles in the snow to fuck a stranger in a strange place?? I couldn't wait to get home and forget these awful memories in a haze of pot and PBR.

The first thing I did when I got home was log into Facebook to block my lover. Thankfully, she already had. Then I went to my room and got so, so drunk.

Everything was better till I woke with a fever... Because I had chlamydia... Because I went in on a strange woman bareback. I had to call my gram to pick me up in her nicer vehicle and take me to the clinic an hour away. She grilled me the whole time about why I was going and I had to lie and say I had a sore throat.

The antibiotics they gave me ended up making me incredibly sick so I had to go to the clinic a few days later for a big shot. I missed four days of work and almost didn't make rent.

So, I traded about three seconds of sexual enjoyment for an infected dick, a tiny paycheck, a pissed off gram, and a lifetime of embarrassing memories.

I *did* talk to a social worker at the clinic about Trailer Emma and my concerns about her kids. Not sure what happened after that, but she said she'd look into it...

My life is a little less self destructive these days. I moved to a better town, got a better job, and settled down with a girl. But I will never forget my misadventure with that woman. The memory of revving the engine and not moving is particularly haunting. I may have actually been traumatized a little...

TLDR Drove 40 miles on shitty roads to bang a strange woman, got bad lost but regret and almost got stuck in the driveway, caught an STD and had to miss a lot of work, then I almost missed rent.

All because I couldn't just rub one out.

Edit 2: important clarifications-- yes, not using a condom was incredibly dumb, both for me and for my partner. No, she did not get pregnant with my child. It's pretty easy to check up on people in low population areas. Trailer Emma is fine."

They work.

Today, doing sit-ups on a bench at the gym, I began to feel strange. As I pushed upward on each rep, my body felt and tenser and tenser, like...frustrated and elated, and I was vividly aware of the inseam of my shorts between my legs.

Right before the...peak, I finally realized what was happening. Stifling a moan, I threw myself forward, trying to avoid lying arched and spread-eagled on my back. I ended up crashing to the floor, clutching myself.

Once I could think again, I realized people were running toward me and yelling about seizures and heart attacks and 911.

I curled into the fetal position. I was raised to be deeply, deeply ashamed of every aspect of my sexuality, and though I've recovered enough now to be adventurous IN the bedroom, I'm still a ball of shame in public.

Hearing sirens (my gym is four blocks from the fire station), I wished for death. Finally, when the paramedics were about to grab me, knowing a I couldn't afford the monetary devastation of an ER visit, I sat up and yelled, ""IT WAS AN ORGASM I'M FINE.""

I'm never going to that gym again.

But I am gonna see where these Kegels take me.

 So I sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. I live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... So common that I sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 One particular day I dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that I had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. So as we arrive I mention this to the rider:

Me - Hey I just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

Rider- No, must be the wrong house

Me- Nope, he walked right out of that side door. I dropped him off at *names local bar* His girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (I had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) You guys having a family/friend vacation?

Rider- This is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. Nobody lives here but me and my wife and I've been in NY for work for the past 4 days. 

Awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

He got out and I drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

TLDR- I may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth

* Edit- Thanks for all of the support guys! I know I did nothing wrong, I just hate being involved in other people's businesses, especially when it's so negative. 

 Also - Thanks for the silver and platinum awards!"

So this happened (obligatory ) last night and we are just getting over the laughter. 

My wife and I are early 60s and because of old age, menopause etc etc our sex life has needed medical intervention and a new treatment was suggested to alleviate my wife’s pain during intercourse. 

So ten days ago, jokingly (after a few bottles of wine) we set set an Alexa reminder to announce when the treatment had run it course and we could “officially “ get to it.  We set a reminder. “David it’s time to bonk Fiona”. It seemed bonk didn’t trigger Alexa’s censorship. 

So fast forward ten days.  We had totally forgot this and last night in the middle of a dinner party with several friends we get the reminder. “David reminder. It’s time to bonk Fiona” as you can imagine confusion reined and after a pause in the dinner party conversation questions were asked and our friends joined in on the good humour as we are all similar ages. Pro tip. Everyone gets old, things dint work as well as they once did, but please try and keep your sense of humour.

Edit 1: Thanks everyone some of these comments are hilarious. I played Scotty doesn’t know to Fiona (which I had never heard before) and it’s now her favourite song. Unfortunately none of our friends names are Scotty. 

Edit 2: A gentleman never tells. 

Edit 3: The Aussie use of the word bonk. https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/drive/a-quick-history-of-the-term-bonk/9490694

Edit 4: Apologies for the ugly mug the link dragged in. (Ex Australian Politician)  

Edit 5: Seems a few people are in the same boat. My wife was prescribed Vagisan and Colpotrophine.

Edit 6: Updated TLDR for those not happy with the original

TLDR. During a dinner party Alexa announced “David remember to bonk Fiona” We had forgotten that we set up a reminder 10 days earlier (while drinking a few wines) to remind us that enough time had passed since my wife started her new treatment to sort her soreness during intercourse. Everyone laughed once it was explained."

I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

This is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. 

I now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.

I know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. 

I know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

I know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife’s room.

In reading through the comments he’s made to others, I’ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

Overall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

TL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit. Found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, I shouldn’t have read all of it. And some posts I stayed away from. And honestly, I didn’t realize it right-right away. The first post I read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. It was after another that I really put the pieces together. And yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. But hey, life isn’t always fair. I also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything I read.**"

Throwaway as they use Reddit.

My best friend (m) is married to a photographer, she is actually quite well respected locally and has bad exhibitions... just not quite like this. 

They have a young son who I went round to babysit for while they had a well earned break. My best friend being the loving but incompetent idiot he is, bought her an expensive Polaroid camera which is markedly worse than anything his wife owns. They've given it to their son who has shown no interest whatsoever. 

So I'm pissing around with him, watching cartoons and spot the camera among his things. My friend and I have a childish sense of humour so I take the camera and take a Polaroid of my junk. It turns out horribly blurry, dark and you cant work out what it is. I leave it on my mates desk on his keyboard and forget about it, hoping when he sees it he will get a laugh when he works out what it is. 

Babysitting goes fine, I leave. 

I went round to visit today and immediately saw the polaroid, framed, on their kitchen wall. I absolutely crack up and ask why it's there. His wife replies that ""It's *childs* first photo, he took it and left it on Daddy's desk for him"". She was so proud that her son had used the camera, taken a photo and gave it to his dad that she framed and hung it. 

I haven't got the courage to break it to them that it's not their childs first photo taken, it's my dick.. and they framed it. 

TL;DR: Took a photo of my junk on a childs Polaroid camera and left it around as a joke for my best friend. They mistakenly believe their child likes photography and framed by dick."

My girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said I am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. 

I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.

Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. 

So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?"" 

They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a baked potato.""  And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

And she was like ""A potato."" 

And I was like ""A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. 

They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. 

This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.

Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like ""Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it.""  And I said ""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you."" 

Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said ""Taste's very strange!"" 

That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""What are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

Finally the father said I should ""Get the fuck out of his house"" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. 

I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway. "
b0z6h7,TIFU by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards,50445,0.86,1577,2019-03-14 16:57:05,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b0z6h7/tifu_by_having_the_worst_sex_of_my_life_with_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b0z6h7/tifu_by_having_the_worst_sex_of_my_life_with_a/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of “not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices” and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

Fast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don’t really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.

The first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It’s not good. For six years, I’d still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.

So I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, “hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it’s just me.” Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.

I went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I’d never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can’t remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. 

After my breakup in 2016 and realizing I’d been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.

And so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like “holy fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and “What about this position?” “OUCH!” “Oh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see.” We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

If this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven’t done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn’t felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y’all are when you start out, after two hours, it’s gonna wear off. We both felt like we’d attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. 

Well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it’s about 6am. I’m wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she’s only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.

Well, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we’re engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

TL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we’re engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




EDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. We'll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I've changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn't pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

EDIT2: I guess now I probably have to show this to my fiancée to which she will reply, ""I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?"" I still love her.

EDIT3: A few of y'all keep asking, ""why in TIFU?"" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk

FINAL EDIT: For real y’all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. I told her about this post when I got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when I read it to her. We spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching Labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift Drive-thru theater setup"
k3k18m,TIFU by eating 8 chocolate fiber bars before a long car ride with family and experiencing the most absurd gas leak in history.,50245,0.91,1920,2020-11-30 05:05:13,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k3k18m/tifu_by_eating_8_chocolate_fiber_bars_before_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k3k18m/tifu_by_eating_8_chocolate_fiber_bars_before_a/,self.tifu,0,12,,text,False,False,False,"This happened a year ago, but I just remembered this horrific event and the poor victims that never fully recovered. I was set to go on an 10 hour road trip through the interior of British Columbia and with me were 2 of my cousins and my uncle. However, before our 6am start I decided the night before to wolf down these chocolate chip Fiber One granola bars that had something like 75% of your daily fiber intake. These things were crazy good and I ended up eating an entire 8 pack of them in one sitting. After that I went to sleep and woke up in the morning to a bloated stomach but felt fine otherwise. 45 minutes into our ride the cramps began. My stomach grew larger and larger and I ended up needing to remove my seatbelt, and undoing the zipper on my jeans to give it more space to expand. My cousin next to me couldn't believe what he was seeing, he said it was like the blueberry scene from Willy Wonka. I couldn't hold the gas in any longer and asked my uncle to pull over, which he did and I struggled to get out of my seat as every move was agony. I waddled to the back of the car and let her rip. A thunderous roar escaped me like an asshole racing his Harley Davidson around the block on a Sunday Morning. The gas hissed out of me as my stomach grumbled, shuffled and shuttered. I am not exagerrating when I tell you that this fart lasted AT LEAST 15 seconds. Little did I know that I had just broken the seal and I would proceed to experience uncontrollable and obnoxiously powerful farts that lasted 10-15 seconds on average, with only a brief period of relief between said farts. 

The fact of the matter was that I was now experiencing major flatulence every 2 to 3 minutes, and we couldn't stop the car every few minutes to escape the smell, so we decided to roll all the windows down and allow me to let loose whenever I needed. However, we had no idea that this would become a much longer ordeal than we initially thought. Truth be told, I couldn't stop farting for nearly 7 hours, and each fart just HAD to be more epic than the last. By the time hour 2 rolled around, my anus was sore and aching, and my insides feeling like shards of glass were ripping through me. And the smell had become so overpowering that we had to stop at a gas station and buy as many air fresheners as we could. I took one of the air fresheners and sat on it in the hopes that each fart will be freshened up - instead it just smelt like rotten eggs and pine. My cousins and uncle resorted to using Vicks around their noses to stop the smell. The pain from constantly farting brought me to tears at one point and I realized how ridiculous it must look to see a grown man crying while farting non stop.

At hour 4 disaster struck. I stopped farting, but I was still swelling with gas. I knew I was plugged up and if I didn't do something soon the pain is going to become unbearable. We stopped at a Coffee Shop and I ran in to use the bathroom. I gingerly sat down on the toilet and gently pushed but the pain was too much. I resorted to pushing on my stomach to help things along and suddenly I felt this wave of pressure hit me that made my butt cheeks break into a cold sweat and start to tingle. Suddenly, and without warning, a rock hard turd rocketed out of me like a cannonball and plastered itself to the back of the toilet bowl, and with that this tidal wave of what could only be described as peanut butter oatmeal. I could feel the muscles in my abdomen squeezing my intestines so hard that it actually hurt. It was like when you are throwing up and you can feel your stomach violently squish itself to push everything out, but instead it was my butt that was throwing up. Once everything was pushed out it was topped off by the longest fart in my short, pathetic existence, one that I could never accurately give the length other than say well over 20 seconds, and that I could literally feel and see my stomach shrinking. I destroyed that poor coffee shop bathroom and I frequently wonder what happened to the person who wandered in after me.

From that point forward the farts were just as frequent and long, but they felt cleaner and less restricted. It began to feel like I was airing my colon out, blowing out all the accumulated dust. My ribs and anus ached horribly, but I was starting to feel euphoria wash over me that I assumed was just the endorphin rush my body was giving as a way to protect my fragile mind from this ridiculous ordeal. By the time hour 7 rolled around my farts had slowly faded away, but the smell permeated my clothes and the seat behind me. The family had gone through almost an entire container of Vicks, and they appeared to have survived the ordeal but I could tell that a part of them was broken that could never be fixed. It was as though they felt violated by having to breathe in my butt breath for 7 hours, and I knew my uncle was upset that his car's interior would never smell the same again, as it already smelled like hot garbage by this point.

We eventually arrived without incident, and we refused to speak of this event. Things were never really the same between all of us after that, and I have a feeling none of us will ever touch eggs ever again. They already ate enough of my farts, they don't need a reminder. I should have never eaten that much fiber. I had no idea it was capable of that.

TL;DR -  I ate too many fiber bars and ended up gassing my family nearly to death over 7 hours in a car. I made the scientific discovery that your body can produce ridiculously large farts at an alarming rate. 15 second farts on average with an average rate of 1 fart every 3 minutes. That means I was farting an average of 300 seconds an hour, or 2100 seconds over 7 hours. I farted for 35 minutes. LMAO

Edit: I am glad that we can all laugh at my Fart Attack and the pain and suffering that comes from it, but please don't do what I did. I was a dumbass that couldn't stop eating chocolate, and what I did was dangerous. I'm certain you will only hurt yourself if you attempt this so please do not try this.

Also I meant to individually thank people for awards via inbox but I lost count after 30 and decided to just say thank you from here. Thank you, from here."

I work at a popular coffee shop in canada, and have been for the last two years. Most customers who come here a lot dont have to order, because we already know it. One guy who comes in orders something distinct, and was very nice to me when I first started.

 His order was the first I memorized. For example, he orders a large and a medium coffee, but sometimes would just get the large. He came in today for the first time since I started working again from quarantine. I told his order to the girl working the counter with me listing the large and medium coffees, but he ended up just getting the large. Afterwards, my manager told me he wasnt getting the medium anymore because it was his wife's order AND SHE HAD PASSED AWAY. 

TLDR; I put in the coffee order for a regular that included his deceased wife's regular drink."

Last week I booked a fight to see my boyfriend who lives 3 hours away. I don’t drive at the moment so I decided to take a flight as it’s only 40 minutes or so, and it was only €15. We haven’t seen eachother for 3 months because of covid so we were both very excited. Now, to spice things up a lil I decided I will wear lingerie under my regular clothes, as he lives only 10 minutes away from the airport and I thought I could surprise him straight away. I also decided to spice things up a lil and wear a buttplug, not even thinking bout it, so I put it in right before leaving for the airport, I’m gonna spare you the details but it’s a small one so easy to go along your day with. 

Now, I get to the airport, and while I’m going through the security the things beeps which isn’t a surprise since I’m wearing light jewellery so I didn’t think much of it. The woman tells me to step aside and shes just checking my pockets etc. I take off all my jewellery and try again but the thing is still beeping, and now, I’m only wearing sweatpants, a hoodie, and lingerie with no extra details. So I’m standing there when the woman tells me to go onto an expectation into one of those machine x-ray type things when to my horror I remember I’m wearing a butt plug with a HUGE jewel. Which I completely forgot about. At this stage I am mortified and tell the woman what’s going on. Luckily she just laughed it off and let me go.I have NEVER been this embarrassed.

TL;DR I wore a butt plug to the airport and got stopped.

Edit ;for everyone asking how I could’ve “forgotten” it there. It’s not that I forgot that it was there or I didn’t feel it was still there, I just got used to the feeling and my mind wasn’t on that when I was entering the security."

This was supposed to be the ultimate pièce de résistance to my awesome new home office. It took a few months to ship, and when it finally did, I was pretty unhappy with it. First of all, there was this big crack behind it, bending the metal in an unsatisfying way, but it wasn't that noticeable so I didn't bother sending it back. The worst, though, was that it was near impossible to write on it without leaving ghost marks. And you can forget about letting some writing on it more than 24 hours.

As a result, I wound up not using it for most of the last year. Basically, his only purpose was as a magnet holder, when it should have been used for so many different projets. 

Today, as I finally had some free time, I looked into the process of cleaning my whiteboard, and making it more usable. As I applied some store bought cleaner, I found this small tear in some kind of plastic coating. I freaked out, ripped it all out and came to the horrifying conclusion that I spent 1 1/2 years writing on plastic.

I now have a brand new, unused board that has been sitting in my office.

tl;dr: bought a whiteboard, forgot to take the plastic layer off and took way too long to figure it out

My oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



I get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



We discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......



I walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



What i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



So no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



So my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.




TL;DR  Didn't tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game



edit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

Update: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    Son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

I’m a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship “assisting” on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. In this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. If you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. As this was my first laparoscopic surgery, I soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. Like many of you, I had no idea this role even existed, but I quickly accepted my new job as ‘vagina sealer’. I approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. I placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. After several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  The attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said “do you know where the vagina is? Get that stopper out of her ass!”

Thank you for reading. I’ll go die now. 

TL;DR  couldn’t see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum"

To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go.

Anyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

This goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*Explains above about material*
Prof: ""What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?""
Me: ""No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?""
Prof: ""Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.""
Me: ""It literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*Shows syllabus*
Prof: ""Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
Me: ""What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?""
*Prof starts laughing*
Prof: ""Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.""
Me: ""Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

I then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing ""This is a new one for me."" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!

Tldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.

Edit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.

2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.

Thanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

Edit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam."" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - CZ

z8tw8l,TIFU by purchasing an expensive coffee machine and making a terrible discovery,49722,0.85,2867,2022-11-30 20:40:05,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/z8tw8l/tifu_by_purchasing_an_expensive_coffee_machine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/z8tw8l/tifu_by_purchasing_an_expensive_coffee_machine/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"I drink a lot of coffee. My mornings consist of two 300ml mugs of coffee, and I sometimes have a third after dinner later in the day. 

Recently, I got far too into James Hoffmann's videos and decided to upgrade my shitty drip coffee machine for a proper precision brewer. And when I say precision, I mean that this thing comes with a water testing strip so you can calibrate the machine for the mineral content in your water supply. Serious nerd shit. 

To justify the ludicrous amount of money I spent on what appears to be the Hadron Collider of coffee machines, I did some research on brewing ratios in order to maximise the allegedly life-changing potential of this equipment. Now, coffee science says the ideal water-to-beans ratio for this brew method is about 60g of grounds per litre of water. Out of interest, I decided to prepare my usual ratio from the old machine and see how close I was. It turns out, since I got the old machine just over a year ago, I've been brewing at about 20g/litre, resulting in what I now realise is pathetically weak brew. 

I prepared a proper 60g/L brew with the new machine, and the resulting coffee was on another planet. The flavours were so developed it was like I could taste the touch of the Colombian farmer who picked the beans. I drank my full morning dose of two 300ml mugs in just over an hour. 

And then, I discovered an unexpected side effect. 

The year of drinking weak-ass brew has conditioned my body for weak coffee. And I had just drunk over half a litre of coffee that was theoretically three times as strong as usual. 

It has now been an hour since I finished that first pot and I can hear the passage of time. A fly flew past me in slow motion. I made an omelette for lunch and I beat the egg so fast it turned into steam. My heart no longer beats; it vibrates. And there is something unholy brewing in my lower intestine and I am fearing the wrath of God when it is released. Send help. 


TL;DR: My new coffee machine gave me the knowledge that I've been conditioning my body to piss-weak brew for a year, and two cups of the real strong stuff made me transcend the space-time continuum.

EDIT: 

[Here](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bdc450.html) is the machine I bought, for those who have asked, although it appears to be sold out at the moment. Did I get the last one? 

And [here](https://youtu.be/HfkdkZRv6Mc) is the James Hoffmann review that convinced me to ruin my life in this particular way.

EDIT 2:

To everyone accusing this of being some kind of viral ad, it's true. Sage paid me, and in fact specifically requested I include the details of me plastering the inside of my toilet bowl following the intestinal catastrophe their product gave me. Aggressive shitting is exactly the kind of PR exposure they want for their brand."
gk7wiu,TIFU by hiding in my girlfriend's room when her strict Asian parents suddenly came home,49615,0.83,2309,2020-05-15 17:37:27,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gk7wiu/tifu_by_hiding_in_my_girlfriends_room_when_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gk7wiu/tifu_by_hiding_in_my_girlfriends_room_when_her/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Long time Reddit reader, first time making an account because i am currently stuck in my girlfriends room while she and her family are having dinner downstairs. I haven't eaten since morning nor showered and I need to take a shit.

Back story to this morning, since the lockdown for covid 19 happened, I haven't seen my girlfriend for over month plus. Our government recently relaxed the quarantine so we are allowed to go out but not loiter. Woke up to my girlfriend's call around 11am saying that her parents went out to get something. I thought okay I'll come over, return her a camera I borrowed and maybe we can sit in my car around her neighbourhood and hangout awhile. It was a little rushed as her parents just left her house as I left mine. I'm about 20 min away from her place. She assured me her parents will be out for at least 1 and a half hours as they need to get lunch. I drove as fast as I could and picked her up from the front of the house and we drove to park nearby to hangout. After a couple of minutes, I ask if she brought some water as I asked her about it before I came and she said no. She said why don't you come in and take some water since her parents will still be far away. I said yes (obviously) and went in, drank water and we sat on the couch for awhile to cuddle. 

I was a little paranoid but I haven't seen her in a long time so i needed it. About 10 min, we hear a car outside her house and that's how tifu, it was her parents. They were only out for 40 min. FML we panicked. Luckily I parked away from her house and took my slippers in. I contemplated just owning up and lying that I needed to use the toilet but her mom is really difficult. She would assume my girlfriend was lying and get her trouble and I haven't even met her parents officially as her boyfriend yet. If you are from an Asian family or have heard of asian parents being strict about relationships, it's true.

We both ran up to her room and I hid behind her door. Mind you, her room is really small. Its about the siZe of two single beds. Can't hide under the bed as she has to keep her door open and you can see straight under her bed from the stairs. The only place possible is behind her door. I stood there frozen af as she went down to greet her parents. I could here them coming in as I hugged the wall as tightly as I could. 

She came back up freaking out but I said it's okay. Let's just try formulate a plan. She said okay and she went down to eat with them first. Which I had then had to stay as silent a possible with no fan or air-conditioning so I sweated my ass off. 

1 pm ish. She comes back up and we try to listen whether her parents are coming up or not. They usually sit downstairs after lunch and nap, which they did. Gave me a little bit of relief as I could sit down in the floor. The space in between the door and her table is super tiny which is uncomfortable but I'm not complaining. 

2pm. Her dad comes up to shower and her door is right next to the bath area. Fuck I can hear the water rushing. But good news my girlfriend is in the room doing her work so she can look out. Its weird as I'm just standing up behind the door and looking at her look back at me. After his shower, her dad leaves to go to his store which leaves her mom downstairs. She gets on a long phone call which gives me a bit of room to relax. My girlfriend and I make out a bit to calm our nerves and I gotta say it did help. 

For the next three hours, her mom stays downstairs and we try to formulate a plan but everything involves the timing of her parents which is impossible. Can't jump out the window cause it's grilled and she doesn't have the key...

Around 5.30pm ish, her dad comes home and almost fucking COMES INTO HER ROOM. He asks her to print something and she quickly walks to her door to stop him from coming in. I hear his voice right outside the door. Thankfully he walks away and goes down to watch TV. And I swear to god the universe wants us to suffer because right after that her mom comes upstairs and hangs about the common area. My girls had recorded a zoom meeting so she tells her mom she has a meeting and plays it and closing the door giving my legs much needed rest and I sit.

7pm, her mom calls her from downstairs that it's time to eat. And that's where we are at now. Its currently 9pm at this sentence and I can hear her family talking to each other. She has to turn off the lights and fan and air-conditioning so I'm freaking drenched in my sweat in the dark. I'm sitting down but I've got pins and needles in my feet now. I would stand up but because the area is so tight, I don't want to risk any noise. Oh remember how I haven't eaten and need to shit? That's attacking now. My stomach is growling and I'm making fart noises. I'm so scared to be caught cause my parents are gonna slaughter me too. My girlfriend and I will discuss our plans for me to escape when she comes up...

UPDATE 1: they are done with dinner. My girlfriend brought me some water and biscuits but I don't have the appetite to eat. Don't want to drink too much as I would risk needing to go to the toilet. She went back to do the dishes

UPDATE 2: its 9pm and my girlfriend is in her room. She told her family she is playing animal crossing with her friends so hopefully her parents don't barge it. We're gonna formulate a plan for me to escape now. I can finally stretch my legs

UPDATE 3: WE HAVE A PLAN. 9.30pm
We're going to wait for their parents to head up to their room. She's going to check if their door is closed and where they are looking at it. She'll bring me downstairs and I'll hide in the storeroom. She'll then go and tell her parents she's taking photos of the night and no worry if the door alarm rings (cause they have an alarm system in place). She'll unlock the main door, the outside small gate and leave it open for abit (gated and guarded area so it's pretty safe). She'll go check on her parents as they like to look at what she is doing from their room. Once she's confirmed they are not looking, she'll get me from the storeroom, I'll go all the way out and hide behind a pillar in front of her house. She'll lock everything and go back up and check her parents are not looking out and I'll walk to my car (so I don't startle her dog). Sounds pretty legit as she knows her parents schedule the best

UPDATE 4: 9:41 pm. Showed my girlfriend this post and we're reading the comments. Really means a lot to us that everyone is supportive. Makes the nerves less frightening. We're hugging it out and playing Animal Crossing till her parents go to sleep at around 11

UPDATE 5: I'm still here and it's around 10.30. my time zone is GMT +8 for those who are still invested. We're just preparing for when her parents go to bed so we're trying to calm our nerves
 
UPDATE 6: it's 11 but her parents are not sleeping. For some strange reason her mom decided to bake at like 10.30. starting to think they suspect something 

UPDATE 7:SHIT YES! my gf just went to down and her mom is done baking and says she is going to sleep soon. Which just leaves her dad still watching TV. I'm almost out I can feel the wind already. Just can't get too trigger happy and jump the gun. 

UPDATE 8: FFFK. her mom just walked past her room. Heading into her own room. Her dad also getting ready to sleep. Shit is about to happen guys. Phase one of our plan is about to commence! 

UPDATE 9: damn, her mom went to bed but her dad is still watching TV. It's like 11:30pm and he is still watching? At least her mom is in her room so that is good.

UPDATE 10: OKAY plan is in action. Her dad is now in their room and she is moving my stuff downstairs to the storeroom. I'll update once I'm inside

UDPATE 11: took my last sip of water and went down to the storeroom. Phase 1 complete. Her dad is showering, her parents door is closed. Now for the front door and gat

upda12: gf opening the door and the gate. I have to wait for her

13: slight change, I went out the door together with her. Her dog isn't barking so that's good. She has to open the gate

14. Out the gate. Bending down. Waiting for her text me

15. She's taking some photos to sell the story. Better not rush it. Her dog is getting very close to me and sniffing me thought the gate. Oh god please don't bark

FINAL UPDATE:

FUCKING HELL GUYS. I made it. I just started the engine and my heart is pounding. I'm safe and sound. TIME TO GO HOME. Got out 11:53

POST CLARIFICATION:

Its 12.15am, I'm home sipping a hot cup of Milo and laughing with my girlfriend about the entire day. We just wanna thank everyone that supported us and this shitty situation we put ourselves in. The nerves were real and seeing how everyone wanted the best for us really helped us push through this emotionally. Wanted to clarify a few things for quite a number of questions:

1. A lot of people were saying this story is a fake a similar to other ""stuck in ___ room with family in house"". Unfortunately, Asian people go through similar things and this is no exception. The strict family and rebellious child senario. Same coin, different sides.

2. A few people mentioned how this is similar to another post a year a go and truth is, I was inspired by that post to share this story. It was a very emotionally troubling time for both of us and after reading the mentioned post and seeing how supportive everyone was and how it made the OP feel much better, I thought it would a good idea for my girlfriend and I to do the same. And it did! It honestly helped us feel like we could make this work. I'm really sorry I can't prove it happened but this was real to the both of us and that's more important.

3. We own up to this mistake and that's why it's on tifu. We fucked up big time and have only ourselves to blame. But we survived it learnt never to repeat it again. 

ADD:

4. Situation happened in Malaysia. Its a very hot and humid country so it's very common for people to shower more than once or twice a day and sometimes before we sleep.

5. We're Chinese. 

6. This is the most amusing part and I'm glad everyone was worried about it: yes. I did take a shit after I ate. It was brutal. Constipation due to the lack of water. Not only were my legs shaking, my asshole hurt too. Not fun.

7. 4pm (next day) Oh god, this is still going on in the comments but I wanted to add something after my gf went through the comments. To those who opened up about similar stories about hiding or having strict parents (i.e. no friends over or always under watch), it really meant a lot to her that there are other people who go through the same thing as her and I would like to thank you for sharing! She always felt like the odd one out of her friends. Not being able to go out, tight rules etc and it's good to know she isn't the only one. Some people don't understand this and that's fine. Everyone grows up in different scenarios. Its not that she doesn't love her parents less, it just sucks to be in her situation. I wish I could give her more credit for what happened last night. She risked so much just for us to see each other. 


Thank you again for investing your time in this. Didn't expect it to blow up like this but you guys helped us a lot. Time to sleep now. Good night everyone!!!

She took my phone, logged in and sent a few messages and then logged out and gave me my phone back.

The TIFU started around 20 minutes later when I started receiving notifications from Reddit for posts that I can't remember visiting, they were also NSFW so I went to the bathroom for some privacy to see what the posts were about and to turn the notifications off.

The notifications were messages and comment replies from a NSFW amateur subreddit, curiosity got the better of me and upon clicking onto the post, there was my younger sister naked!

I immediately closed it and decided to logout of her account but realised her account wasn't logged in, it's some sort of bug with the Reddit app that causes me to receive notifications for an account that has recently been logged in on my phone.

The notifications are still coming through thick and fast and I've since realised my sister is quite a popular amateur pornstar on Reddit and I wish that I never found this out.

TLDR: Let my younger sister use my phone to check her Reddit inbox, found out that her side hustle is that she's a popular amateur pornstar on Reddit and I'm getting notifications for comments on my sisters vagina."

okay so for a bit of back story I’m 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we’ve been together for 2 years now and through out that time I’ve seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they’re usually travelling so it’s a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We’ve also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

So on top of making porn I’m also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I’d been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I’d always got the vibe they didn’t like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that’s not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

I panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn’t want her dad getting us sick also.

Her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I’ll keep you updated if anything else happens 



TL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won’t talk to us"
jpuuef,TIFU by telling my dentist Joe Biden won the election.,49180,0.78,2096,2020-11-07 23:25:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jpuuef/tifu_by_telling_my_dentist_joe_biden_won_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jpuuef/tifu_by_telling_my_dentist_joe_biden_won_the/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Edit: Edit: I spoke up and got more numbing agent after like two minuets. It’s in the other edit, but I’m putting this up here for visibility since it’s come up in a lot of messages. Also, all y’all getting political and sending angry PMs, chill.

I have been following the election all day, every day waiting for a victory announcement. I had an appointment this morning to get a filling replaced and of course, the second I leave my apartment the fireworks and cheering start so I check my phone and lo and behold Biden has claimed Pennsylvania.

Anyway, I finish my walk to the dentist's office, I'm in the chair, and the dentist and his assistant come in. I just say, ""It looks like they've called the election for Biden"" with no indication of preference one way or another. I was going to mention how I missed the news announcement and leave it at that. Instead, as soon as I mention it the dentist gets a look of total defeat on his face and then starts going off, calmly, about how the machines were having errors in MI, fake ballots, voter fraud, and having to recount all the states or something. At this point he has proceeded to drill my mouth, not fully numb, ~~terrified and~~ in pain.  ~~I've never been more scared in my life~~  worried that I upset the guy working on my mouth. (edited again for clarity)

TLDR; I upset my dentist right before a filling by telling him Biden won the election. It hurt.

Edit: So this exploded. Also, I just want to add based on a lot of the comments, the dentist was never angry or malicious. They were just calmly explaining their “theories” while operating, to the assistant. Definitely distracted, which is why I think I didn’t get enough numbing agent at first, but nothing to file any complaints about. I also asked for more numbing agent after a few minuets and things were fine after that."

Masturbated in the shower this morning. Vigorous stroking triggered an asthma attack. Asthma attack prompted me to exit the shower. Exiting the shower ended with me slipping and falling on my face. Called my roommate for help. Roommate found me naked on the floor, struggling to breathe. Cue roommate retrieving my inhaler. Inhaler failed to do the job after multiple attempts. Condition worsened.

Ambulance was called. Roommate awkwardly helped me into my clothes. Paramedics showed up and put me on a nebuliser. Nebuliser helped me breathe, but little did I know the worst was yet to come. Paramedics said I had a fever and transported me to hospital. Hospital flagged me as a potential Covid case. Got placed in quarantine by nurses dressed up for Chernobyl. Got treated for my fever and tested for the virus. Speaking of the test, never again do I want those long ass swabs shoved down my throat again - it was so damn deep it practically touched my brain. Doctor conducted a thorough checkup. I winced when said doctor pressed on my stomach. Doctor narrowed her eyes and asked what the colour of my poop was. I said ""kinda dark but, you know, not outer space dark"". Doctor said ""hm"" before proceeding to spread my ass cheeks and jam her lubricated finger into my anus. For the record, that finger was thick as fuck and it happened to be the first time ever something penetrated me down there.

Got discharged with a laundry list of prescribed medications and advised to self isolate until I recieve my test results. As of today, the thought of fapping has become nothing more than a source of nightmare fuel, and the feeling of being finger fucked in the b-hole is yet to disappear. 

**TL:DR Fapping triggered my body to self destruct. Now I might be positive for the virus while having a phantom finger stirring the inside of my asshole, as well as World War 2 level flashbacks every time I wanna bust a nut.**"

Ohhhhh where do I begin. This happened this weekend.

Let's lay out some plot points first..

\-I'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.

\-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-I've always worked out, done yoga, I'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I've done it a lot and I know what I'm doing, lol.

&#x200B;

OKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan. I was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200B;

There are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. This way, I would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. But the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (I can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200B;

So the day comes, I have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. By the time I arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. I prepare myself with the girl I'm dating, and she invites her friends in. They are hooting and hollaring as I'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. The whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, I'm really into this idea now.

&#x200B;

I throw my legs over my head as I've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... I circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. I put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and I hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. I'm trying to look back to see them, but I'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. I start getting more and more into it, and the girl I'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. At this point I'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. The girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200B;

After a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""Cum in your mouth! Cum in your mouth!""... Now to be clear, I normally don't do this. I have before, lol, but it's not my thing. But I'm the entertainment, and I aim to please, so in my mind I'm thinking lets do this. I start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. The girl I'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. The whole thing is so hot and I feel like I'm about to cum, and.....explode. It was a lot. I'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. The girl I'm dating let's go of my legs and I fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. Her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - I'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. So I stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and I look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. My assistant.

&#x200B;

She leaves the room, I race to the bathroom. The girl I'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and I tell her. She loses it laughing - ""SO AND SO is your assistant?! AHAHAHAH"". I'm not laughing. Assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200B;

It's actually a bit of a scene, the girl I'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling Assistant and she is not answering. The girl I'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200B;

I've been working from home all week. I've talked to my assistant via Slack and we've said nothing. She is in the office. I can't work from home tomorrow. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. The girl I'm dating said that Assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. I really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200B;

tl:dr - I sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. We haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  [The diagram](https://imgur.com/a/rR31eBi)!  I'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  I'm not a turkey, I promise.

EDIT 2: To clarify, I don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  I think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  The diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until I stood up.  At least this is the logic I am convincing myself of.

EDIT 3:  I'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl I am dating"" because honestly I wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  I don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

EDIT 4:  Yes, they were staring at my butthole.  I'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. To be honest if,

EDIT 5:

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts.  No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement.  A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  Better than jerking off that's for sure.

And yes, I have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

So this morning I woke up after a night of drinking together and say good morning to her and her response was “do you remember what happened last night?” And I’m like “oh yeah that was such a fun night!” And she’s like “well I’m sure you don’t remember peeing on me then” and I am just so taken aback by this. I thought maybe I had pissed the bed or something for but no, it was worse. Apparently, and I have no recollection of this at all, she got up to go use the bathroom and like a minute later I stumble in there and she’s sitting on the toilet and I just pee like she wasn’t even there. Obviously this is a surprise to her, I mean who expects that!? But she said that she just took care of me and got me back to bed. luckily she’s really great and we can just laugh about it! What a way to wake up though
TLDR i got drunk and whizzed on my girlfriend while she was on the toilet and don’t even remember it

Was going through some project details with one of the engineers before she left to go to a job site. 
We wrap up, she gets up to leave, and I attempt to say “go spread your wings”. 
But right as the word “go” comes out of my mouth, my brain decides now would be a terrific time to switch things up and say “go stretch your legs”...
And before I knew it I was having an out-of-body experience watching myself tell her to “go spread your legs”. I will never forget the look on her face. 

I immediately told her what the hell my brain just did for that combination of words to come out of my mouth as she is on her way to a worksite full of men. And thankfully she believed me (seemingly) and laughed it off. Doesn’t make it any less embarrassing unfortunately. 


TL;DR - Told a woman I work with to spread her legs by combining two innocent phrases."
hj0tcn,TIFU By Realizing What Christians & Muslims Actually Believe In,48686,0.8,6906,2020-07-01 07:03:39,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hj0tcn/tifu_by_realizing_what_christians_muslims/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hj0tcn/tifu_by_realizing_what_christians_muslims/,self.tifu,0,15,,text,False,False,False,"Hello! So as a kid (and I promise this setup matters), I was raised in an Islamic household. Thing with being Islamic in America is there aren't any good Muslim schools to send your child so they could learn both Faith and have a decent education. So my parents decided to send me to a Catholic school since it was closest to the values they wanted me to live by. At home, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Quoran. I loved those stories, but sometimes, my grandmother would stop her storytelling voice and use her fact voice. Like she was telling me something that happened at the store. She was using her fact voice when she was telling me about the story of how a father had to sacrifice his son to God but when he tried to bring down the knife, it wouldn't hurt his son because God had willed that his dedication meant he no longer needed to sacrifice his son. So I asked my grandmother if I could become invincible to knives if I believed in God enough and she told me ""No don't take the story literally. Take the meaning of the story."" Aka do not stab yourself. So I was like oooooh all of these stories are *metaphorical.* The Bible at my school and the Quoran at home are both collections of stories filled with wisdom meant to be interpreted as the situation sees fit. Like a superhero story where Jesus and Muhammad are the main characters. They're meant to help the story deliver me a meaning like Ash from Pokemon. I think you see where this is going, I thought they were stories. *They're not real*. And I grew up thinking that. That these religions were a way of life, not to be taken literally.

Cut to driving with a friend from school through California to Palm Springs to see her grandmother. We were talking about how hot it was and I joked about how we needed a flood to cool us down. Where's God's wrath when you need, right? She laughed and started to draw the conversation to her admiration of Jesus. We started talking about miracles and hungry people and I said ""Man, I wish we could do those kind of miracles for real. The world could use a few."" and she replied something along the lines of ""Well who knows? Jesus could be back soon"" and I chuckled. Did that thing where you blow air out of your nose and smile. I thought it was a joke. Like ha, ha Superman is gonna come fly us to her grandma's house. And she looked at me and asked me why I laughed. I told her I thought she was being sarcastic. She corrected me that she was not. Then I asked her ""wait are you saying like.. Jesus could actually, really show up on Earth""? She got upset and said yes. Then the rest of the car ride was quiet. So instead of thinking ""Jesus is real"". I thought ""wow my friend must be really gullible"".

Then once I got home, I told my grandmother about it. I thought it be a funny story. Like telling someone that your friend thinks elves are real. But she looked at me and went ""OP, Muhammad is real. And so was Jesus. What are you talking about?"" For the next 10 mins we kept talking and I started to realize that oh my god, my grandmother thinks the stories are real. Does everyone think that the stories about water turning into wine, and walking on water, and touching sick people to heal them was *REAL???*

Lastly, I pulled my pastor aside at school. And I asked him straight up ""Is Jesus real?"" and of course he was confused and said yes and asked me if I thought Jesus wasn't real. I told him what I had thought my whole life and he goes ""Yeah, everything in the Bible actually happened"". So I asked him why none of those miracles have happened now or at all recorded in history and he goes ""I don't know, but the Lord does and we trust him"".

So now my friend doesn't talk to me, school is weird now because all of these ridiculous, crazy stories about talking snakes, angels visiting people, and being BROUGHT. BACK. FROM. THE. DEAD. are all supposed to be taken literally. And asking questions about it isn't ok either, apparently. So yep. That's eye opening.

TLDR: I thought the Bible and Quoran were metaphorical books and that everything in them wasn't real but rather just anecdotal wisdom. Then I learned people actually thought things in the Bible and Quoran were real. Now everything is tense between me and my friends and family.

Edit: So many comments! Wanted to say thank you for every respectful, well thought out theological opinion or suggestion. I can't say thank you enough to everyone in the comments and all your different experiences with religion and spirituality are inspiration and ideas I will consider for a while. Even if I can't reply to you in time, thank you. Genuinely, thank you."

The rumor was that grandma had an affair with a man named ""Tillery"" when she got pregnant with my father. My grandparents always denied it, but the rumors have always hung around my dad. Grandpa was a Native American man grandma was white, and dad was their only biological child (his siblings were adopted). My dad was blonde as a kid but got darker as he's aged, and he looks like grandpa, so because we all believed 100% that he was biologically grandpa's son, we decided to finally set his fears aside and prove it with a DNA kit for his 61st birthday. The kit came back today after nervously waiting several weeks, and there's a lot of matched relatives, with the name ""Tillery"". No native American DNA results at all, no one with his fathers family's name. He's crushed and I feel awful. This has to be the worst thing I've ever done to my dad.

Tldr: I bought my dad a DNA kit to prove he wasn't the result of an affair, and instead proved he was.

Update: We talked about the whole thing, and he's okay with the results. He was disappointed and needed to come to grips with it. He appriciates his dad even more now, and thinks he must have known all along. He is glad to have the information for health reasons, and to be able to look into some history in a way he couldn't before."

I squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

Though I couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.

I noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, ""Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

Her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled ""Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!"" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

A few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

Hang in there little buddy! One weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies! 

&#x200B;

TL;DR- Sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. Asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend."

Don’t be an asshole when the person some stranger voted for is none of your business. I don’t go around asking if random people voted for either, then throw a fit about it. People come from all walks of life, culture, creed, and political association. It’s none of my damn business what some person I’ll probably never meet again does with their vote. I have too much going on in my own life to worry about that, and I’m sure many of you do as well. 

Edit #2: Clerks have cameras. Forwarded with time stamps of my call during the time of this happening to ACLU and police. I don’t care if you believe this or not, just be safe and don’t be an asshole to those around you for stupid reasons like this. 


I was not even at the Clerk’s office to vote, as I did so by mail awhile back. I went there to renew my auto registration, and bailed as soon as I saw the line descending into the staircase. Upon leaving, this guy pulls up in his giant white truck and asks if I voted for Trump. I say “fuck no, not here for that.” Bad move, i guess. He proceeds to drive next to me, screaming that I must “live in my mommy’s basement”, that he’s going to “get me”, “You’re a f*cking r*t*rd”, etc. while following me to my car and trying to cut me off (I’m walking down the road to get to the sidewalk that leads to the side parking area at this point. He waits for me to get into my car, and then several vehicles start following me until I pull up to the police station. I have a pretty recognizable car, so I put up the security/motion cameras that I bought months ago tonight just to be safe once this all blows over.

The world/country we (I) live in is sickening. Tell people it’s not their business or ignore them if they ask. It’s hard to trust this insanity.

TL;DR :Told Trump supporter I didn’t vote for Trump, witnessed voter harassment for the first time."

I am bisexual and thought she was really cute, but never once thought that she could possibly be into girls as well, least of all me.

My self esteem was extremely low around that age and I did all kinds of mental gymnastics to explain away all of her flirting. I once saw her at the grocery store and she became really shy and didn't approach me (she was very shy in general) but later that day sent me a message saying something like ""I saw you at the grocery store today, you looked cute"". 

But the absolute boldest move I completely ignored was Valentine's day when we hung out as a group with our friends and she walked over to me and gifted me a hint so broad, I can't explain how the wrapper didn't burst: She had made me handmade heart-shaped chocolates and put them in a small transparent gift bag. There was only one other thing in the gift bag, the only thing in the universe that could be gayer than heart-shaped chocolate from one gal to another: a little paper card with some kind words on it and printed on the other side was a picture (a manga panel from the looks of it) of two girls holding hands.

And my only thought was: ""Wow, what a nice girl! I have to be really careful not to develop a huge crush on her, since she couldn't possibly be into me! She probably felt bad for me on Valentine's day because I'm so single and unfortunate-looking. Those straight girls really lead you on without meaning to!""

Today I looked back on this situation with horrified realization, as Facebook told me she got married recently. To a woman.

TL;DR: I thought a teenage friend had just been REALLY nice to me, realized she had been gay the whole time when she got married."

I posted on Reddit [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/9pptze/my_roommate_saw_someone_throw_this_kitten_out_of/) with a picture of the cat saying ""My roommate saw someone throw this kitten out of a window on the highway. Picked her up and went to the vet. She has a paralyzed leg and a concussion. She's getting lots of love now"".

This post ends up getting some traction on Reddit and some upvotes. Taylor, the girlfriend, has a history of being batshit crazy. Screaming and slamming doors during fights and just an overall crazy girlfriend. She is on Reddit herself and sees the post on [r/Cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cats/). She comes to MY house and starts slamming doors and screaming at me threatening to beat me up because I did not mention her in the post! All I said is my roommate found the cat, not my roommate and his girlfriend.

She got so butthurt that I didn't mention her in a completely anonymous post for fake internet points. I honestly thought she was going to beat me up over this. Tony had to calm her down and I was half scared half laughing. She is much much bigger than me and actually works out. So if she did throw a punch I would be down for the count. I've never been in a fight or even close to being in a fight until this day. Probably because I am a sane and nice person and people just don't want to hit me. 

She ended up taking the cat completely and never allowed me or my ex to see or hear updates on the cat. For fear I would gain more fake internet points...from strangers....on an anonymous site. And from that day on I am considered the toxic one.

Anyway, be careful what you post on Reddit. You never know what crazy person you will offend.

If you're reading this Taylor FU. Hope I get more fake internet points because of you.

I was on my first date with a lovely girl name Michelle.  I took her to what people my age consider a pretty nice restaurant for a date.  She didn't know where we were going ahead of time.  A few minutes after we ordered, her face turned bright red and she told me to hide.  I was confused and about to ask why when an older couple approached our table and introduced themselves as Michelle's parents.  

After some brief, uncomfortable small-talk, her father, who had already casually mentioned twice that he was a police officer, each time placing his hand where his gun holster would be, asked me a question I didn't know people still asked.

""What are your intentions with my daughter?""

For the record, my intentions were simply to get to know her and maybe start a relationship with her.  Unfortunately, the question caught me off-guard and I tend to (read: unfailingly) use humor as a defense mechanism.  So I replied:

""I don't know, officer.  I have Intention Deficit Disorder.""

Michelle and her mother both burst into laughter, but her father was not amused. He dragged my date away, never to be heard from (by me) again.

Tl;dr: date's parents happen to be at the restaurant.  Father asks ""what are your intentions with my daughter?""  I tell him I don't know due to my ""Intention Deficit Disorder"".  He didn't like it and dragged my date away."

I can't remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about ""The Donkey Show."" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. I wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading.

Someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, ""What the hell, I've never seen this sort of thing before."" So I clicked.

As weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in.

I finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

She was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, ""What the hell is this?"" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.

After about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I'm pretty sure I'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...

She said to me one day, ""I know you won't leave me for another woman, but I'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

I doubt she will ever let this one go...

TL;DR I went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

Edit: Damn! I fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, You guys are awesome! I'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

Edit2: Just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while I was pleading my case, we kept it very G rated.

Edit3: Removed the race of the man in the description so people stop getting triggered."
jbfp84,"TIFU by ordering not one, but three adult items, getting next-day delivery without realizing, and then silently watching as my dad placed them next to me.",48036,0.85,2289,2020-10-15 08:38:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jbfp84/tifu_by_ordering_not_one_but_three_adult_items/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jbfp84/tifu_by_ordering_not_one_but_three_adult_items/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"I'm never living this down. It's pretty standard for a lot of other sex-related posts here, but it's really destroyed me on an emotional and spiritual level. Obligatory 'this wasn't actually today but last week and I've just been thinking about it every day since'.

The first thing you should know is that I am NOT a sexual person. I barely ever have 'urges', I rarely think about anything like that, my libido is comparable to that of a fence posts'...etc. However, I started noticing that I was becoming increasingly bitter towards things like that, so I decided, 'You know what, I'm going to try and explore that side of me, maybe bring it out a little more!' and so, I did... it. I bought two sex toys (nothing extravagant, just basic, cheap little items) and a bottle of lubricant because I work smart, not hard.

Things SHOULD be fine, I think to myself, I'll order them and they'll come in in a week or so, no one's expecting any packages then, so there will be no issues and they'll hand it right off to me, none the wiser!

And then that DIDN'T happen, can you believe it?

No, what actually happened was worse, and proved to me that my dad is a monstrous, monstrous man who lives to cause me pain. Unbeknownst to me, I was still under my trial of Amazon Prime (I'd forgotten to cancel it after buying a Vulpix plush, sue me), and the package shipped and arrived... The next day. Even this should have been fine, no one in my family opens packages that aren't theirs except one little thing: MY package came in with my MOMS' packages.

I didn't realize they were coming in that day, so I was still curled up in bed watching TV. When I heard the delivery truck pull up, I thought, 'oh cool' and then went back to my show. It just so happened that my mom ordered a lot of different parts for her car, and then she assumed the box was one of hers as well without checking the label since I hadn't mentioned ordering anything to her (obviously).

According to my mom, she opened it, thought, 'oh, \*my dad\* must have bought something.' and then... she checked the label. And saw my name.

Did she do the respectable thing and tape it back up with clear tape like nothing happened? Did she just hand it to me and walk away silently? No, she went to my dad. Because of course she did. According to my mom, she walked in, said, 'our daughter ordered sex toys and I don't know how to handle it' and my dad shot up in bed with horror. A moment later, he giggled and jumped out of bed, taking the box from her and saying, 'I want to give it to her!'

He walks into my room. I say hey to him and sit up to look at him. He tilts the box towards me to show it's contents, and then we stare at each other in silence for several seconds before he sets it down next to me with the biggest grin on his face, and then calmly walks off.

I can't look my parents in the face anymore. I might actually have to move out, COVID be damned because my dad won't stop making masturbation jokes.

TL;DRI ordered two sex toys and lube off Amazon without realizing I had Prime, which meant that I didn't grab my package when it was delivered. My mom opened it, thinking it was hers, and then went to my dad for help. My dad is a monster, so he came into my room and stared at me while showing me the contents of the box, then set it down next to me and walked out. I think I'm getting an apartment soon.

Edit: I've seen some comments about my dad being gross or weird for this, my mother is equally as weird, and a fair share of incest comments. I want to assure you all that this is pretty normal in my family dynamic, my parents are VERY sex-positive to the point it's an ongoing joke in our house. They encourage us to explore our sexualities and are just GREAT parents. My mom panicked and went to my dad, her best friend, and as horrified as my dad was, he saw the chance to tease me relentlessly and he did what any great father would do and took. That. Chance.

And to the incredibly odd incest comments: Your kink, not my kink. Also, I'm a lesbian and my dad is pretty much exclusively into hot moms, so. Ya know."

I bought a present for my grandmother from a website for her birthday. All went well. She got the present and was delighted with it. A few months later I used the same website to order a vibrator but it never arrived. I called customer support to complain and they went over my order including making sure that they had the correct address. It was then that I realized that I had sent the vibrator to my grandmother as her address had been saved as the default one from the previous order. 

I called my grandmother to ask if she had received the package. She said yes she had but she gave it to my dad because she thought it was a toy for his cats that I had sent to her house by mistake. Now I don’t know if my grandmother honestly did not know that this was a vibrator and really thought it was a cat toy. I believe she really had no idea what it was. She grew up catholic in a small southern town and wasn’t exposed to much outside of her little world. 

So now, not only had I sent a vibrator to my grandmother, she had given it to my dad. I refused to call my dad. I was not ready to have that conversation. But about a week later I got the package from my dad that contained the vibrator. We never spoke of it. 

You would think this is the end of the story but it is not. Remember when I called customer service to find out why I didn’t get my package? They were very nice and sent out a replacement. Where did they send the replacement? TO MY GRANDMOTHER!!! I never told them to change the address. At this point I was just too embarrassed to ask anyone about it and tried to forget it ever happened. 

Cut to Christmas. My dad came to visit. He told me he had something for me so I went to the guest room with him. He hands me the package with the vibrator and says “please, for the love of god, stop sending vibrators to your grandmother”.

TL;DR sent a vibrator to my grandmother who gave it to my dad to give to me TWICE!!!"

My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I’d eaten too much cheese and couldn’t be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I’ve never actually tried to play it (it’s more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it’s time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what’s happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don’t think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

TL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

For background, I usually make the bed in the mornings, but I didn't yesterday morning because I was running late.

I went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. I got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn't find her. Her wallet was there so I figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. I started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. I called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. I called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. My father in law told me to track her phone, so I went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. I turn on the find my iPhone sound and start running through the apartment thinking I should call the cops.

I hear the sound coming from our bedroom so I go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell I'm doing. Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

I had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr I didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then I thought I was about to end up in an episode of SVU."

This is gonna be descriptive and NSFW.

When I was 17, I was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. During my stay I met my new doctor, and after we exchanged a few words and all that, he told me he had to put a finger in my butt to test something. It was extremely awkward but fine. After I got out the hospital I had to continue seeing this doctor frequently for checkups and he had to perform 2 colonoscopies on me. After that my condition got better & I only need to continue seeing him now for checkups.

During the checkups over the years my family and him formed a bond. He's a cool doctor and my parents really like him and were super thankful that he nursed me back to health, so my dad offered my doctor a service that he provides for work just as a thank you. That's how both of our families eventually came together and shortly after, I started dating my doctor's oldest son (he's 23, I'm 22).

This was (and still is) completely fine. My family loves him and his family loves me, we've been together for almost 2 years now. So here's where I fucked up.

He's been staying back at his family's house since quarantine started and we missed each other so I decided to go over (I've been quarantined as well) and hang out with them. He told me to come early so we could have some alone time (both parents are Healthcare workers) so I did. We were in his room and things were getting heated and I basically just flat out told him I wanted to try anal.

He was open to it but was hesitant because of my UC. He asked me if it was safe for us to do that and without thinking, my BIG ASS MOUTH said,

""I don't know, I'd have to ask your dad. He's the only one who's been in my ass before.""

I can't explain the look on his face but it goes without saying that that completely ruined the mood. I was laughing out of embarrassment and sorrow and I really just wanted to melt into the floor and disappear. I'm sure he already knew that his dad did that stuff to me because obviously I'm his patient but I'm also sure he'd pushed that thought way into the back of his mind and I drudged it up.

Dinner with the family was kind of awkward and before I left he tried to reassure me and tell me that it wasn't as horrible as I thought and we could just forget about it but I don't know how I'll ever recover from that.

And no, before anyone asks, I'm not going to ask his dad if it's safe for me to try anal with his son.

TL;DR: I told my boyfriend that his dad (My doctor) had been in my ass before (Because of procedures) right before sex.

edit: holy shit i went to sleep and woke up and this is at 25k?? i don't really know what to say but thank yall for living through this nightmare with me i guess and thanks to the people w/ uc/chrons (AND doctors!!) who actually gave me advice on having anal LMAO

edit2 (regarding uc/chrons) : for those asking because I can't get to everyone, I had alot of other procedures done too, even a pill cam which I didnt know existed until I had it, but the one thing that finally worked for me was Mercaptopurine (6MP). I think I got lucky and it worked wonders for me and basically gets rid of all my symptoms, even though I still sometimes have those horrible stomach aches. good luck to everyone who's still struggling with it"

After a few months of dating she told me that she will come visit me at work (a secluded place where no one can see or hear us) we both knew the we're going to have sex for the first time that evening.

So i went out and bought a fresh pack of condoms.
When she came things heated up and we took of our cloths, but suddenly i stared smelling a horrible smell that turned me off completely, i didn't went to disappoint so we had sex anyway but i definitely did not enjoy it.

In the following days i thought that i will never enjoy having sex with her again, and so i broke up with her (i was young and stupid i know)

Three years later, last week, i had used the same brand of condoms and stared smelling EXACTLY the same smell, and realized that the beautiful girl i used to date wasn't stinky - the condoms were.

I feel like I've made the stupidest mistake of my life.


TL:DR i broke up with a a beautiful girl because i thought she was stinky during sex.
It turns out, the condoms we used were stinky not the girl.

Edit: wow im getting alot of hate from people, most of it is deserved - what i did was not ok.
But please keep in mind that i was 19 and stupid i didn't analyze this too much i just had a bad experience and jumped to conclusions.

Just to add a few missing details in the post 
1. I broke up with her respectfully, i didn't tell her it was due to the smell
2. The brand off condoms we used is durax (a few people messaged me with the exact same problem. So i guess there are people who are more sensitive to the smell of durax products)
3. Alot of people suggest contacting her and apologize - i agree, i doubt we will be a couple again but she deserves to know why i broke up with her."

I was 25 heading to a 21st for a girl from uni at her house (she was living with her parents). It was far from my house and i knew the street, so i just left home and when i got to the street i realised i didnt know the number and didnt have the invite. I messaged another friend to find out the address, but he didnt have it either.

There were only about 40 houses in the court, and it was pretty quiet, so i figured id just have a stroll and listen for music and a busy house. 

Stroll up to the only house with any sound music going, 25 year old bloke, bottle of happy birthday vodka in hand and knock on the door. 'Hi, im iamnotjacksnipples, im a friend of Stephs here for the birthday'.

Mum looks at me a bit confused but pleasantly welcomes me in, and walks me through the house, past a group of roughly 15 year old, family eying me uncertainly. I start thinking maybe thats just the younger cousins and the main party is out back. Takes me further through the house to her other daughters room, who coincidentally is named Steph. 'Steph, your friend is here...' as i round the corner into the doorway i look at this 17-18year old and my face drops, 'i... dont know you' i say awkwardly, then look at the mum desperately hoping i have not just become the biggest creep on the planet bringing vodka to a 15th birthday as a bloke in his mid 20's.

Very fortunately i explained who i was and who i was looking for, and the lovely mum walked me down the street to the house i was meant to be at as she knew the family. I apologised profusely again, and thanked her for her help and understanding.

Tl;dr. i brought vodka to a 15 year old girls party that i wasnt invited to as a 25 year old man by mistake, but mother was really understanding and helped me get where i was meant to be."

This particular one is from Tinder.

I'd been chatting with this guy a few days, and everything was going swimmingly. We had so much in common and were looking for the same things. His pictures were cute, and he didn't live too far away. All seemed well.

I invited him over to grill out some burgers in my backyard. He asked if he could bring anything - I said sure bring some bacon for the burgers! He agreed and said he'd be over soon.

Given his distance, I expected him to be over in \~15 minutes. I started the grill and seasoned the burgs. Half an hour later He messaged me, ""I've driven by a couple times and chickened out. Are you sure you want me to come over?"" Maybe a red flag, but I chalked it up to nerves and just said come on I'm hungry.

So this Hagrid lookin guy shows up, much different than his Cedric picture. That's alright, I can move past that. From the minute he walked up, and I kid you not, he did NOT take a breath. Within the first five minutes I knew his life story from his aunt who hated their grandma to his father who likes to collect taxidermy. Not a single breath.

Again I figured he was just nervous. I put the burgers on, and when they're ready he pulls out a ziploc from his POCKET with two pieces of bacon in it. He puts them only on his burger. Okay...

We sit down at the patio table to start eating (I finished my burger before he even started his - he did NOT stop talking the entire time). When we sit down, he reaches into his pocked out pulls out... a vial? It is about 2 inches tall with a cork in it. It's filled with black powder. He must have noticed me staring at it flipping between if he was about to snort something strange or build some sand-art. He said, ""Oh,"" all super casual. ""I'd like to INTRODUCE YOU TO MY MOTHER.""

I just stared at him for what felt like an eternity. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry or run. ""I like to bring her to any important event in my life. She also has ashes in this necklace I'm wearing, and in this ring I have on, and this half-sleeve tattoo is for her.""

Now, mind you, I've lost too many people close to me, and I do not judge people based on their grief cycles, we all cope differently and I respect that. But homeboy brought a VIAL of his mother's ashes, and set them on the table for our FIRST date. I simply could not.

He finally finished his burger and I made some excuse about having to clock in and finish some work... at 9:30pm. He texted me before he even got to his car and told me ""My mother really liked you, I can't wait to see you again.""

I told him I didn't feel the connection - to him, or his mother.

TL ; DR Tinder date brought his mother to our first date... in an unconventional way."

I just saw a comment that reminded me of what happened so here we go.

I used to play an MMO with a bunch of people I knew IRL. Out of all of them, I was the most interested in PvP but sucked at it. One day a new guy shows up. He used to play, but stopped for a few years. Everyone starts talking about how he was basically a legend, a god at 1v1s, was one of the former top players in the game, was so inhumanly good he got mistaken for a bot, etc.

I immediately developed an awkward crush on him. He heard I was into PvP and challenged me to a 1v1 where he promptly kicked my ass. Then he spent a lot of time condescendingly giving me tips on how to improve and said he would show me the ropes. Being a dork with a crush, I was so grateful for any attention he gave me.

His idea of teaching me was basically beating me over and over again. After a few days of this, he got bored and stopped paying attention to me. I was embarrassed that I was so bad and kept losing, so I though if I could impress him, he would spend time in game with me again. I spent a stupid amount of time practicing on the side and researching. I'm talking like 6 hours on weekdays and 10+ on weekends. I literally lost weight because I stopped snacking on the side and ate the minimum amount at meal times.

So after like 10 months of nonstop playing, I improved a stupid crazy amount. Managed to jokingly convince him to duel and I beat him. He thought it was a fluke and demanded a rematch. So we played again and I beat him again. He got so mad he changed his build to exactly counter mine, and he beat me. I was so happy because I thought he was into it, so I changed my build to counter his and beat him. And it turned into this stupid back and forth.

I was having the time of my life. I thought I was showing off my improvement to a guy I liked. I learned theory-crafting, I learned how to play properly, etc etc. Meanwhile he was fucking raging his head off on his side of the screen. After a lot of back and forth killing each other in turns, he finally says he's done and logs off. I had no idea what happened and figured real life things was going on.

Anyways, he didn't log back on for a while and I heard from our mutual friend that he quit the game. He claimed he only came back temporarily from a break and needed to focus on real life job stuff or something.

I did not connect that with beating him. I just thought the timing was bad and I was sad I wouldn't be able to see him around anymore. He never logged back on again. A few months later we had another IRL hangout and he basically ignored me. Then made a few pointed comments about how he didn't like girls who were as into gaming as he was. And that girls who liked games too much were basically guys and he wasn't into guys. And that's when I finally realized he was mad I beat him.

And he literally never returned to play again. And after a few more years, I quit gaming. And funnily enough, I heard from our mutual friend again that that's when he decided to start playing again.

TL;DR I got good at a game to impress a guy I liked, beat him, and turns out he didn't like girls who were into gaming and also quit the game.

Edit: Fuck I wrote this on a whim before going to sleep. To clarify, he wasn't actually that good. It's like how everyone knows that one guy who's super good at Smash, but then goes to a local tournament and gets wrecked by actual pros. He was the best out of our little circle of friends, but wasn't actually top tier in the game. And at the end of that day, I wasn't even considered close to top tier either.

Also dug up my old reddit account because I knew a bunch of people were going to call me fake. Feel free to peruse my post history to confirm my level of obsession. It's a bit sad, I definitely had an unhealthy interest/addiction. I ended up quitting cold turkey and haven't logged back on in years. Sorry to all my old teammates, I literally left them with a ""see you next time"" and vanished off the face of the planet.

Edit2: I didn't quit the game because of him. I played for several more years after and got back into PvP and shot up the ranks because I went from a keyboard turning skill-clicker into someone who could actually play. Did weekly tournaments for a bit, got good enough to see the occasional pro players in my queue and formed a little team with other people around my level. The game itself went through a ton of bad balance patches and a ton of people left. I ultimately left because the gamemode was ""dying"" and I realized it was making me depressed and more angry and toxic the more I played."
mb6y2n,TIFU by never wearing glasses during sex,47682,0.85,1799,2021-03-23 10:21:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mb6y2n/tifu_by_never_wearing_glasses_during_sex/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mb6y2n/tifu_by_never_wearing_glasses_during_sex/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"So a little backstory here I guess. My first girlfriend would always take of my glasses before we made out (she wore glasses, too, so we sounded like two lustful wineglasses otherwise). She did this every time, so eventually it just became a habit for me. Things are getting heavy? Better take off my glasses. It went that way for years, and I never really questioned it. I just assumed it was normal.

The thing is, I have pretty bad vision. I'm not legally blind by any means, but I certainly can't read any kind of text without glasses unless it's inches from my face. Everything goes blurry immediately. That's not a big deal though if you're getting it on with someone--that's 50% by feel, 50% by sound, right?

Well I recently learned otherwise. I was seeing this new girl, and she jumped me one time with a surprise sexy encounter. We were ripping our clothes off so fast that I didn't have time to take off my glasses. And I'll tell you what: it was like hitting the HD button on pornhub after you've been watching nothing but scrambled VHS tapes for your entire life. Everything snapped into focus! It was amazing! I could see everything! Nipples! Goosebumps! The sweaty wet spot on the bed!

Is this what it feels like for normal-sighted people? Is your sex life just a walking, talking porno? Do you not look down and say, ""wow, what a sexy brown blob"" but instead say ""wow, NVidia did a great job this year!""? This is absolutely life-changing, and I need anyone who reads this and wears glasses to take a long hard look at themselves, and then do it again but this time while wearing your glasses. Hopefully you can avoid my mistake.

TL;DR: wear glasses during sex and turn your pp into a 1080pp"
8kvias,TIFU by getting Google to ban our entire company while on the toilet,47508,0.9,1948,2018-05-21 02:29:42,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8kvias/tifu_by_getting_google_to_ban_our_entire_company/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8kvias/tifu_by_getting_google_to_ban_our_entire_company/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,False,False,"**TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

Preface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won't be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It's safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

I have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. 

As a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: ""Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

Recently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

About an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

One of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. 

The afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.

Eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

Anyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?

Yeah...

So it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

So yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out. "
j2tymi,TIFU by hatching a nest of hundreds of baby BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS in my bedroom,47441,0.9,2723,2020-10-01 01:54:46,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j2tymi/tifu_by_hatching_a_nest_of_hundreds_of_baby_black/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j2tymi/tifu_by_hatching_a_nest_of_hundreds_of_baby_black/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This did, essentially, happen today.  

A couple weeks ago my 5 year old daughter found a black widow mom and her egg sack.  She wanted to look at it, so I very carefully scooped it up into a jar, twisted on the top and went around it with duct tape for good measure.  She begged to let them hatch so she could watch them, and this seemed to be decent science homeschooling, after which point I planned to put them in the freezer for a somewhat humane death.  What’s the harm, I thought?  They are sealed up well.  

Well guess what, they weren’t.  The jar I used was plastic and something some toys had come in.  There were small HOLES in the bottom and sides, barely visible.  Smaller than a hole punch, but plenty big for a baby black widow.

So today we’re going about our lives, when she notices a tiny spider.  I kill it.   Then there’s another.  Then another.  I start to think....oh no.  I grab the jar to find the egg sack has indeed hatched, with hundreds of tiny little venom weapons.  But I see with the relief the duct tape is still there, there’s no way they could have gotten out.  Til I look at my hand.  IN THE MOMENT I WAS HOLDING THE JAR ONE CRAWLED ON TO MY HAND.  At which point I noticed the holes.  I screamed, said some words that definitely shouldn’t be said in front of a 5 year old, and wanted to fling away the jar but managed to hold on to it in fear that tossing it would further distribute its murderous contents.  


Now my child is playing outside while I furiously vacuum and clean and wash every surface.
  G-d have mercy.

TL;DR Thought I was showing my child some cool nature in action, ended up with nature all over my bedroom, where nature means hundreds of baby black widows.

Edit:  here are pictures of the ones that didn’t escape https://imgur.com/gallery/sF1PERS

And my daughter’s rendition of them:  https://imgur.com/gallery/2fJCmq3

Further edits:

Thank you so much to the kind people who Venmoed me money for the exterminator who am I now definitely going to get to come tomorrow!  (I’m actually going to return the funds because I was able to get it worked out, but thank you SO much!)

People asking how I could be that stupid...I dunno, frazzled homeschooling single mom corona exhaustion and just poor judgment, I guess?  We’ve raised lots of other insects in jars with no escapees, so I guess I got a little overconfident about the status of jar impenetrability.  Yep.  I FUed.


Even Further edit: 

While most people are upset that I didn’t immediately KILL IT WITH FIRE and I stupidly brought it inside, enough people are upset about my inhumane treatment of the spiders that I wanted to comment on it.  They were originally on the porch, not far out in nature, and given how dangerous they were, I felt I was making a choice between killing them then and there or later.  I don’t normally have the ability to drop what I’m doing in a day a drive out to the middle of no where, far away from other humans, to release dangerous spiders.  The observation option, if I had done it correctly, seemed like it would at least offer the opportunity to see them hatch, which does make a pretty educational impact on young kids, I think, more than another YouTube video.  I do not torture animals for fun, I’m a vegetarian and hold that life is sacred.  Besides mosquitos and dangerous insects I don’t kill things.   I get why compassionate people were upset by this.  

The spiders are still alive, not frozen, and now, since she’s Reddit internet famous, today I WILL drive to the middle of nowhere and release the mom spider to go about her spider life far away from people.  If anyone wants to suggest a name for her, go for it, and she will live in hated/beloved infamy.

In the true spirit of the internet, I’m sure this will manage to displease everyone, the people who are upset I did this in the first place and will exterminate the inside ones now, and the substantial number of people who want me to KILL IT WITH FIRE  and will think it’s crazy to release the mom ;-). Sorry bout that!  I’ll post a picture of the release later, if I get a chance, and everyone can sleep with their preference of more soundly / less soundly for knowing she survived."

At the end of the semester, my students have to present a slideshow proposing a change they think would make the world better.

One of my students, Steven\*, asked if he could make his slideshow about safe-sex education being made mandatory in all public high schools.

Me, not even sure if I was ALLOWED to approve a topic in favor of rampant and unchecked fornication among the youths of America, eventually told him to go for it, warning him that he'd have to be very careful about what he put in his slideshow, considering his topic.

The day of Steven's presentation arrives. He marches to the front, and begins his slideshow, entitled ""The Case for Contraceptives.""

It's fuckin great. He tells a story about bees, who, if they want to get some sweet, sweet nectar from flowers without spreading any of their ""pollen"" around, need to learn to wear little ""booties"" on their ""feet.""

I laughed through the whole thing and then turned to the class to discuss the presentation's effectiveness. But several students had blank expressions.

Finally, one of the students, Goober\* (this student and his nickname is pure gold, but that's another story), raised his hand and said, ""Miz Holt\*, whut's a...cont-ruh-ceptive?""

I started to smile but stopped as I realized he was serious. I paused and and remembered my life before college, shuttled in a bubble between homeschooling and church and youth group.

We had a brief discussion about contraceptives then and there.

The next day, my classroom behavior under review, I was warned I was under unofficial probation (everyone at this university signs up as an ""at-will employee,"" meaning we can be fired at any time for any reason).

\*Names changed to protect the guilty

TL;DR - I nearly lose my job at a conservative Christian university after explaining what contraceptives are to a few of my confused students.

**Edit:** Many people are asking why I choose to work at such an institution. I'll ask myself the same question until I graduate and leave. But in the meantime, I love my students, and I'll keep trying to crack open their brains like my homeschooled Christian brain was cracked open when I first went to college.

Also, several people have messaged me asking me if I go to their school, and they've named SO MANY different schools. Ugh. This is America."
ja1fa1,TIFU by using the nuclear option in a game of monopoly.,47269,0.91,2782,2020-10-13 04:19:42,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ja1fa1/tifu_by_using_the_nuclear_option_in_a_game_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ja1fa1/tifu_by_using_the_nuclear_option_in_a_game_of/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"It was a four player family game of Monopoly. My brother, our parents and I were playing, and I wasn't doing well. I wasn't bankrupt or heavily mortgaged yet, but I could tell that if something drastic didn't change in the next 3 turns or so, I was toast. I didn't have any monopolies, but I did have a couple 2 out of 3 properties (New York and St. James being the standouts) and a couple scattered here or there. My brother was the clear favorite at this point, with my Dad in clear second. My Mom was losing right along with me.


It was my turn, and I was trying to arrange a favorable trade.


I'm negotiating with my Dad. I have a property that'll give him another monopoly, he has a card that'll give me a monopoly. We both have enough money and side properties to even things up afterward. With a good trade here, we'd both have a higher chance of winning, significantly cutting into on my brother's lead. Seems like it should be a slam dunk, right?


But no, my Dad is pushing for the most ridiculous trades possible, and outright refusing to trade away those properties that are most valuable to me. If I don't get a monopoly out of this, I might as well not even bother with a trade.


I'm getting frustrated as the negotiating stalls. But I get an idea. A terrible, terrible idea.


I say to my Dad: ""Dad, I'm clearly in the weaker position, here. But right now, that just means I have less to lose. So here's the deal. If I don't get a trade from you that gives me a monopoly, I'm going to sell all of my properties to [brother's name] for $1.""


Dad didn't like that at all, and there was no trade. He also probably didn't expect me to carry through, but immediately after, I sold all my deeds to my brother for a dollar, and my Dad lost any chance whatsoever of winning the game.


Dad isn't speaking to me right now.


Was that a supremely dickish move to play? Yup. I'm feeling a little vindicated, though, for not letting myself be pushed around when I was the little guy.


But will anyone ever want to play Monopoly with me again? I kinda doubt it.


TL;DR was losing at family Monopoly, went MAD and made Dad mad, family board games won't ever be the same.

My parents are still into each other, and I’m grateful. Although I’d pass on seeing the ass pats and octopus entanglements I’ve witnessed. My parents have been taking “full advantage” of the quality/quantity time, blasting music on the reg as if we can’t do the mental calculus about what’s going on behind closed doors.

Last night, I was cooking with mom as we listened to one of my playlists that we share on Spotify as she was telling me how sorry she was that my college life is on hold. We’ve had the mother-daughter talk about sex but mostly abide the “don’t ask don’t tell” policy. As she was blathering on about how special our lock-down time is, I jokingly told her that my siblings and I all know how much she and my dad are enjoying quarantine. She blushed, laughed it off, and I thought that was the end…until this morning when I wake up, perplexed and confused, as she detonates my own MY PLAYLIST against me, played at decibel level to blister ears.

She’s the type to double down on a bad joke, so before she could completely ruin songs for me,I quickly replaced them with the worst kid's music I could find. I laughed my ass off when the super-annoying and cringingly appropriate “Bouncy Ball"" from Dora the Explorer echoed through my house.

My victory was short-lived because I’ve spent the last two hours trying to take a college final while Barry White and Marvin Gaye serenade me through the drywall.

TL:DR Teased my mom about having sex. Now, getting clowned as she gets the last laugh.

EDIT: Her reign of terror continues. She's changed all of the names to my playlists. Some of them include: ""Sexify my soul"", ""Your dad has big feet"" and ""Too hard to get out of bed""... God, help me.

EDIT2: You people are amazing. Thanks for making my day! My BF is on the way over for dinner and who knows what shit is about to go down with my bad ass mom when he gets here. Be safe eveeyone and keep on laughing."

I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. “Beth” comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. 

I am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  

We get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says “Oh. My goodness, what happened?”  So I respond as a joke “Eh, she got out of line”.   

I know!  It’s horrible. I’m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I’m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

He comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor’s office to talk.  

There is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth’s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

The police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

The police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

We get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  

The county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week.  I can’t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I’m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  

Edit: Spelling

Edit 2:  Update
Thank you for the gold kind strangers.
Wow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.

2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.

3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  It turned out to be nothing."

Not because it’s my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as “a Christmas gift” to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn’t think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

Anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it’s working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say “more” and “all done” and “drink”! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

Well today with my husband out of town, I didn’t feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn’t hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs “drink”. And every time she wants my attention, she signs “dad” because apparently the slightly different sign for “mom” isn’t as fun for her. Ok, whatever. 

Well I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they’re looking over at us and snickering. I’m like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It’s fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of “she’s calling you ‘dumb’ and telling you she wants to drink alcohol”. 

I’m like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for “drink (non-alcoholic beverage)” and “drink alcohol” and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would’ve done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

TL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

ETA: Thanks, everyone! I’m glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

Also please note that I literally searched “baby sign language” and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all. I’m new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen “today”. You can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)"

I got a phone call last night saying that I didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

We decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.

The bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

Because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

While he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

I now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell."
s63xiy,TIFU by telling a woman at our first date that her pepper spray is useless.,46941,0.91,2521,2022-01-17 18:52:30,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/s63xiy/tifu_by_telling_a_woman_at_our_first_date_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/s63xiy/tifu_by_telling_a_woman_at_our_first_date_that/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,,False,"So this actually happened today. A few hours ago.

So a friend set me up with this woman because she thought we have similar hobbies and a similar dark humor. We met today the first time for a coffee/tea. We were actually having a good time, or at least I thought so. We clicked right away and had a lot to talk and laugh about.

After like an hour she suggested to pay our drinks and go somewhere else for launch and I happily agreed. As we were about to pay our drinks she started searching her purse for her wallet and put various objects on the counter because she seemed like to have a bit of a mess in her purse. One of these objects was a pepper spray. I casually mentioned after leaving the coffee ""Id consider getting a different pepper spray if you plan to defend yourself. This one is quite useless.""

*For a bit of context: I used to test various of pepper sprays and tear gas in the military. We were stupid and young but it was also kind of thrilling. And the product she had was by far the worst/weakest we tested. I just recognized the bottle because it was so bad and thought I should let her know that this is probably not the best option to go with. But she obviously didnt know about that because, well, we just met an hour ago.*

After this comment our conversation kind of died and she suddenly had a work emergency and had to go. I took me a few minutes until I realized that my comment was beyond creepy without any context. I am definitely not used to meet new people. I hope Ive not traumatized her.

TLDR: Creeped out a woman Ive only met an hour before by telling her her pepper spray would be not very effective if she intended to defend herself.

&#x200B;

Edit: Its all good. She called me, she apologized for running off, I apologized for my weird comment and we are going out again. Yey. Ill try to not do any weird comments about her precautions again.

Edit2: Thanks for blowing this up. She found the post and now we are sending each other screenshots of weird/funny comments. Thanks for the entertainment.

Edit3: I am not an expert for defense spray. We were just some bored soldiers with some examples. And this one was outstanding mild/bad, that is why I have recognized it. So dont ask me for pepper spray advice."

One morning I had awoken to tent having being pitched under my sheets... just like every other morning. And just like every other morning I had to.... *handle* it. I open up Pornhub on my shiny new Galaxy S4 I had recently been given for my birthday. I gave the chicken a good choking and spilled my baby batter all over my chest. Yada. Yada. Yada.

A few minutes later I get text from my sister to the effect of ""WHAT THE FUCK!!!!"". Then I get a call from my mom. She's livid. She's screaming at me asking me ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?? WHY DID YOU SEND ME THAT!"". She hangs up before I can ask what she's talking about. Then I get a call from my dad with him yelling the same thing. I tell him mom had yelled at me too but I don't know what she or he is talking about. He says I sent a help message with a picture of myself in bed with my shlong and ejaculate in view. That was when I realized what had happened.

I had turned on a setting on the S4 which sends an emergency message to my ""In Case of Emergency"" contacts if you press the power button three times. When it's activated, it sends a message, a picture and an audio recording (yeah, there was even audio). I had apparently squeezed the S4's power button a few times as I was getting close to finishing.

TLDR : I accidentally sent my family a picture and audio of myself mid-orgasm."
ddxnub,TIFU by watching my neighbours fight while I was eating popcorn.,46752,0.92,996,2019-10-06 08:29:00,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ddxnub/tifu_by_watching_my_neighbours_fight_while_i_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ddxnub/tifu_by_watching_my_neighbours_fight_while_i_was/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"So I'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally I was watching the match on my living room little did I know there was another match going on my neighbours house. About ten minutes into my game, I started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

Between the game and the distance between us I really couldn't distinguish any words, so I just raised the volume of my TV and kept watching. During half time I got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so I lower the volume of the TV as I microwave some popcorn.

By this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as I take the popcorns out of the microwave I hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so I went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case I had to call the cops of something. Now I have two dogs so I didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so I brought it with me.

So here I am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. For the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. By now I could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so I thought. Suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as I gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

Now try to see this from their perspective. They've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. This got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""ENJOYING THE SHOW YOU \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

I honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. They both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""Can YOU BELIEVE this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

When I got inside I was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

Edit: I know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments I've gotten.  You all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! Also shut out to all the Cruz Azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game I was watching!

Edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a TIFU and it probably isn't a dramatic one I'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

TL;DR My neighbours were having a big fight while I was watching a soccer game, I went out to check while she slapped her husband as I was holding a big bag of popcorn. My nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again."
cxeph0,TIFU As a Reaction to Butt Worms (almost certainly NSFW),46699,0.88,1418,2019-08-30 15:19:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cxeph0/tifu_as_a_reaction_to_butt_worms_almost_certainly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cxeph0/tifu_as_a_reaction_to_butt_worms_almost_certainly/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"This is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

Also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

For background: At some point in my childhood, I developed pin-worms. In the interest of science, I must admit that I don't know for certain that I had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that I had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

I'm afraid that I don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all I remember is that as a young child I walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and I don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

Fast forward a decade and a half: I am living on my own. Single. Re-Acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone I am still close to refers to as ""She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". I don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....I had worms. My butt was beyond-normally itchy. Sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. The confirmation came when I showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

I hoped they would go away. I showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. But every morning, I would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

I was horrified, but I made an appointment at my local clinic. When I told the nurse over the phone that I thought I had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. She said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

I went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in Sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly South-East Indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

I was already frustrated, but I waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. Later I drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before I would get results.

In the meantime, I remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

I would like to say that as a liberal American male, I wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that I did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, I dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what I had done.

Now to add: I had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. We had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; I wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and I found ourselves showering. My hand drifted down to my butt-crack and I realized I \*NEEDED\* to share my story with her, despite fears that I would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. So I spurted it out: ""Uhm, so yeah, I...uh...think I have butt worms....""

She was so practical about it. She asked to see. I pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""See,"" I said, embarrassed. ""Worms.""

...

""That's toilet paper"", she replied.

""W...what?""

""Yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""That's toilet paper.""

Everything fell into place. About a month ago, when finances got tight, I swapped my normal TP roll with Dollar Store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after I wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

My relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . My shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

TLDR: I spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because I bought cheap toilet paper.

Postscript: Shower companion and I just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary."

She told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

I followed up by saying, ""But sometimes, people can see my butt.""

She started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

So I had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; I wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

I then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to [http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/](http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and I was shocked.

We were both curious where/how I even learned that from.

Was it a potty training error? Apparently not. We asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

So, I've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

TL;DR

For 20 years, I squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt."

Part of the job involves putting in placeholder text and links since I'll be told ""We need a link to this resource but it's not available"".

There's an unspoken agreement that if I'm not given an actual link, I will link to random things; sometimes it's a viral video, sometimes it's an anime meme, and sometimes it's music videos to what I'm listening to. This is just for the draft so it doesn't matter and usually just gives me something fun to add on. For the past few months, I've been working on a large campaign of flyers to promote a program to my neighboring area of half a million people and at the time. At the time, I was listneing to a lot of 80s new wave and decided to see if anyone is actually testing that the QR codes and shorteners work that I directed everything to go to Rick Astley; figured if anyoned checked it, I'd get an email commenting on it.

Time goes by, the official links are the last to be given to me so I add them in, send everything to my supervisor to approve before going to the printer to have 5,000 copies printed of each variation. My work with the project is done and now it's up to others to start putting them while I move on to the next project; that was two weeks ago. This morning, I get pulled into a zoom meeting with the other department heads and their bosses. They ask me about the link and I tell them I checked the QR code and shortener before sending it for review and if there's a error to look at the printer. I even pull up the finalized versions and verified it works. They get more serious and say that the printer wouldn't replace the links with a music video, thinking I screwed up or just did it on purpose. Turns out that the posters and fliers had been put around the county in local businesses, bus stops, out lobbies, etc and emails started to come in. I'm more surprised that anyone actually used the QR codes or links to begin with.

After getting grilled, thinking I was going to get fired, I forwarded the email I sent to my supervisor with the final versions of the graphics and they went to the correct links. The best we can figure out is that since there had been dozens of versions over a few months that someone along the chain of command mixed up an earlier version that included the Rickroll link when placing the order; no one wants to take blame for it.  We're currently in the proces of retrieving everything and debating on having stickers printed out to cover the links or pay to have everything reprinted. Even though it wasn't my fault, I'm now suppose to use dummy links and QR codes that go to an image of a tree; my time of adding random music videos has been halted.

TL;DR: TIFU by an early version of a multi-city promotional fliers got sent to the printers that contained  draft links to ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" by Rick Astley instead of the correct version and was only discovered after they had already been put up across the area.

I’m on vacation with my wife and her family and we arrived at the hotel today, checked in and settled into our rooms. A while later a few of us headed out to explore- I went and met up with a friend who lived in the area and ended up having a few drinks.

Earlier while I was out, I had got a text from my wife saying that she was switching our room with her parents’ as ours had a balcony while theirs didn’t, which her dad wanted so he could smoke (and that she was going out for dinner with her mom). Anyway I saw it, said ok fine, agreed to switch keycards with him once I got back. 

A few hours later, I was a bit drunk and my friend dropped me back to the hotel. The text had completely slipped my mind and so I headed to the room with the balcony where her parents were staying and, thinking it was ours, went right in.

As I went in, I heard the shower running in the bathroom and, feeling promiscuous, I decided to give who I thought was a my wife in the shower and little surprise. So I stripped down (completely naked) and, seeing that the door was slightly ajar, decided to barge in. So I did. While also announcing quite loudly, “Daddy’s home!”. 

The sight that lay before me is one that’ll be stuck in my mind forever- my father-in-law, naked in the shower, looking at in a mixture of disbelief, confusion and- mostly- anger.

I froze, and for a second we just stood there in silence, which was soon broken by him shouting- “What the FUCK (my name)”. 

At this point my flight response kicked in and, as fast as I could, rushed out, dressed faster than I ever have before in my life, and ran out the room. 

Since I don’t have the keycard for the other room and sure as hell am not going back to ask for it, I’m now sitting at this cafe outside the hotel. I’m waiting for my wife to get back from her dinner as I don’t really think I can explain what just happened over the phone, if I can explain it without dying of embarrassment at all. So yeah, the family brunch tomorrow should be interesting...

TL;DR: Switched hotel rooms with wife’s parents, got drunk, accidentally went into their room, barged into bathroom while FIL was showering

UPDATE: My FIL told my MIL and my wife, and both of them pretty much died of laughter. He also isn’t too upset, just told my wife to tell me I know “who daddy is around here”, who promptly relayed this message to me. Currently with the wife in OUR room, trying to get the aforementioned image out of my mind and avoided the in-laws at all costs. Also would like to clarify I did NOT know what promiscuous actually means, I swear..."
gt2p0p,TIFU by shaving my butt and joining my friend group's best butt competition while being a guy,46551,0.87,1344,2020-05-30 03:55:30,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gt2p0p/tifu_by_shaving_my_butt_and_joining_my_friend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gt2p0p/tifu_by_shaving_my_butt_and_joining_my_friend/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"So first of all, I'm an 19 year old guy and everyone involved in the butt competition was between the ages of 18 and 20. Alt-account as I don't want my friends to know my actual reddit account. TL;DR at the end.

&#x200B;

So  it al started around a week ago when some girls in my friend group came together and started drinking. They started boasting about their butt and next thing you know they wanted to do a best butt competition. I wasn't there so I don't know details but we were send a message in a group chat. Rules were simple, if you wanted to join you just had to send a pic of your butt to this certain girl who would present them anonymously to  8 guys and they would all vote for the picture of the best butt.

&#x200B;

Well, I thought it would be funny to join, but I knew that they wouldn't take it seriously because my ass is naturally extremely hairy. So I did the most logical thing at the time. I shaved it. I took the shaving equipment I normally use for my face, switched the knifes and went ham. Well this is were the first problem came in. 

&#x200B;

The stupid person I am didn't lock the door. My mom walked in on me shaving my ass. She just awkwardly wiggled away and I turned extremely red. She didn't say anything, so I thought she would just ignore it. Well she didn't. She started googling. That evening, she asked me to come to the dinner table to talk. My father ran away so I knew it would be bad, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. 

&#x200B;

She wanted to talk about *intercourse safety in a homosexual relationship*. Keep in mind, I'm not actually gay. She was extremely well prepared. Highlights of that evening were practicing with a condom and a cucumber, the dangers of gay sex without lube, and a brief summary of objects I should definitely not put in my butt (such as lamps and beer bottles). She would not listen to any of my denying and would just say: ""its okay, Your dad and I still love you"".

&#x200B;

I thought the worst was over so I send a picture of my shaven butt to the girl that was collecting them. 2 days later the 9 pictures of all the contestants were send, all without any distinguishable features, to the  8 boys. So one thing you should now is that I do have quite a good butt. I got pretty good genes in that aspect and I've been skating since I was 14. I now skate around 60km a week and skating is  an incredible way to get a firm round butt of decent size. You can probably see where this is going. I won with a total of 5 out of 8 votes. 1 picture got 2 votes and 1 got 1 vote. 

&#x200B;

The fallout from this was not that big. Some of the more prideful girls wanted to start some drama, but they didn't want to admit their butt lost to a boy, I didn't talk a lot with them anyway and Covid makes drama a little more difficult, so that was simply ignored by most of us. Our mix-gendered trip to a lake when lockdown  would end did turn a guys only trip as some of the girls suddenly didn't really feel like going and the rest didn't want to go to a lake with a such a one-sided girl/boy-ratio. I do want to say that most of the girls did think it was hilarious on some sort of level and the one that didn't are famous in our group for being extremely prideful. It is, however, extremely awkward to talk with most of them as they now look at my ass quite frequently.

&#x200B;

It doesn't stop with this by the way. I was gaming with my friends today and we started talking about the butt competition. We kept it anonymous which butt was from what person and the people that voted didn't know who won yet and I did not know who the guys that voted were. Well, the guy I was gaming with happened to be one of the people voting. He said he couldn't chose between two and so he started masturbating and voted for the one he came on. I said something along the lines of 'that's gross AF'. He than said something like 'You would understand if you saw the butt and than proceeded to send the picture he voted for via snapchat. It was mine. I didn't tell him, but I now have to live with the knowledge that a good friend of mine came on a picture of my shaven ass.

Edit: Alright, this became a lot mor popular than I thought it would be. I'm happy my awkward life is amusing random strangers on the internet.

First a little update: the guy has probably seen this post and recognized it as he just sent me a text which states 'sorry'. Nothing more. He wont answer any texts, from me or my friends. I'll try again tomorrow.

Yes, my mom is a great person. She was raised in an extremely strict catholic household. She stayed a catholic (going to church twice a week) but never wanted her kids to feel forced to be anything their not.

One thing some people seem to misunderstand is that my butt is extremely incredible to win against cheerleaders, actresses and models. My friendgroup exists out of the d&d players, the art kids, and the alternative crowd. Even though we have some incredibly beautiful people here, we were never the jaw-dropping popular crowd. Which is okay, as we always had fun.

I AM NOT A DUDE WITH A BRAZILIAN WOMAN'S ASS.

also thanks for the medals and the tips for caring after my shaven ass. I didn't think about aftercare until you guys said anything.

Also, I'm not posting pictures of my ass so that thousands of strangers can see it. Sorry, but I'm just not risking it.

Edit 2: Fine, you guys win. You know how many requests I've got for butts? Way too many. Absolutely abnormal. I don't want my bare ass to end up on the internet so I'll make one wearing something were you can see the shape of it tomorrow. God damn perverts. For now I'll go to sleep.

Edit 3: So first the updates. My friend said he is actually straight. He still a little quieter than usual, but he can see the joke. Hope it thought him not to masturbate to random people.

My mom loves you guys. I told her the whole story (minus the part about my friend cumming). She thought it was funny and said that she believed me to be bisexual for a long time and thought that me shaving was me getting ready for butt stuff. She wanted to have that talk for quite sometime.

Some people don't understand how the competition was played. The girl I send my picture to was not a contestant but more of a referee. She sent it to 8 guys that were not a part of the friend group and told them that these were of a few of her friends amd they should pick out their favourite. Later she send the results. It was a complete coincidence that my friend was a voter.

The TIFU continued by the way. My ass is itching. Like a lot. Dammit.

Lastly: You know what, I'm not going to send the pictures. Some of you guys are absolute beast. WTF. In the time that I was sleeping I got multiple messages from old man between the age of 50 and 70 talking about what they would do to my ass. I do not want them or any of the other disgusting people to have pictures of my butt. 

Add to that some people that have been spamming me for complete nudes. Just because you are anonymous does not mean you can be a disgusting pest.

If it was for the laughs it would be okay, but some of you actually scare me. 1 guy even found my main account. How?

I feel truly sorry for the girls on this platform as I completely understand why anyone would delete their account. 

Sorry, to all the people that were just curious or thought it was funny, but I'm just not comfortable with it anymore. I hope you understand.

htojaq,TIFU by not telling my husband and his parents that I knew their native language and then speaking in the said language in front of them,46487,0.94,1217,2020-07-19 02:57:07,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/htojaq/tifu_by_not_telling_my_husband_and_his_parents/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/htojaq/tifu_by_not_telling_my_husband_and_his_parents/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"I actually posted this on Am I The Asshole few days back. Some people suggested I post this here as well, so here goes. 


This story has four characters ; my husband (28m), me(27f), mother in law and father in law. 

Even though husband and I are Indians, we’re from different states. He’s from North India and I’m from West India. MIL thinks I don’t know their native language. Thing is,I do understand it. I’ve picked up a lot of words and phrases from hearing my husband speak and and from songs etc. I understand enough to comprehend. 

We could be at dinner at my in laws house and the conversation would go like this : 

MIL : *switches to her native tongue and makes some  remark about me.* 

Husband: *defends me in native tongue. Asks her to stop* 


This used to be very funny to me because these people thought I did not know what they were saying about me and I found his mother’s remarks very Indian mother-ish. Nothing offensive really. 

For example, she’d say to my face that the food I cooked is tasty but then switch to her native language and go,’ There’s so much salt in it. Is your wife trying to give me a Blood Pressure problem?’ Sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face. 


Few days back, we were face timing with my in laws and my MIL says something in the native tongue. This is where the fuck up happens. I wasn’t paying attention and I thought she spoke to me so I replied in the same language. Now, I didn’t even know if I could speak it since I’d never really tried. I thought it was more of a ‘I understand but I can’t speak it’. If the ‘surprised pikachu meme’ was real, it would be the expressions of my husband and his parents. I don’t think I’ll ever forget how their faces looked. I wish I could’ve taken a pic. 


MIL has been sugary sweet to me. She’s been sending all these ‘good mornings’ and ‘hope u well’ texts to me.I hate this new MIL. I prefer her subtle way of being fake than her obvious way of being fake. I feel like I lost a super power. I won’t get to hear MIL’s running commentary about me. Those were entertaining af. I looked forward to family dinners just for her taunts which she thought I couldn’t understand. I really fucked up bad by slipping up.


TL;DR didn’t tell my husband that I could understand his language, had fun while MIL taunted me in the said language, lost this superpower now."
ci6a74,TIFU- By not knowing about sunblock expiration dates,46459,0.93,3119,2019-07-26 23:36:12,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ci6a74/tifu_by_not_knowing_about_sunblock_expiration/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ci6a74/tifu_by_not_knowing_about_sunblock_expiration/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,True,False,False,"I applied SPF 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

I pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

The blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

I had no clue. 

I went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

It was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


This was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

EDIT- I want to clear up: I'm naturally, very pale person, I was at high altitude while on and in the water. I do not blame anyone but myself for this. Whether expired or I stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. I should have been careful with making sure the things I use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
I agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, I just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
This isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

I'm not planning to sue anyone although I appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
I just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! Be safe! Skin cancer is a real danger.

TL;DR- Sunblock expires."

I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn't until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) Beforehand, I jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies ""Don't worry, if that were you and I, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, ""I guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in [my car] though"". I then replied ""You know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.

TLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf


Edit: There is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

t407dj,TIFU by not telling my husband about a lottery I won years ago,46283,0.88,5705,2022-03-01 10:48:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/t407dj/tifu_by_not_telling_my_husband_about_a_lottery_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/t407dj/tifu_by_not_telling_my_husband_about_a_lottery_i/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"Throwaway account because some of my friends/family know my real one

The lottery winning took place back in August 2014. Mike and I were married in October 2014. It wasn't a fortune, but enough to make a difference. After taxes it came out to right around $480,000. Most people would be over the moon, but I panicked. I didn't want our life to turn upside down because we had extra money now.

I was still legally single at the time, and so I was able to accept it anonymously without the need to tell anyone else. So I didn't. Tell anyone else. Not a single soul. Not my husband, my parents, siblings, best friends, etc. Only the state and federal governments.

(My husband has a tendency to spend on things we don't need and that aren't going to benefit us in the long run so I didn't want our money to blown quickly on stupid stuff like cars and clothes.)

I opened a new bank account with a national credit union and put the check in. Got started with a financial advisor (Keith), who guided me into investing in local businesses and real estate. And that's that. It's been sitting there since, just growing.

Flash forward to today. I'm doing dishes getting ready to start making dinner, and my phone rings. I can't get to it but figure I'll call them back. Then I get a text. No big deal. I'll get to it in a minute....but husband came into the kitchen and glanced at my phone to let me know who text me and called me (which he always does if my hands are full).

It's Keith. He called and text me to let me know my account just hit $1 million after one of the energy companies I invested in soared recently.

My husband is stunned. Has no clue what to even say, staring at me until he says ""we have a million dollars??"" I was so flushed but finally just sat him down and explained the situation. He's clearly mad at me for never telling him. Asks if my family knows, and I tell him that no one knows except the IRS and Keith.

It took him a few hours to finally be able to really talk to me.. at the end of the silence he told me he's proud of me for investing into our future but he needs a few days to clear his head because he feels like I hid a huge part of ""myself"" from him.

We might just need to take a vacation now.

TL;DR I won a lottery in 2014 and never told my husband until he learned that I grew the money to a million today.

Edit: I already have people messaging me asking if they can have money. Jesus. This is why I didn't tell anyone!!

Update! My husband and I just spoke on the phone for about an hour. He told me he's staying with his best friend/coworker tonight but that he's not angry. He agreed he would have spent the money on dumb things if he'd won it and is happy that I put it away. Little less happy that I didn't tell him about it for so long, but he said he doesn't care and doesn't want this getting in the way of our marriage.

Update!!!: Hello! Jesus I didn't know this would blow up so much. I've been at work and talking to my husband Mike all day, basically laying down some ground rules for the money moving forward. He will not tell anyone (didn't tell his friend!) and we will only dip in for emergencies and pre-discussed things. A few people asked in the comments how much we make a year, I guess to see where we'd be without this money. I currently make around 60k and Mike makes more at around 85k. So to all the ones saying I ""starved him"" or ""made him scrounge"" that is not true lol. We make a good amount.

I have no clue how to post all of the screenshots of the clowns in my inbox, but I'll try to put something in the comments!!"

Well, thanks to the incredible support of the reddit community (I got hundreds of pms urging me to go for it yall be crazy lol) I asked her out. And guess what....

After promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! We're going out this Friday for a dinner. I know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what I happened I think I’m kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. 

Thanks for giving me the support to do it guys. I was gonna flake-out.
So remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. If it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

TL;DR. Gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. They laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. Reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. Somehow it worked. What the hell.

7eueeg,TIFU by not going to the hospital when I knew something was wrong with me,46255,0.91,2489,2017-11-23 02:53:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7eueeg/tifu_by_not_going_to_the_hospital_when_i_knew/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7eueeg/tifu_by_not_going_to_the_hospital_when_i_knew/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,,False,"As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...

Sunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

As I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

I got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.

I woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.

I woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.

I went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!"" (Dave Chappelle voice)

The Dr. came flying into the room and said, ""Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!""

My life stopped. ""A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?"" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

What happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, ""couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" She told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

As I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

My parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!

The first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

But wait...there's MORE!!!

6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

I awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

The surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

Fast forward, to October 2, 2017.

My vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

I could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

I was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

I did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...

I was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.

What this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.

I refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.

I tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

I thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health

We’ve been super lucky to have 1 baby through in vitro fertilization and we are in the middle of trying for a second that way. 
This involves a shitload of fertility drugs. One of those drugs is an estrogen supplement she has to take vaginally. 

Infertility really messed with our sex life, especially at the beginning. The past few years though, we’ve worked really hard on getting that spark back. Thanks to IVF, sex isn’t for baby making anymore, it’s for connecting with each other and having a grand old time. So we get it on a few times a week and it’s fantastic. Because of our fertility issues, this guy hasn’t used a condom in 6 years. 

I’m usually a pretty happy guy. The past few weeks though, I was in what has to be the worst mood anyone has ever had. I had a raging headache, wanted to cry every 5 minutes and had so much irrational rage about everything. My wife is obviously concerned and asks what the hell is happening to me. I’m concerned about myself to and we try to figure out why I was in such a terrible mood. Then we finally realized our fuck up. 

She has been taking her estrogen supplement before we go upstairs for bed where we usually have some sexy time a few times a week before going to bed. Since I haven’t been wearing a condom my penis has basically been taking an estrogen bath several times a week and we think I’ve been absorbing the estrogen through my penis. I’ve been wearing a condom (boooo) for about a week now and I am pretty much back to my normal happy self. On a side note, I have a whole new understanding of the pure hell she goes through just to give us a chance at having another baby. 


tl;dr - my wife has been taking estrogen supplements vaginally and I accidentally took them penis-ally without realizing it

Edit: wow I never had a post blow up this much. 

For everyone going through infertility or dealing with endometriosis - know that you’re not alone and it’s awesome to be able to talk about it with others. Find a good support system even if it’s strangers on the internet. 

For everyone leaving mean comments, I’m sorry if you don’t agree with my and my wife’s life choices. Try to have a little empathy and grace for other people when you have zero idea what they’ve been through. Yes adoption is a fantastic option. We went down that path for 2 years through both private adoption and through the foster care system. I wish it was as easy as everyone in here seems to think it is, because if it was, we would have adopted a long time ago. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. We have a heart for the foster system and when we have the space we plan on fostering along with raising our own kids."

Well lo and behold, they BOTH ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! They ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. They could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

Yesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

Well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.

Fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.

TL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

Edit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. I covered up personal info so I don't dox him or myself.

I think in ninth grade she told us that he's gay, honestly never got the impression that he was.

 I mean sometimes you can absolutely tell when a guy is gay without even really knowing him. Anyways we went to  a little trip in the forest, usually when we go on such trips, my daughter takes one of her good friends with her. This time she wanted her guy friend to come with us.  

We had a great time in the forest and had planned to sleep over at a hostel. My wife and I slept in one room and my daughter and her friend slept in different rooms. I was ready to go to bed, when my daughter asked if she was allowed to, go out with her friend a little and just walk around in the area.

 It was already late but I said yes. I actually wanted to stay awake and wait for them to come back, but unfortunately I fell asleep. I woke up at 1am and wanted to check if they had returned safely. So I knocked on my daughters door, no response .

I opened the door, she wasn't in her room and I started to panick. I immediately went to her friends room, knocked and there was also no response so I walked in. The room is kind of seperated , so when you come in you don't immediatly see the bed or anything, it's like a little hallway. So at this point I could already hear noises, not necessarily moaning but yeah noises. And I don't know why but my mind couldn't process this and I just went in further. 

I was standing there, it was dark so I didn't see them, naked. I kinda had a WTF moment and said eww what are you guys doing. Really didn't mean to say that.  My daughter screamed  that I should get out, and , I said I thought he's gay, and just walked away. This morning I woke up and both of them had gone home. I guess that means more quality time with my wife.

TL;DR 
Daughter always said her guy friend is gay, but I caught them doing the nasty while we were on a trip, and they both went home.

For those of you wondering my daughter is 17 and her friend is 18.


Edit: I just took a nap, and woke up to 19000 upvotes and so many comments, like I was wondering why is my phone vibrating so much. 

Anyways I'm still at the hostel with my wife . I was on the phone with my daughter , and she told me that he isn't gay. Y'all and guess what!!. They have been dating for TWO DAMN Years. ( In september is their 2 years anniversary, so 1 year and 10 months idk) If you do the maths, two years ago my daughter, was in ninth grade, and that's when she told us he's gay. Everything makes sense now. But think about it, they hid it for TWO GODDAMN YEARS.


Edit 2: A lot of y'all have been asking why my daughter was hiding the fact that they were dating. She told me, that she didn't think the relationship is goint to last this long, and since the guy is sort of a family friend, they would have ruined it, if they would have broken up in a matter of a few weeks, but told us about the relationship, because then it would be akward for him to come over. 6 months in, they actually wanted to tell us, but it was always the excuse :,, yeah we're going to tell them next dinner"". My daughter actually pointed out all the hints they made, for us to figure it out on our own. I missed all lol. And her saying that he's gay, well  you guys know why. She felt like there had been too much lying involved, to tell us so yeah.

Edit: Ok that's the last edit, I need to go to work. But the reason, why I'm not mad at her is, just think about it we've all been teenagers at some point and did atleast some sort of sneaky thing. I met my wife when I was 15, and my wife lied about going to a girls sleepover, but she always slept over at my place. So yeah that's our daughter she took our sneaky genes."
on43ul,TIFU because my 4 year old asked why daddy was kissing mommy's butt,45934,0.81,2423,2021-07-19 07:04:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/on43ul/tifu_because_my_4_year_old_asked_why_daddy_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/on43ul/tifu_because_my_4_year_old_asked_why_daddy_was/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"TL;DR: Got caught going to brown town on my wife by my 4 year old daughter because I didn't lock the door.

This happened literally 10 minutes ago. I'm dying laughing. My wife is mortified.

My wife and I haven't had a whole lot of alone time recently. Our 4 year old hasn't been sleeping well and comes to our bed to snuggle and sleep with us most nights. Tonight, after a few glasses of wine, we decide that tonight is the night. We tell our daughter to leave our room, and shut the door on the way out. I did NOT however, tell her to lock it.

Shenanigans begin. Now, I like eating my wife's ass. It's just what I do. After a few minutes of getting to business, my wife starts frantically hitting me on the head and shouting, ""Babe babe babe!!"" I look up from my wife's thighs and see our 4 year old, LITERALLY IN BED WITH US, laughing her ass off, and the first words out of her mouth are, ""Why is daddy sniffing your butt??"" I immediately extracate myself from the situation, roll over, and die laughing into my pillow.

About this time, our 18 year old walks up to our bedroom door to check in on the situation. My wife and I, both clearly naked under the sheets, are dying laughing as our 4 year old reports to her big sister, ""I saw daddy kissing mommy's butt!"" Our eldest knows exactly what just happened and she herself starts dying of laughter in the doorway. A mixture of humor and terror overtake my wife, and finally she gives in and starts laughing her ass off. We eventually banish our little gremlin back to her bedroom and our eldest makes popcorn and goes back to her room.

I'm lying here with my wife right now, laughing our asses off, drinking wine, and watching ""Veep"" for the 50th time.

Edit: We are about 30 minutes out of the.... Incident. My wife is freaking out thinking what our daughter is going to tell her daycare teacher tomorrow. She keeps rubbing her forehead saying, ""I can't believe what just happened.""

Edit next morning: Haha, my wife (also on Reddit) is floored by these comments. Little one has not brought it up again... Yet.

Edit again: You wanna eat ass? Read. Posted this as a reply to another post but probably good for the general populace.

I agree, it's a weird concept. The first time I went all the way down was with one of my first girlfriends in college and of course we were both drunk as skunks. She was naked with that caboose in the air, and I thought ""Fuck it. Time to get to business."" And... damn. Anybody who reads this, and I've said it before.... Eating ass isn't eating shit!!  Take your hand, make a fist, and lick the center. That's what eating ass tastes like. It tastes like NOTHING. It's just skin. If it tastes like shit... I'm sorry, you got a nasty woman who can't wipe properly.  I'm not trying to brag, but my woman is a fucking smoke show and will get it day or night.

Ok maybe bragging a little bit."
qulzyd,TIFU by showing my girlfriend my actual strength,45885,0.86,7407,2021-11-15 23:16:06,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/qulzyd/tifu_by_showing_my_girlfriend_my_actual_strength/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/qulzyd/tifu_by_showing_my_girlfriend_my_actual_strength/,self.tifu,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"Standard – this did not happen today. Actually a few years back.

So, when my then gf and I started dating, I discovered early on that she can be quite physical. In the sense that she likes to push, hold, punch even. Bare in mind she is not actually trying to hurt me, she is just playful like that. I found this both adorable and fun, so I played along.

And here is the fuck up… If she pushed me, I would act like I had to balance myself, or if the bed/sofa was nearby I would fall onto it. If she held me, I would pretend that it was difficult for me to get out of her grip. If I pushed her and she resisted, I would pretend it was hard work, same with me holding her arms etc. You get the idea.

I always assumed she knew I was playing along and not actually physically straining myself to compete with her strength. This went on for months.

One day, we were chilling on the sofa, watching a show when I realised, I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I need to shower and make a move, she decided this was a good time for a playfight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and “struggled” to move her off me. A little more ‘wrestling’ took place, with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold/push me back onto the sofa. Eventually I decided I need to ‘win’ this little fight and get going. So, I got her onto her back, held her hands near her head and leant down to kiss her on the cheeks a few times and let her know again that I am running late.

She tried to move her arms and could not. Whilst struggling she grunted out. ‘Why are you so strong today.’

I laughed (fuck up No2) and looked at her like she was joking.

Her eyes went wide with comprehension and she stopped struggling. ‘You are always this strong?’ She asked, almost to herself.

‘Come on babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you?’ I replied.

I then went to take a shower, got ready and as I was heading out the door, I noticed that she might have been a little glum. Me, being fully aware that I do not fully comprehend the mystery of female emotions, had no clue why she was upset. I did what all men do, I guessed. I gave her a kiss and said I won’t be gone for long and that I can pick up her favourite Chinese on the way back. I assumed she was upset about me not spending the afternoon with her.

No reply. Fuck up No3 – I should have spent some time talking it through. I instead went on my merry way and had a great fucking time with my friends. She spent the next few hours brewing, simmering, seething, and of course overthinking.

I came home with the Chinese and as soon as I put it down on the dining table, she sprung out of the corner and attacked me. It genuinely surprised me and I reacted by bear hugging her to my chest. She struggled with more force than she normally would and I just held her, I kept asking what was wrong. She gritted her teeth and said. ‘You lied to me.’ Eventually she stopped trying to fight me and I let her go. She then told me how she feels like I lied to her about our ‘fights’ and that really all the time I was laughing at her in my head as I pretended that she was actually winning.

I tried to take the conversation seriously, but come on, how the fuck am I supposed to take this seriously. So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.

A week later she broke up with me. FML

TL;DR I pretended my girlfriend and I we were of equal strength.

Edit 1. Haha this got a lot more attention than I was expecting!

Firstly, there's a lot of she's so ""stupid"", ""crazy"" ""insane"" etc...it's a bit mean. Yeah, she reacted errmm drastically but overall she is a good person.

Secondly, it's shocking how polarizing the comments are. There's a lot of comments along the lines of ""How the fuck did she not know"" and honestly loads of comments from both guys and girls about how girls can be surprised when they first realise the difference in raw strength.

Big shout out to  [u/starbrightstar](https://www.reddit.com/u/starbrightstar) for her comment. It's one of the top comments, and rightly so."

Being the very intelligent man I am, I of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. I instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. A small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

The worst part is, I still didn't realize what I had actually just done. I just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. As I grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that I had almost electrocuted myself. Maybe I was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. If I had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, I would have gotten an electric shock.

I haven't told anyone yet, and I don't think I will.

This happened an hour ago, currently relaxing in bed with the boyfriend.

Because we work together we come home together,  and neither wants to wait their turn so we've decided why not just take showers together, plus it saves water, apparently. We are not cheap, just saying.

Today was all the same. Wake up, go to work, come home, and shower. But not even military training would've prepared me for what was about to unfold. My sweet himbo of a boyfriend is lactose intolerant. He does not care and continues to eat lactose and has the most gut-wrenching, eye tearing, vomit-inducing poops, and farts. Today it was a coworker's goodbye party and she brought a tres leches cake, which is a 3 milk cake. And him being the clueless man that would trade me for cake, he takes a HUGE piece. And it hit him hard. It hit him while we were showering.

Most of us know that in the shower the smell after you fart is so much more intense. Now, this is where shit happens, literally. After being under the shower for about 5 or more minutes the tiny bathroom is filled with steam and my boyfriend while shampooing my hair exclaims loudly and lets out the longest, loudest stinkiest fart that I've ever had displeasure of experiencing and runs to the toilet, holding his ass.

You would think someone was cutting trees with a chainsaw because holy shit it was so loud my mouth dropped and I could TASTE the disgusting gas that was once a tasty tres leches cake. I started heaving and gagging which became worse after this huge man nestled on a tiny toilet dropped what you would think was a nuclear bomb. It was: Wet, loud, and smelly to the point of me almost throwing up on the spot. I instead rushed to the sink that was right next to the toilet that I kind of felt bad for, and started just projectile vomiting my breakfast, lunch, and the tres leches cake that will be gone but not forgotten.

Every time I inhaled, the absolute nuclear shit fumes hit me like an 8 wheeler and I kept vomiting harder and harder. This whole fiasco ended up in me almost passing out and my poor boyfriend who couldn't stop shitting his absolute blood, sweat, and tears out could not do much to help except shit more. And more.

We ended up taking separate cold showers and airing out the windowless bathroom by opening the bathroom door and the front door which gave us weird looks but I'd rather not die and have ""Death by poot"" on my gravestone.

EDIT: Oh my God! I didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. The fart beast is now considering Lactaid... or a cork. Thank you for the awards! We are both doing great! And to the people saying he's rude or inconsiderate or farting in front of each other is gross, we are doing great in terms of our relationship and each other and have been talking about marriage. 

TL;DR: Me and my lactose-intolerant boyfriend took a shower together after he ate a milk cake at work and him shitting his soul out almost made me pass out."

Coconut oil.

It’s great! It’s solid until it’s on your skin and then it’s a wonderful long lasting lubricant that tastes delicious, and is easy to clean up afterward.

It’s been my go too with my partner for a few months now whenever I’m down on that ass. 

What is the FU you ask? 

Me and my coconut oil loving partner decided on a Thai food double date.

My partner orders a bowl of coconut curry.  I get some fried rice.

See where this is going yet?

She offers me a bite of her curry, I accept.

Instant Boner. The curry tastes just like I’m going to town on her booty. Coconut oil heaven. 

So there I am, rock hard, sitting at a table with our best friends. Doing my best to hide my extremely inappropriate physical reaction to an otherwise perfectly delicious but decidedly not sexy coconut curry.

My partner thinks this is wonderful.

🥥🍆


TLDR: Ive Pavlov’d myself into getting a boner whenever I taste coconut."

My ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""Dad! Kick me!""

So I did.

Hear me out, please. The kick was a 3/10 on firmness. Not gentle, but not painful. He's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, I feel like I need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. I also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

Anyway... I performed a front kick whilst making the Bruce Lee Noise. I trust that you know the one. 

My son recoiled. He looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. He didn't cry,, but it was close.

He blurted out ""I said KISS Me!!!""

Oops!



TLDR; I misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him."

My roommate made me an omelette and brought it to me at my desk.  I was really happy that they went out of their way to cook for me. 

However when I took a bite I was in for a suprise. It was a cold omelette with horseradish Swiss cheese, sour raisins, and prunes. It was... disturbingly gross. I couldn't even swallow one bite. I really couldn't eat it.

Later in the day, my roommate came by to ask how it was. I was mostly distracted with work so I just said that I was thankful he cooked for me. 

Because he doesn't cook a lot, I thought that I wouldn't have to address the abomination and we'd just go back to usual. Well... He took the positive encouragement and has started expirementing with all kinds of wierd flavour combinations.
 
This morning I woke up to a garlic, cheese, and dried cranberries omelette and it was even worse than the first. I feel like I'm in too deep at this point. I don't have the heart to tell him that I don't like even like omelettes. I like plain scrambled eggs. 

Tl;Dr- My roommate made gross food. I thought it was a one time thing so I gave positive feedback. Now my life is wierd wierd omelettes.

Edit: holy cow. This blew up. Just sending love and good vibes to all. May all your food be tasty, and all your roommates be as nice as mine, but may they be much much much better cooks.

Update: for everyone offering advice, the plan is definitely to communicate that this combination is
... heinous, but in a nice and respectful way. I'm sure they would appreciate knowing what I actually like so that their effort is edible AND a really nice thing

Final update: we spoke, next day he made a plain egg for me. And I made tacos for both of us. So wins for all."

I had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. 

About 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.

We would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn't been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

Two days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

I waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.

The next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, ""before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" She was silent. I asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. So that's a win I guess.

Planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn't told her yet. Still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I'm keeping my head up.

TLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now.

Edit: Wow! Thank you all for the encouraging comments! They help so much more than I would've thought. Some of these really got to me, and reading that I should've posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. Most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a FU on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. Thank you all, so much! Going to read through and respond to as many as I can.

This was about 10 years ago. 


I started doing stand up when I was in the army - in Afghanistan, actually. I started telling stories around the fire at night, but eventually started doing ""shows"" in the chow hall or during talent shows if we were on a bigger base at the time. It wasn't uncommon for me to do so badly that I lost people during these shows; I even had a platoon opt to go on patrol early rather than watch my whole set. I was less fun than possibly dying. 

I wanted to get better, so I ordered a book and started working on trying to improve crowd work (talking to the audience) and being more physical. I figured if I could make the interpreters laugh with the language barrier, I'd be on my way to being a better comic. 

During our next patrol, we detained several suspected Taliban fighters. We needed to keep them on our base until they could get picked up by Intel people, so we needed to watch them for 2 days. I thought the idea of a literal captive audience was too good to pass up and basically tried to do crowd work and run bits by them in an incredibly animated manner. Imagine Sebastian Maniscalco, but 2 months into comedy. I volunteered for as many guard duty shifts as I could. I'd try jokes, I'd ask for their names and where they were from, jobs, e.t.c. anything I could try to make a joke about. Never a single laugh. 

Eventually, they got picked up and apparently one complained about my jokes specifically. I ended up getting a stern talking to for ""unconventional interrogation"" because I kept asking where they were from and what they did and had to explain that I was so bored and desperate to get better at comedy that I almost inadvertently committed a war crime. 

TL;DR: I performed stand up comedy for detained Taliban members that went so badly they accused me of war crimes. Got a stern talking to for that."
hz5xdz,TIFU by falsely claiming to speak fluent french to my wife’s parents 6 years ago and now we’re going to Paris together,45461,0.9,4310,2020-07-28 07:33:36,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hz5xdz/tifu_by_falsely_claiming_to_speak_fluent_french/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hz5xdz/tifu_by_falsely_claiming_to_speak_fluent_french/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This fuck up started 6 years ago when I met my wife’s parents for the first time. Thought I had been determined to make a great first impression, ma and pa weren’t thrilled about their country girl being stolen away from them by a city boy. 

Conversation was stiffer than John Mayer’s penis at 4 am on a friday night, but somehow it veered into the French category. I think we were talking about the civil war. Ma stated she’d always wanted to learn the language. I thought I’d win her over by telling a joke: 

”A few years ago I didn’t speak any french, but now I can speak fluently - apparently it is parler liquide”

Well, they didn’t quite catch my wit, apperently speaking neither french nor sarcasm. Before this, they’d been cold to me at best, but now they were treating me like I was the queen of france - before the revolution. At first, I thought they simply loved my joke. Ooh-ing and aah-ing. Asking me to speak more french. Weird, I thought, since the joke wasn’t that funny, but maybe it was their cup of tea? Glass of wine? Jokes about french maybe was their thing. I proceeded to recite the only other french joke I know:

A cat named 1-2-3 and another one named un, deux, trois were crossing a river. One made it avross. Which one? 1, 2, 3 because un, deux, trois, **cat**-re sinq. 
 They loved that one too. Looking back on it, they didn’t understand it at all. 

When they started asking me about where I learn it, how long it took, if I’d be willing to teach them, it dawned on me. It being the first time meeting my wife’s family, me fearing the awkward, and her dad looking like he chops trees with his bare hands, I made the split second decision to lie. 

And lied I have these past 6 years. My relationship with my wife’s parents has grown steady. I’ve spent far more time with them than I ever anticipated. I would have been comfortable coming clean to them, had it not been for the fact that the frenchness is my entire identity, my being, my worth to them now. I have become a caricature. Fearing they’d suspect otherwise, I way overdid it early on which means I’ve had to keep it up at express pace this entire time. My wife thinks it’s hilarious, which is why she hasn’t said anything, and the lie has gone on far too long for me to say anything. Every christmas the family gets together and I gift them french wines, despite never having been there. I sometimes say ’merde’ after intentionally dropping something infront of them and I even learned how to make baguettes. I occasionally wear a beret and they love me for it.

So much so that they decided to invite the entire family to Paris for their 30th anniversary next year (after the pandemic). They’re so excited and they’re talking about how I can translate for them and ”take them places only locals would know off” and how I’ve ”inspired them to finally visit France”. My wife’s parents are no wealthy people, it is a grand gesture from them paying for my vacation to Europe. I know I’ve got to tell them. I can’t back out of it, my wife would kill me. And I can’t wait for them to find out in France, my wife would kill me. 

It’s so frustrating because it’s such a small fuck up that has built up to this tremendous thing over the past few years. I have no idea what will happen once they know, but I’m not eager to find out. 

TL;DR: Wife’s parents didn’t understand a joke, thought I spoke french. Me being afraid of awkwardness, doubled down and became über-french despite speaking no french at all. Now they’re taking me to real french people and I am screwed."
d288es,TIFU by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended,45360,0.84,1289,2019-09-10 19:54:47,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d288es/tifu_by_tricking_my_hospitalized_brother_into/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d288es/tifu_by_tricking_my_hospitalized_brother_into/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. My brother and I have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). This agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so I was convinced he still remembered.

A couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". Eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. I got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. I decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

Near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. There's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. So I went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""[brother's name], if you're watching this, I'm already dead. Everyone on the world pretty much is. It's been about eight months since you went to [hospital name]. You need to head for the safe haven in Helsinki (we live in western Canada) - mom might be there. God speed."" I managed to sync it up to the TV and woke him up as it was starting.

This is where it all goes to complete shit. My brother began to lose it immediately. He started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. I grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. Nurses came in and I was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

He got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. My mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. My dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. I'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. I've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

Worth the wait though.

tl;dr: Convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

EDIT: Wow this blew up?! I don't have a ton of time but:

1) I don't want to upload the video. I made it sound tamer than it was, I look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xD

2) The TVs in the hospital had HDMI ports. I just plugged it into my Chromebook. 

3) I can see why people say I made this up for karma, but I didn't create a throwaway to do that.  If I cared that much, I would've posted it on my main account.

4) My mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. She hasn't been happy with me moving (western Canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. She paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem."

hx2wcb,TIFU by Accidentally Free Climbing a Mountain,44894,0.88,2097,2020-07-24 20:07:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hx2wcb/tifu_by_accidentally_free_climbing_a_mountain/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hx2wcb/tifu_by_accidentally_free_climbing_a_mountain/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"So this actually happened yesterday, and I'm still shaken up over it. My boyfriend and I decided to visit Zapata Falls in Colorado after taking a social distance Covid style road trip. We saw the waterfall and it was magnificent. There were tons of people (few of whom wore masks) so we ventured in a side direction. I noticed a very climb-able ridge and trying to be spontaneous I began to climb. Well, after a few minutes I was having trouble finding my footing and looked down to see it would be near impossible to descend. Cue the panicked calls for the boyfriend, who came up after me and told me we needed to get to the top since it would be safer. I'll note at this point it looked like the top wasn't too far off. Spoiler: we were wrong.

As we began our ascent I tried not to look down or up as it became apparent this wasnt just a small ledge that would lead to the top of the fall. Nope, we were free climbing a mountain.

After about half an hour I was panicked. My feet slid at every attempt upwards and I heard the loose rocks I disturbed tumble off. We called 911 from a small flat ledge where we could sit down. The operator was great and told us if we weren't hurt and could make it to the top, there was a trail. That was encouraging enough to press on. In time we came to the top. I clung to the jagged rock as wind raced past while my boyfriend looked for the path. We began to spiral down the mountain, walking diagonally still looking for this trail. Long story short, we never found the trail and we spent hours slowly getting to the bottom. At one point the ground slid and I skinned my leg on a tree trunk, but all things considered we made it down with minimal injuries. 

From there we walked towards the sound of water and soon voices came into the mix, distant but clear. Thankfully we pinned where we parked and used a compass and map of the location to get us to safety. I cried like a baby when we got to the car. Today I woke up feeling sore in every fiber of my being but super grateful to be alive.

Tl;dr: Thought I was climbing a path to see the top of a waterfall, ended up free climbing a mountain and spent 6+ hours trying to navigate out of that situation. Special thanks to TJ the 911 operator who calmed me down enough to make it to the top without incurring an expensive helicopter rescue fee.

Edit 1: I am BLOWN AWAY by how this has taken off. I'm still en route but wanted to note a few things. 1. I have read comments that clarified I did not free climb but instead free soloed. I know nothing of climbing (clearly) and am grateful for the education. I'm leaving it just to further show my climbing ignorance. 2. Regarding that ignorance... I fully agree this was a dumbass thing to do. I should have stayed on the trail. I endangered myself, my boyfriend and any possible SAR that would need to save my tourist ass. I am not normally this person and I will act accordingly in the future. 3. For those who are posting kind words and encouragement thank you. I fully acknowledge that I fucked up and am trying to make the best of it. I did learn a lesson and ultimately I am trying to be gentle with myself as we all make mistakes. Thank you for your empathy. 

Edit 2: I got in late last night but uploaded a video of the initial climb (super grainy don't know why) and a drawn route. In the video we thought that tall rock ahead was the top. It was not. Thank you to all the people who did remind me to stay on the trail out of respect for the park, myself and others. I wholeheartedly agree. Without further ado...

dsqe3i,TIFU by eating the ends off a chicken wing.,44824,0.94,1848,2019-11-07 07:16:41,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dsqe3i/tifu_by_eating_the_ends_off_a_chicken_wing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dsqe3i/tifu_by_eating_the_ends_off_a_chicken_wing/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Yesterday I ate the ends of a chicken wing. Someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so I tried it out. I never expected this to happen. 

I must not have chewed one properly. I got something lodged in my throat. To dislodge it I ate some bread and drank some softdrink. Some pain persisted but I went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

This morning I woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. I walked to the public hospital down the road because I was starting to worry. 

The GP noticed I had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. He immediately sent me off to get an Xray. That showed I have a perforated esophagus. That is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. The ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

To get more information I started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219576/

They consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. It's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. A few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. They said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

Now I'm waiting on the results of the CT Scan which will determine whether I get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. If I'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

TL;DR: I ate the ends off a chicken wing and now I'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**Update:** A surgeon just spoke to me. I have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. They don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**Update 2:** The main surgeon just spoke to me. I'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. The critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. So I can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and I need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

**Update 3:** I had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. It's called a PICC. It's how I'll be eating and drinking over the next week.

**Update 4:** I'm out now and everything seems to be fine! I have another check up on the 11th of December to confirm."

The kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. I was one of the founding members of the X-Men, and I was balls deep in mutant pussy. So, fucking was literally my superpower. I could cure the sick with my cum. Humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. Including the members of the X-Men. So, in this dream, I was fucking Blink and Jubilee. Sparks were flying in the bedroom. I mean, damn. I never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. But deep down in dreamland, I gave *all* the fucks. I experienced the most explosive orgasm. I woke up at that moment.

Oof. I was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. I'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. Especially if you're wearing loose pants. I locked eyes with the passenger next to me. She wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. It had the words ""Best Mom Ever"" on the pillow case. *Of course it had*. At that point I realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. I was too embarrassed to really speak, but I managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. She shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". And then she said this fucking shit: 

""Don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""I'm sorry?""

""I have a son who's also into X-Men""

**Words that will haunt me for the rest of my days.** 

*Edit: Appreciate the Silver & Gold! Last time I checked I had like 5 comments and 3 upvotes. This, I did not see coming. Thanks for all the responses, from the believers to the none believers, you're all equally entertaining! For those of you asking for photos of the pillow, once I got off the plane, I snatched my bags and rushed to the nearest bathroom, where I changed pants. Once I did that, I tossed the pillow in the trash. An Uber was waiting to take me straight to my new job. No fucking way was I gonna bring a ""best mom ever"" pillow into the new office. This fuck up needs no sequel.*

Not more than 30 minutes ago I received a new match on Tinder (yay!). She was cute so I sent her a message saying hi and we talked for a bit and then I got her snap.

On Snapchat she asks if I wanted to play truth or dare and being the horndog that I am I agreed. The questions were innocent enough at first, but then I dared her to send her most recent picture in her camera roll. It was her cleavage (score). In that moment I knew I had succeeded in my dick's desire. I picked dare next because she picked dare. Her dare was to put toothpaste on my dick.

Now, I'm not proud of this but I wasn't super against it at first. I called her out for just trying to see my dick by putting a funny spin on it. I decided to video call her on Snapchat and she watched me pull out my dick and such. I then said that was enough and I didn't wan't to rub toothpaste on my dick but she insisted she would send nudes if I did.

So, I squeezed out some toothpaste, rubbed that bad boy on my cock, and sent a pic to the girl. Not two seconds later I check and she unadded me on snap and unmatched with me on Tinder.

Hoes really be out here getting guys to rub toothpaste on their dicks and leave. Now I'm stuck with a stinging cock and some blue balls.

TLDR: Rubbed toothpaste on my dick and sent it to a girl for a dare and she ghosted me"

She had pre-eclampsia, which is not totally rare. But she only exhibited a headache and none of the other features until her blood pressure shot through the roof. He was born shortly after we were admitted to the hospital and while it was the happiest day of my life I haven’t really had the chance to fully deal with the trauma of walking into a hospital thinking my pregnant wife would get a shot to quell a headache, only to haven’t to confront the reality of possibly walking out alone. I chose not to focus on any of that. Instead, I put my head down and concentrated on the things we could control.

He was in the NICU for several weeks and everyday we had to be strong parents for our son fighting for his life. And of course, once he graduated from the NICU we suddenly had a baby to turn into a full-grown human.

The lack of sleep is real. Plus, post-partum and the grief of not experiencing the full-term has been very difficult for my wife. Meanwhile, I’m a freelance artist who has been getting a lot of work recently after a VERY dry few months. Basically, I’ve had absolutely no time to slow down and think about everything.

This was a transcontinental flight. He was marvelous. Slept almost the whole way, even after our flight was delayed for 7 hours and we spent the entire day at the airport. My wife had held him most of the flight while I caught up on some work. But when her back was aching I took him and I looked for something to watch. I didn’t want anything too stressful and I thought, “Finding Nemo has that Thomas Newman score and the blue and orange will be soothing.” I had completely forgotten about the beginning. Really, really dumb.

But I couldn’t turn it off. Even as the snot out-volumed the tears. In a sense, it was like an ice bath—at first, it stabbed me like a thousand knives but once I relaxed and let it wash over me, I felt that part of me begin to heal.

We’re both starting therapy because we have a man to make and we can’t be good parents without being ones who are as healthy as possible. This is just the beginning as a parent. But, I can’t help but think that maybe ‘Finding Nemo’ helped me figure out just how much I’d been holding inside. Which, is coincidentally kinda the whole point of the film: letting go.

EDIT: I just woke up and when I sat down to feed him his morning bottle I realized my phone was going crazy. This is crazy. I can’t believe how much this has blown up! Thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. I cannot adequately express how much that means to us.

Also, to answer a little bit of a fair question, this is a FU because I didn’t really choose the right venue for this, or stop to think that Pixar is pretty much synonymous with sobbing. Planes already heighten our insecurities so choosing a film that will surely make me cry in that environment was not a great choice."
auoxin,TIFU by telling my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me,44741,0.86,1774,2019-02-26 00:36:15,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/auoxin/tifu_by_telling_my_girlfriend_i_knew_she_cheated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/auoxin/tifu_by_telling_my_girlfriend_i_knew_she_cheated/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,,False,"This happened approximately six years ago, I was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that I post it here. 

&#x200B;

So, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200B;

After a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee'd, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee'd because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. 

&#x200B;

Well, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn't been with anyone else. I hadn't been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200B;

The same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I've been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee'd. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test. The night before we went, I inadvertently discovered that I had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap. "

There are some guys from USA who I talk to while playing GTA on PS.

So we were talking, when suddenly one of the guys’ brother came to his room and hit him (not hard tho, you know, brothers) to make him die in the game. It was kinda funny and we were laughing at him and he was laughing too.

While everybody were laughing I wanted to say that my brother does it to me too sometimes, so I said like “haha my brother also beats me off sometimes”.

So apparently “to beat off” does not mean the same as “to beat”, as you might know. 

Everybody went silent and I didn’t understand why. Then one of the guys understood what I meant and said “do you even know what beat off means?” and I was like “the same as to hit..?”.

So everybody were laughing hard and he explained to me what it actually means. I was embarrassed as fuck and didn’t talk much after it... I feel a little insecure now to talk to them as my English might not be good enough.

TL;DR I thought that “to beat off” is the same as “to beat” and the guys were laughing at me

Edit: Oh my god, just woke up to this. Thank you guys for the love and awards!"
mc5mwl,TIFU by thinking that women have a prostate and engaging in anal sex with my boyfriend for almost a month.,44711,0.79,3921,2021-03-24 18:56:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mc5mwl/tifu_by_thinking_that_women_have_a_prostate_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mc5mwl/tifu_by_thinking_that_women_have_a_prostate_and/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a month, and during the first week of us having sex, my boyfriend wanted me to use a dildo on him to stimulate his prostate. While I was stimulating his prostate with the dildo, he started moaning very loud and his body was shaking as though he was getting an electric shock. I thought that he was faking it, but the moment I saw his penis spraying cum all over my room like a fountain, I was impressed. He asked me if I waned to try it, and my dumb ass, who didn't know that I didn't have a prostate, said yes. So yeah, we did anal sex, and he was repeatedly asking me if he was ""in the right spot"" inside my anus, and my answer was always no. 

We did some research, but we both would always open a page, and always skip to the ""how to"" part instead of reading through the introduction and stuff where they'd usually mention that only men have prostates. 

So basically, we did this for an entire month and I started getting really frustrated because no matter what, we just couldn't find the right spot inside me, whereas my boyfriend would always hit his right spot and sprayed like a fountain all over my room. A very frustrated me, constantly kept searching for results on the internet until this morning, when I finally realised the truth, and how much of an idiot I've been all this time. I swear I don't know who's more of an idiot, me or my boyfriend. Although it's so embarrassing, it's hilarious, and I think on the bright side, atleast my boyfriend had fun having anal sex with me I guess. 

TL;DR :- Boyfriend's prostate orgasms impressed me, and we both engaged in anal sex for almost a month trying to find and stimulate my prostate."

If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.
My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

TL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

The first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. They gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. The conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. The older son ,""Alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at HS and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. On the other hand is my nephew ""Dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. When I pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. Alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and Dan. Being the cool uncle I let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. As she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my Marine Corps days. If he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. But dont go empty handed. I suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. Now that I think of it I was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. So the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 A few days later it occured to all of us Dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. When his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. I however was not buying it. I pulled him aside and got the truth. The boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. He would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. He met a girl and they had been seeing each other. I was happy I could help and could not believe it actually worked. However things went south. 
 A few days after my return to the east coast I received a very emotional call from my sister. She explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""Have you seen this man"" flier on the door. It was a grainy surveillance photo of Dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. The flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. When she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. Now Dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and I told I am not invited for Christmas. Poor Dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

TL;DR.  I royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters."
hrjq04,TIFU by trying to surprise my wife for her birthday and almost getting divorced,44575,0.89,2227,2020-07-15 13:45:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hrjq04/tifu_by_trying_to_surprise_my_wife_for_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hrjq04/tifu_by_trying_to_surprise_my_wife_for_her/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"I'll admit I haven't been the most attentive husband lately. My wife has told me I need to make more of an effort in our relationship or we would have problems. I've tried really hard to invest in our relationship ever since finding out my wife is not feeling as happy as she should be.

This fuck up happened last week. My wife's birthday was coming up. I decided to go big. My wife absolutely loves surprises so I decided to surprise her with a romantic night and lots of flowers and presents. She had to go to work in the morning of her birthday and I had the day off. A lot of time to plan everything out.

I decided, being the idiot I am, to pretend that I had forgotten my wife's birthday just to make the surprise, well, even more of a surprise. The plan was as follows: my wife wakes up and I don't mention her birthday. She thinks I've forgotten it. She goes to work and I get everything ready. She comes home in the evening after work and tadaa!! When she opens the door I'll be waiting for her with gifts, flowers dinner and everything romantic I could think of. Sounds like an amazing plan right? WRONG.

Nothing special happened in the morning and my wife left for work while I slept in. During the day I got everything ready and apart from mildly messing up the desert everything went great. Then it was time to wait for my wife to return. She was supposed to get home after 4pm. 4.30pm nothing. 5pm still nothing. I was starting to get worried and I texted her where she was. Around 5.30pm she read my message but didn't reply. I called her and she didn't answer. I was starting to get extremely worried and texted her if she was okay. Thats when she replied.

She texted me opening up about how she couldn't believe I had forgotten her birthday even after her expressing to me how she had felt neglected in the relationship and wanting me to put in more effort. I, in all my stupidity, still decided to play dumb to make my big surprise work. I told her to just get home so we could talk about it. Big mistake

She told me she was done talking and started mentioning divorce. Fuck fuck fuck. Thats when I called her and she still wouldn't answer. Then I panicked and started explaining everything to her by text. I took pictures of all the things I had done around the house, the gifts the flowers the decorations the dinner everything. I just wanted to surprise her that's all I wanted.

I tried calling her to no avail. She read my messages and after not getting a reply I just broke and started crying. After what felt like the longest wait of my life my wife comes home. She's crying saying she's sorry. I told her it was my fault and we both just cried holding each other. We spent the night crying and cuddling and eating the dinner I made. She told me it was the best thing she had ever eaten (obviously a lie, it was mediocre at best and already cold). It wasn't the surprise I had hoped to give her, I'm just glad to still be married to her.

And yes we are working to fix our relationship. I love this woman with all my heart. I had her permission to share this

Tldr: Wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday and pretented to forget her birthday to make the surprise better. She got really upset and started talking about a divorce. I ruined the surprise trying to explain myself and we spent the night of her birthday crying and cuddling.

Edit: Wow thank you for the kind words everyone! I can't reply to everyone so I just wanted to say I appreciate it here!

For all the concerned people, yes we are getting help and fixing things like I have stated before. I appreciate the concern but with all due respect I'm going to take relationship advice from professionals and not from reddit. It's weird to have people arguing about my relationship when frankly no one knows us or the situation we are in. I just wanted to share this story on here with my wife since we already talked this issue through. Still, reading your personal experiences and what you have gone through is helpful so please do share if you feel like doing so!

And to the people messaging me calling my wife horrible things I sincerely want to say, fuck you. Calling me an idiot is justified, calling my wife horrible is not. 

Edit2: I'm getting so many comments about this that I've decided to address it here. I commented this before but I'm going to put it here too so people can see it better hopefully. Like some have said I wasn't really thinking about her when doing what I did, I made the whole surprise essentially about myself even though I didn't mean to. It was never my intention to make her feel bad even though I now realize that of course she would feel horrible for the whole day after I pretended to not remember her birthday. I've apologized for this and these things were talked about.

Really the only thing I was thinking was about wanting to surprise my wife and not about how my way of going about it was going to make her feel. My dumb logic was that hey, my wife loves surprises so I have to make the surprise as suprising as I can, any way I can. I never intended to make her feel bad but my lack of thinking made that happen and I feel horrible for it."

I was at a tech conference today.  I like to broadcast random WiFi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the Planet Fitness  I thought it would go over well as a joke.  I mean, who hasn't seen ""FBI Surveillance Van"" as a network?

*Holy fuck.*  **Do not do this!!!**

Cops got called.  I got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  They asked a lot of questions.  They had to make sure I'm not a threat.  I cooperated fully.  I have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  I was told I wasn't being charged.  I was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

Flash forward two hours and I go to log into my work email on my phone.  Huh.  Password failed.  Huh, again.  Ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  Pull out the laptop, remote into my work PC.  Go to log in.  ""Your account has been disabled. Contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later I get the text message.

*You are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today’s events surrounding you being removed from the <venue>. You are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. We will contact you when the investigation is complete.*

tl;dr: Immature joke kills career, film at 11.

**EDIT:**  Thank you for the influx of comments and messages.  Most of you are right, I am a fucking idiot.  One doesn't come to r/TIFU to brag about the good shit they've done.  No matter what you say, I'm trying to keep up.  You're helping me cope.

I was on FaceTime with my girlfriend and she noticed I was typing a lot and asked me what I was writing.

I start telling her about diamonds, how they're formed, where they come from and so on. My mind begins to get sidetracked as it always does, and I talk about the different types of stars and how they ""die"" and what the fate of our Sun will be. As she starts to worry about the end of life in our solar system, i get sidetracked again and try to reassure her that we don't have to worry about the Sun swallowing Earth in its outer shell as a Red giant because our neighbouring galaxy Andromeda will already be merged with our galaxy, making it impossible for us to be have a home here anyways. 

As my girlfriend digests this information, she starts to think of how humanity may end completely and how life, and our existence is basically meaningless which sends her into a panic attack, causing her to freeze up, have difficulty breathing, and start crying for about five minutes straight.

Now I'm here, typing this up and trying to get her to relax at the same time by explaining how we are a relatively young species and have a long time to figure out a game plan, though I'm not sure if any of it is really helping.

TL;DR I told my girlfriend the sun will eventually burn out, swallowing Earth in the process and eliminating all life, causing her to have a panic attack and cry before bed."

Upon getting to the door of the stall I noticed that the latch was sort of in between locked and open. I didn't think it would be wise to just open the door because it may well be occupied so I took a couple steps back to look under the stall to see if there were somebody's shoes in there that would tell me if it was indeed occupied....

Two things happened. As I bent down far enough to see under the stall, the occupant was looking under the stall right back at me...awkward...really really awkward. And given the urgency of the situation, the pressure of my leather belt against my lower abdomen caused me to fart, real loud, at that exact moment. I don't know if there are words to describe what seemed like an eternity when we both locked eyes with a loud, slow motion fart going off in the back ground was like. Wanting to laugh but afraid it would cause me to shit my pants, I waddled to an open stall and let 'er rip.

So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

Huh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it's not yours?

Angrily, she answers it's not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

I tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.

So last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

Now the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE

Jesus Christ, I don't even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don't have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

The next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that I'd put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

TLDR : Found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.

EDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

EDIT2 : The [thong](https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU) in question

EDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I'll not be able to keep up! There's too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!

EDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them.

I don’t think I have ever told this story to anyone before. So here goes. 

This happened a few years ago when I was a pre-teen. During the summer, my family and I went back to our hometown to visit my grandparents. We were short on rooms so my sister and I shared the same room the entire summer. We had separate beds, but sometimes my sister would trade blankets with me     because my blanket was thicker and warmer. 

One day during the summer, I discovered porn. But instead of finishing the job when I watched it, I went to sleep that day without completing the experience. I woke up with wet spots on my bed and underwear the next day. 

At the time, i was about 80% sure what came out of me wasn’t pee, so I went on google to figure out what happened. I learned that I had a wet dream. I washed my underwear and my bed sheets but for some reason I did not wash my blanket.

When I went back into my room, I saw my sister had switched blankets with me and I freaked out. I didn’t say anything and just quickly left the room. I ran out of the room and googled “Can you get someone pregnant from a wet dream?” Obviously none of the results I was looking for popped out.

I thought my life was over and I accidentally got my sister pregnant cuz she was using my blanket that had  a little bit of my ejaculation on it. The idea haunted me and I did not tell anybody because I was too scared.

Maybe like a week after that, I finally got the courage to tell my dad that i got my sister pregnant. This was the conversation.

Me: “Dad, remember when I accidentally peed on my bed”
Dad: “Yea?”
Me: “It wasn’t pee”
Dad: “Yea I know it wasn’t pee, you’re going through puberty, it’s perfectly normal.”
He walked away. End of Conversation.

After that conversation, I just decided to wait a few months to see if my sister was pregnant.

Needless to say, she was not pregnant. I was just a really dumb child.

TL;DR I had a wet dream and I thought i got my sister pregnant bc she used my blanket.

Edit: Holy shit this blew up, this is technically my first ever post. I’m glad you guys enjoyed my suffering. I also want to add that I actually didn’t learn sex-ed until 9th grade so everything I knew before was from google.

Edit: Thanks for the awards, it almost makes up for the weeks of anxiety and stress lol"

As cute as he can be, it gets old after a while, and if you've ever had a boy, you know how they can become obsessed with their peckers.

I told him it was the truth, and that is what happened to his sister. His eyes got big and he put his pants on.

Fast forward a couple days and him and his sister have now elaborated on the story, and the Pecker Snatcher is now a man who has a basket full of peckers that he carries with him, and other elaborations on the story. All was good and well until he explained the entire mythology they created to their grandparents and teachers. Now I'm the weirdo. Parenting is dumb.

Now, this money tree is my most beloved plant. I’ve had it for 4 years and we’ve been through a lot together. So when he knocked it over (breaking off 3 of the largest branches in the process) I was PISSED. 

I told my students I’d be right back and thought I muted myself, so I went to assess the damage and yelled “NO” several times. Then I tried to grab him so I could shut him in another room while I cleaned up my plant, but he kept running away from me. At this point, I said/yelled “come here you FUCKING RAT BASTARD!” (A nickname sometimes said endearingly, although not at this particular moment).

After successfully shutting him in another room and quickly trying to salvage the remains of my beloved money tree, I went back to my computer to see the following messages from students in my Zoom chat. “YOURE NOT MUTED” “THAT WAS WILD” “OMG MRS WE CAN HEAR YOU” etc. Let’s just say I had some apologizing/explaining to do after that fuck up. Let’s hope I still have a job tomorrow.

TL;DR: my cat knocked over my beloved plant in the middle of my teaching online, and i thought I was muted when I yelled off camera “you fucking rat bastard!” My students informed me after the fact that they heard everything I said. Big yikes.

Edit to add: [Cat tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bx3HG7Q)

Edit 2: I went back to teaching and came back to my phone seeing that this has blown up :D All the comments have me cracking up. I love this community of cat lovers/haters! Stay safe out there everyone, much love!"

I imagined the evening going down more or less like this: 

1. Slip into a white robe.
2. Stick on a cactus crown. 
3. Moonwalk out of the house as Jesus. 
4. Remember never to break character. 
5. Hop into an Uber. 
6. Show up to celebrate Halloween with friends. 
7. Go HAM.
8. Go home. 
9. Go sleep.
10. Go for a job interview the next morning.

This is what I would've called a good night. However, after #7, things didn't quite go as planned. Here's how shit actually unfolded:

8. Got shit-faced.
9. Drunk me turned into drunk Jesus. 
10. Fell into my friend's swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.
11. Realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities. 
12. Drunk dialed my religious mother in the middle of the night to tell her I'm proof that Jesus is fake as fuck and that I'm gay, gay, gay. 
13. Unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the Uber driver's car on the way home.
14. Missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.
15. Realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.

For the record I apologized to my mom. We cool now.

TL;DR Fell into a swimming pool, got all wet wearing white, exposed my cock to a crowd, roasted Jesus over the phone with my Christian mom, woke up late the next morning and missed my job interview."

We just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

I thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

I think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

My girlfriend said: "" WTF are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

After explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my GF couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. Made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling GF.

**TL;DR:** Accidentally ""unplugged"" my girlfriend while watching a movie creating a mess in my bed

ecs339,TIFU by making my webgame one of the most disliked in Russia,44067,0.94,780,2019-12-19 17:12:15,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ecs339/tifu_by_making_my_webgame_one_of_the_most/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ecs339/tifu_by_making_my_webgame_one_of_the_most/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory it didn't happen today, however I realized my idiocy today.

I am a small game developer part-time (I also have a regular job). Since more than 1 year I have been working alone on a puzzle-platformer that I've been thinking of for 2 years.

It's a labor of love. After about a year of hard work, I had something that I was proud of, and that I considered ready for release. It's a web game and when you release a web game, what you usually do is that you put it on a game portal. Maybe you remember flash game portals where office workers were slacking off on in the 00's (personally for me it was at school). Well they are still a thing except games are not made in flash anymore, but the idea is the same.

Also, when you are a web game dev, it's very well known that russians love web games. So if you manage to have russians liking your games, you are half the way there because you will get tons of players.

So anyway, I was ready to release my game, a bit apprehensive of course, I managed to get my game on a couple portals including a huge russian one.

In Russia, my game got wrecked. Everybody hated it. My game is a 0.8/10. I'm not kidding, I don't think there is a worse game on this portal. It felt like shit, and I was very puzzled.

Today, I showed it to a colleague at my normal job, explaining to him that russians hated my game. I clicked fullscreen. Then I noticed it. The downvote button on that website was overlapping the restart button in the game. So people restarting a level (which happens fairly often) gave me a downvote along the way. I don't know if it's clear so [here is what the buttons look like](https://imgur.com/a/wu6rG9m). You can only see it when the game is fullscreen, which is why I did not notice before.

So here I am, a bumbling idiot. Where any scammer in his right mind would have used this trick for evil and profit, instead I tricked them into burning me to the ground.

TL;DR: spent more than a year making a game, released it on a Russian game portal where the restart button was right under the downvote button. Everybody restarted, everybody downvoted and now I am the proud maker on the worst web game in Russia

EDIT: wow thanks for the load of suggestion everyone! It looks like this post is blowing up, it's a first time for me! I think I'll try out move the buttons, then email the russian portal to explain what happened and ask them if they would reset the votes. Also since a lot of you asked for a link, my game is called [BombHopper.io](https://bombhopper.io/), if mods want me to remove this link I'll gladly comply

EDIT 2: I'm currently at work, so I need to go for a while but I'll check back soon!

EDIT 3: Holy shit this is crazy everyone! Now I have 21 times more upvotes on here than downvotes on the portal. And thanks for the Platinum, Gold and Silver!

EDIT 4: I'm going to bed now but first I'd like to thank everyone who said nice things to me. I really appreciate it. I'm still overwhelmed by it honestly. This post made it to /r/all whooooo! I'll edit again when I get the answer from the portal.

EDIT 5: It took a lot of time to get in touch with the portal, so I forgot to edit this post with the outcome, sorry! But for the few people that still stumble upon it: now BombHopper.io is actually the best rated game on Titotu (the portal) because they were kind enough to remove all the downvotes. But they kept the upvotes! Props to them!"
p24wh9,TIFU by not being able to explain to my wife the existence of a dress that wasn't hers in the wash,44067,0.82,3671,2021-08-11 08:55:31,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p24wh9/tifu_by_not_being_able_to_explain_to_my_wife_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p24wh9/tifu_by_not_being_able_to_explain_to_my_wife_the/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False," 

Friends, my marriage was on the edge of a knife just now. Story time.

My wife (40f) comes into the bedroom with an unknown dress she found in the dryer.

Wife: Where did this dress come from?

Me: It's not yours?

W: I know my own dresses. (At this point she is making light but there is smoldering anger behind those brown eyes and I am legit in danger).

Me: Umm, I have no idea.

At this point I'm scrambling to come up with anything that doesn't make it look like I'm cheating, cause even I realize that despite being innocent this doesn't look good and I'm in trouble. I have no idea where the dress is from. Stalling for time I ask what size it is.

A dumb fucking question. Not her size. Fuckity fuck.

More scrambling and I say: Maybe it was from daycare and sent back with my kid's (3m) dirty clothes?

A stretch but I'm painfully aware the longer this mystery goes on the more screwed I am. No one has stayed at our house in the last 2 years.

The whole time I'm thinking: shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit

I suggest maybe someone is sabotaging me. It sounded stupid the moment I said it but I mean, WTF is happening??

I say: It's kinda nice, maybe you should try it on.

Please no one ever take advice from me ever.

Her eyes are beginning to promise my horrible death despite still seeming amused but don't be fooled, the reaper was at my door.

I'm literally sweating at this point and trying to keep it light-hearted is becoming more and more difficult. Has my dryer wormholed into another person's house in some twisted cosmic joke? Anything is possible now. My wife is losing her humour by the nanosecond as I stare dumbly at this goddamned dress.

I'm at a complete loss and then a revelation comes to me in my moment of need. An epiphany for the ages! A memory to redeem every forgotten thing my notoriously bad memory has forgotten over the years on the daily.

Me: Was it with that skirt my mom gave you?

Wife: \*visible relief as she checks her phone\*

Sure enough there is a picture of the dress in her messages of the items of clothing my mom gave her. High five brain!

Marriage saved to screw up another day!

&#x200B;

TL;DR An unknown dress materialized in the dryer and neither my wife nor I had any explanation for it. This did not reflect well on me, to say the least. Eventually we figured it out and my marriage didn't crash and burn."
90ol0e,TIFU by masturbating in front of my entire family,44035,0.89,2859,2018-07-21 16:43:22,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/90ol0e/tifu_by_masturbating_in_front_of_my_entire_family/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/90ol0e/tifu_by_masturbating_in_front_of_my_entire_family/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

Stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

So, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). 

Not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

And so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.

I was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

Somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

I don’t really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

I snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. 

I’m not going to talk about what happened next, as I don’t want to relive the next few moments.

My father is just disappointed. He hasn’t talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

My mother believes that we should “embrace my sexuality”, and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. 

And I'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it’s a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. 

But it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

TL:DR Returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, I now live in shame."
deb2bh,TIFU by buying my mom an Amazon device.,44029,0.85,1593,2019-10-07 04:44:33,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/deb2bh/tifu_by_buying_my_mom_an_amazon_device/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/deb2bh/tifu_by_buying_my_mom_an_amazon_device/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,True,False,False,"I want to start by giving some background here. I basically live, eat, sleep and breath Amazon. I need something, straight to Amazon. I use kindle and audible daily. Want to stream music, Amazon music. Want a new movie, prime video. Run out of something randomly, ""Hey Alexa......."" Laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. Amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. So when looking for a place to store photos, I see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with Amazon photos"". Naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. Automatically upload photos from my phone? Even better. 

Rewind to September 25th, my mom's birthday. I thought about her gift for a while, but when I remembered she didn't have a smart TV, the answer was easy. I hop on Amazon shopping and use my Amazon credit card to purchase one FireTV stick. She was so happy she could watch Netflix on her TV now. Yay, success! Or so I thought. 

Yesterday I get an email from Amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the Fire TV family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! Not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did I imagine that it would sign in to my Amazon account without even asking for a password. Surely she'd have to use her own account. 

Fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. Eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. Sitting in my mother's kitchen, I glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

I spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. I happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. I'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. I took probably 40 pictures that night for my SO to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my ENTIRE FAMILY to view. I have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

Nobody helped me. The remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where I'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. I didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, I just ran away. 

The worst part, I asked Alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, I'm not sure about that."" Fuck Amazon.

Update: I promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. I talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. However, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

I'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an Amazon ad, I just wrote it how I wrote it because I thought it was funny. I wish Amazon was paying me for this crap. 

I'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. Yes I fucked up, I was a dumbass, that's why I posted it here. Yes, I should have known this could happen. Call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my SO do. It's fun. I don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. It happened. 

Thanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. And thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!

TLDR my sexy pics ended up on my mom's tv at a family party."
j6mrg9,TIFU by realising I got scammed 6 years ago,43945,0.85,1714,2020-10-07 13:12:51,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j6mrg9/tifu_by_realising_i_got_scammed_6_years_ago/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j6mrg9/tifu_by_realising_i_got_scammed_6_years_ago/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened 6 years ago. My laptop with 8 GB RAM stopped working so I showed it to a repair guy. He took the laptop, repaired it, and returned it to me after 2 days. The laptop started working again and I was really happy. However, the speed felt slower than before. Previously, I could open multiple chrom tabs and still be able to play games while they were open but now it would drop a lot of frames and my laptop would start overheating. I thought maybe it’s getting old so that’s why the performance is dropping. So I didn’t care much. 

Fast forward to few days back. The same laptop stopped working again, so I called the same repair guy. He took the laptop again, repaired it and returned it to me in 2 days. This time when I started using the laptop, I could IMMEDIATELY tell something was off. The speed was RIDICULOUSLY slower than before. If opened just 2 tabs on chrome it would still overheat. I checked on YouTube for solutions and came across this video where he said to check on computer settings whether all my ram slots were functioning properly and all my ram cards were being detected. So I open computer setting and guess what I find out? It’s reading only 2 GB of RAM! How the fuck did it drop to 2 GB from 8 GB?! I thought it must be an error so I restarted the laptop multiple times and it still read 2 GB. Then I called the repair guy and asked him about this. He replied “It’s just a minor error. It will fix automatically over time. Don’t worry.” I was so confused. I didn’t believe him so I opened the laptop myself and checked the ram slots and Guess what I find? ONE OF THE RAM CARDS IS MISSING AND the RAM card that was in it was NOT the one that I got with my laptop because I remember it had a stylish border. So I looked up the card number online and found out that it was only 2 GB. I called the repair guy again and asked him about this. He said that he was also repairing another laptop and swapped ram cards by mistake and he was really sorry. So he came home the next day, swapped the ram card with my original one and was about to leave when I asked him “What about the second card?”

RG: What card?
Me: The one that you stole from me years ago. 
RG: I don’t know what you are talking about. 
Me: This is only 4 GB RAM. Don’t try to fool me again. I’m calling the cops. 
RG: Wait wait I’m sorry!! I think I remember now!I’ll bring it! I had forgotten about it!

So he brought it back and now my laptop is as fast as ever. I guess I would have never known about the stolen RAM card If I never called him again. 

TLDR; Laptop repair guy stole one of my RAM cards 6 years ago and I learned that recently. I confronted him about it and after threatening him of calling cops on him, he surrendered and returned it to me.

Update 1: HOLY SHIT!!! I did not expect this post to blow up!! Thanks for all the awards! I have never got these many awards before! Speaking of the theif, I reported it to the customer service of his company. They told me they will take action against him. I will ask them again tomorrow and update it on this post.

Update 2: The guy got fired from his company and got arrested! Apparently he had made over $5000 by selling stolen electronic parts from all his customers. He had stolen things like cameras and graphic cards etc. His company gave everyone of his customers a huge discount coupon in return as a token of apology. The cops are still investigating the whole chain of these scammers. I hope they get caught soon! Also I read most of the comments and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions people had:

1. He obviously did not return the exact same RAM card to me. He must have bought the same model from one of his friends from the chain. 

2. How is this my TIFU? Well if I had investigated this the 1st time my laptop got slow 6 years ago, then I could have not only saved 6 years of slow processing of information, but also prevented others from getting scammed in that time period. 

That fucker got arrested. It’s a shame it took him so long. The lesson we should all learn from this is to be careful with whom you give your products to and try fixing things on your own. Don’t be an idiot like me."

I (22F) I work at a hotel bar in a large city. I worked a particularly slow day and during those shifts I like to talk to the guests. One of them was a 22 year old teacher who was traveling by herself and a guest of the hotel. I get cut early and I decide to go out for a couple drinks. At a bar nearby, I see the guest - she is very clearly drunk and proceeds to throw up all over the bar. Now this part of town is kinda known for sleazy guys and she’s by herself - so I take her back to the hotel and get her in her room safe before anyone can take advantage of her. I leave her my number to text me when she’s awake to make sure she’s okay and she thanks me the next morning and explains she was blackout drunk and barely remembers any of the night. I thought that was the end of it - until my boss pulled me into a room and proceeded to fire me for “fraternizing with a guest”. I explained that I only got her to her room safe and was worried because she was young and alone, but nope. I’m officially unemployed now. For helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel okay.

TL;DR - got fired for helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel room okay.

Edit: for those asking for more information: I did take her in the closest entrance which was the employee entrance. I think this has a lot more to do with it. My boss is not a rapist and didn’t slip her anything. And while I’m thinking of naming them, I don’t want to get at risk of going up against a large company. I’m a broke 22 year old (and I am a girl, for all y’all who thought I was a man) who was living paycheck to paycheck. I can’t afford a lawyer. I did file for unemployment. I appreciate everyone’s well wishes. 

TW: I actually had a very bad episode as a result of this and attempted. I’m in the hospital now and will not have any way to update further for a while.

Edit 2: thank you everyone, sincerely, for all the well wishes. I’m back from the hospital and am staying with family until I’m a little more stable. I appreciate everyone’s kind words and support. I’m unsure if anyone will see this since it’s been some time, but I thought I’d update.

After much consideration, I’ve decided to name the hotel: Viceroy Chicago. Whether or not you decide to stay there is entirely up to you. There are some wonderful people working there, but it seems they place liability above the mental or physical safety of their guests and employees. This is a passage from the email HR sent me:

“In regards to your employment status with Viceroy Chicago, entering a hotel room with a guest, is in violation of Viceroy policy.  Colleagues are not allowed to stay at the property in which they work and Unauthorized entrance/access to any Viceroy space/facility, offices, guest rooms or computer information sources is conduct that Viceroy considers inappropriate and leads to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, which due to the severity of this infraction, we will terminate employment at this point.“

So there you go. Do with this information whatever you wish. I understand their decision from a liability standpoint personally, but not from a moral or ethical standpoint. While I’m the hospital I realized it was best I got out of there now anyway. I wish you all the best."

Let’s call him Gardening Club Guy. 

So I spend the day before plucking, prepping and getting the perfect outfit together for my night with GCG. I ultimately choose a nice little push up bra that matched my undies and made the titties look very nice. I don’t normally wear bras like that, but it seemed like the occasion to.

What started as a great night together, turned into a great morning together, which turned into a great afternoon and evening together! 

I eventually return to my place and start reminiscing of the stellar sex that was had, and decide to shoot GCG a message about how last night I thoroughly enjoyed whatever he did with his tongue that made it feel like there was a tiny tornado rampaging my clit (I firmly believe if your partner does something you like/ that gets you off and you want them to do it again..TELL THEM)

GCG thanks me and then says “ So last night when I was feeling your breast..”

and here I am, getting in the mood to do some reminiscing when all of the sudden GCG drop kicks my life with “...I felt a firm lump on your left breast. I didn’t want to not say anything.” 

So now I’ve gone from horny to horrified in 2 seconds flat. I had just gotten a breast exam a few months ago, so it seemed downright impossible..

At this point, I’m grabbing my breasts like a mad woman trying to feel for any weird lumps, when the deceivingly nice little push up bra thrown over the chair catches my gaze. 

The realization sets in and I start spontaneously laugh-crying. 

GCG got a firm hold of the spillage/over flow of boob that didn’t quite make it into the bra.

He grabbed the fat.

Then proceeded to inform me of his findings.

I thanked him and let him know about my previous cleared breast exam, but welcomed him to come by to feel me up and really show me what he meant..you know, just to be sure. He was happy to hear I had one done so recently and said he’d be more then happy to show me.

Basically I’ve found a super sweet guy who I get along with wonderfully, and clearly doesn’t want me to die anytime soon. I’m extremely thankful. 

TL;DR hook up thought he found a lump in my breast that turned out to just be a fat roll due to an ill fitting bra

Edit: I got a breast exam at my local plannned parenthood yesterday just to be sure. No cancer here, just fat!

Edit: I’m sorry I forgot to tag NSFW! My bad, I really should have seen that one coming. For those asking about planned parenthood, the facility in my area is called a family planning center. They offer yearly exams, information about birth control, std testing etc. I believe they work with planned parenthood. And to clarify the fuck uppery on my part lol, I could have  avoided a really awkward conversation if I had just worn proper fitting clothing."
c5ckus,TIFU by joking about AncestryDNA and 23andMe.,43892,0.88,1250,2019-06-25 23:36:36,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5ckus/tifu_by_joking_about_ancestrydna_and_23andme/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5ckus/tifu_by_joking_about_ancestrydna_and_23andme/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This actually happened over Christmas last year.

My family, including (paternal) my grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having Christmas dinner. 

My grandfather brought up that he did AncestryDNA (or was it 23and me?). I don't remember the exact one, because I can barely think about it. It's hard just writing this up.

It was really cool to hear what he found. He found mostly Scandinavian spread out over the British isles, particularly Wales. We knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% Persian! Very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. He's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

The only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of King George III. The reason why I question this is King George III is recorded as one of the few Kings who never had a mistress. 

However, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of King George III (we are descended from the woman). He mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

ANYWAY, off topic. I thought it was fascinating, and I love hearing what he's found. I brought up possibly using my Christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. I don't think I was really going to do it, I usually use the money to pay bills.

Silence. And it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. Everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

My sister and I look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. My parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. We look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. I have weird Hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. My sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

I always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. I never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair I have such cool pretty eyes. 

Well, okay.

Dad starts first. Dad (D), Mom (M), Sister (S), and Me.

D: There's a chance 3ar3ara_G0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

S and Me: Imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. My sister grabs my hand (I love her big sister ways).

Me: Okay, um... 

D: Your mom never had an affair. This isn't some cheating story.

Me: Wha.. (I start to feel very sick).

M: I hoped to never have to tell you this. I was raped. The reason we're not sure is because your dad and I had sex earlier that day.

Me: (I want to die, I start crying). Everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

D: Your grandparents know.

S: Okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

M: No, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

Me: He's still out there?

S: But obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

My dad and mom look at each other. 

M: It was my brother.

I felt so sick. I felt... dirty. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I couldn't stop shaking. My sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. We probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

Our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

The rest of the vacation was just weird. If it weren't for my nephews, I'm pretty sure I would have just gone home.

Oh my nephews are wonderful.

Well, we came home, and I had to battle with the ""Do I want to know?"" thoughts. I could get a DNA test. But I couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. But it weighed on me too much. I had to know in order to move forward. So I asked my dad if he would submit his DNA with mine. We weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. It was hard asking him to not say anything to her. He should be able to talk to his wife.

So we submitted the test. 

I am my father's daughter. I cried when I got the results. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.

I made a decision not to tell my dad - I wanted to surprise them. I kept saying I hadn't gotten the results back. I did tell my sister though.

I gave them the piece of paper on Mother's Day. I was going to wait until Father's Day, but I couldn't. So I got a blank card. 

Inside I wrote: ""Mom, Open the paper."" She opened it and I had written Happy Mother's Day, and Happy Early Father's Day. 

Lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

Thank God.

EDIT: left out half a sentence, oops. 

It was my uncle on my mother's side. I have met him. My sister and I were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

Family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

My parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. Two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. Incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there I guess was his reason. Plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

My mom didn't go No Contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. Why that long, I have no idea. Those are her reasons. 

She did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. I guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

Grandmother is dead now.

This happened in Louisiana. 

EDIT 2: Mods, if this isn't considered appropriate for this sub, please feel free to take it down. I thought I fucked up by the secret coming out in the first place. But it is a happy ending. I leave it up to you glorious mods.

**TL;DR:** I found out I could have been the product of a rape - by my Uncle. Anxiety and tears ensued. Found out I am my father's daughter. Surprised them. Happy Ending!"

My husband and I have been married for 5 and a half years now. My husband was raised by a single mom, and my mom passed when I was 16, so each of us only had one parent at the wedding.

Our parents met during the wedding planning, and quickly discovered how much they had in common and how well they got along. After a few too many glasses of wine, they danced together at the wedding reception.

We noticed a little bit of flirtation between them, but didn't think much of it until they started seeing each other regularly after the wedding, going out together for drinks, going on walks together, going fishing together. Even though it was a little weird for us that our parents were ambiguously and later officially dating each other, we truly didn't care because they just seemed so happy.

Yesterday, my husband walked his mom down the aisle to meet my dad at the altar. My husband's mom and my dad said their vows, and became husband and wife. And my husband and I became... stepsiblings.

Tldr: my husband's mom and my dad started a romance at our wedding, and yesterday they got married, which makes my husband and I technically stepsiblings."

Queue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that ""mommy and daddy use the N Word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry"".

My daughter is **d r a m a t i c**. She would step on a piece of dirt on the floor and fall down screaming ""Me hurt foot"" or hit her head on a pillow and make a huge deal out of it. We don't watch soccer so I have no idea where this behavior came from. 





She is 2. I am her mom so she believes everything I say. I used this to my advantage and told her that kisses fix everything. Stub your toe? Get a kiss. Smack yourself in the face with a broom? Kiss. Cut your finger with the fake knife? Kiss. 








It was going great. She caught on quick and, instead of screaming, always asked for a kiss for her ""hurt"". How could this go wrong? Well I did not foresee the world falling apart and needing to work from home with my 6 month old and 2 year old. 







Some days it's great. They are amazing and the only reason I'm staying sane. Other days.... Nothing makes you reevaluate your decision to have 2 kids 18 months apart like being trapped in a house with them 24/7. *kidding*







Today is one of those days. My daughter was eating her breakfast while I was on a video call. She bit her tongue and started crying. Then she stopped and I saw the look on her face. She recovered and I thought she figured it out on her own and forget about it. 








So here I sit on a very important video meeting and my 2 year old comes running in screaming ""MOMMY KISS TONGUE"". I am trying to shift my 6 month old so I can turn off the audio and video. I managed to mute it (after she screamed of course) but didn't get the video shut off in time. My 2 year old sticks her tongue out and shoves it at me for a kiss as I'm opening my mouth to tell her no. 






And that's how her tongue went straight in my mouth  while all my coworkers were watching. 





Next time on Our Series of Unfortunate Events, she will probably be naked climbing the cabinets in the background. 




Edit: For all of you so concerned that my terrible parenting is the reason my daughter is dramatic - My daughter's behaviors are constantly and appropriately ignored/redirected and she uses a social-emotional program to learn how to handle big emotions in a little body. (Almost like I do this for a living!) She is intelligent, kind, caring, and yes, *dramatic*. She is strong-willed and a performer. She will put on a show even if her teddy bear is the only one watching. 





And yes, I did teach her kisses fix her hurt. That is something I specifically did for MY child because, personally, I don't think it's so bad to live in a world where mama can fix everything, even if only for a little while. 





TL;DR: taught my daughter that kisses fix hurt and she French kissed me"

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

TL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit."
gmtfnu,TIFU by removing my 'earwax blockage',43691,0.93,2671,2020-05-19 23:17:35,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gmtfnu/tifu_by_removing_my_earwax_blockage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gmtfnu/tifu_by_removing_my_earwax_blockage/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Last Saturday, I woke up in the middle of the night. No big deal, but I immediately noticed something wrong with my left ear. I had no pain, but every few seconds I would hear a loud crackling noise in my ear. I have experienced an earwax blocking before, but I had never heard this sound before. This made me concerned, so I tried googling my symptoms, but to no avail.  ""It's probably just an earwax blockage, right?"", I think to myself. I stuffed a cotton pad with olive oil in my ear to soften the earwax and returned to bed. After putting the cotton pad in my ear, the crackling sound stopped, but it was replaced with some soft ticking sounds. It made it hard to fall asleep, but eventually, I managed to drift off

The next morning, the noises in my left ear had stopped. Great, but there was still wax in my ear, because I could hear it move when I put pressure on my ears. Over the course of the next days, I tried to remove the ear wax myself. I put water in my ear, more cotton pads with olive oil and I even tried to get it out with tweezers (I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was impatient and really wanted to just get the earwax out and be done with it). All these methods failed to get the earwax out, until today.

I was once again stupidly poking around with tweezers inside my ear, when I finally managed to grab the earwax. Excited, I took it out and wanted to look at what my ear had just birthed. To my horror, the blockage in my left ear was not caused by earwax, but it was caused by what looked like a kind of tiny moth. This creature had somehow managed to climb into my ear at 2 a.m., caused me to wake up and couldn't leave my ear because of the cotton pad I had stuffed inside.

I am still trying to process that I had a dead moth in my ear for half a week.


Edit: Thank you for the awards and for all of your own ear bug horror stories in the comments! It makes me feel less unfortunate to have experienced this. Also, to answer a common question: I posted a picture of the moth in the comments and people have been asking how big it was. It looks pretty big in the picture, but it was only around a centimeter big.



TL;DR I thought I had an earwax blockage, tried removing it on my own, turned out it was a moth trying to make my ear its home or something."

I was so confused why i was getting 2 drinks and he was equally confused at the fact that i was confused why i was getting 2 drinks. He explained it to me and i realized what i had been doing.

Last night, I was running delivery out to cars. I see Mr. Married. Shifts are limited, so I need cash badly- online tutoring would be great. I virtually body slam my co-worker to deliver his food. On a piece of paper, I scribble my number and march out.

He smiles.

I hand him the food, and then I slip the paper with my number to him.

I blurt, “Tutoring. Your wife wanted me to tutor your son in math.”

He nods slowly, and we both pretend that shit show didn’t just happen as he says, “Yeah. Alright. Okay. Bye.”

I fake a smile and bolt back inside.

Here is a little background leading up to the fuck up. I was 11 years old and began to have really bad pains around my lower back. Went to the doctor and x-rays confirm that I was having a kidney stone. Doctors thought it was highly unusual for an 11 year old to have kidney stones so they made me an appointment with a specialist.

Fast forward a week later, 9/11, I return to a specialist doctor so they could check me out and run more tests. So, my dad and I are waiting in the room waiting for the doctor, playing ""I spy"" or something, and they doctor walks in. He tells us that he wants to check my prostate to see if there is anything unusual going on.  My dad consented and then I was told to drop my pants. 

The doctor puts on his gloves, gets the lube ready and then it was go time. The doctor then checks my prostate, feeling all around to determine is there was anything unusual. Here is where the fuck up comes. While the doc is doing his thing, I look straight into my dads eyes and say ""wow this feels good"".  My dad just looks at me with a blank stare. At the time I didn't think anything of the comment but now looking back, i'm not sure who felt more uncomfortable, my dad or the doctor who was still conducting the test. I cringe every time I think about this now.

Last night while my SO was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. She is a bartender and didn’t want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

Me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. So I jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

While I’m making my journey, I decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. I’m in a pretty great mood. I had the day off and my SO was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some New Girl. 

My journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. Just open desert. So while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. “What can I do to add a little romance to this situation? Cover the bed in some dove chocolates? Maybe some flowers?” 

I make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. Miraculously, I made it back home before her.

Finally I decide, “Nah, romance isn’t nearly as great as comedy.” So when I get home, I break open the box and spell out “Anal?” on the bed with the tampons. 

SO gets home and goes straight to the room to change. I follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

She takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. Now she won’t stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is “famous”. 

I’ve created a monster. 

TLDR; Spelled out “Anal?” with my SO’s tampons. She thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. Reddit agreed and now she thinks she’s famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

Edit: WOW! My first ever medal. Thank you kind stranger. Now at least I can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

Edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. Whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

Edit 3: we are ending this “contest” at 11:59 PST on 7/17/19. It looks like I am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, I would like to say a few things... I had no clue this would blow up like this. I thought I’d get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while I’ve been in here for a year. This has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. 

That being said, please go show her some of that love I know reddit is so capable of showing. She is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments."
l687xn,TIFU by accidentally moaning Ben Shapiro’s name during sex,43607,0.72,1804,2021-01-27 21:59:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l687xn/tifu_by_accidentally_moaning_ben_shapiros_name/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l687xn/tifu_by_accidentally_moaning_ben_shapiros_name/,self.tifu,0,15,,text,True,False,False,"I want to preface all of this by saying that Ben Shapiro sucks, and I’m in no way attracted to him, which is why this is such a monumental fuck up. 

I have found myself extremely amused by all of the Ben Shapiro memes that have been going around. I found the interview where he said, in response to Megan Thee Stallion’s song WAP, that his doctor wife told him women didn’t get wet absolutely hilarious. That’s about the extent of knowledge and familiarity I have with him and his viewpoints. 


The other night I met up with a tinder date. Things were going well and we ended up going to bed together. This is NSFW and sorry for the TMI, but he said “you’re so wet” to which my brain, for some reason, decided this sexy moment was the perfect time to crack a joke. “Don’t tell Ben Shapiro” is what it wanted me to say. With all of my might I tried to force this comment down, not wanting to bring up Ben Shapiro during sex for the first time with this guy, and succeeded in not letting it rise to the surface. But my idiot self was so amused by the dumb joke I had made in my head that a felt a laugh bubbling up instead. Now, most men don’t really feel so good when a woman laughs in their face right after they’ve gotten undressed, so I was really trying to divert that laugh in whatever way I could and decided to try and let it out as a seductive sigh. But clearly the raging conflict and suppression I was engaged in caught the attention of my sexual partner, and he stopped and said “what?”


My brain was in such a state of disarray that the seductive sigh came out as I answered his question in the most basic terms possible: “Ben Shapiro,” I moaned. His expression was indescribable. Shock, uncertainty, revulsion, all crossed his face in the same split second. We still did the deed but he didn’t finish lmao.  I feel like even if I tried to explain myself, there’s no fixing it. Haven’t heard from him since. 

TLDR: brain wanted me to make a Ben Shapiro joke during sex, accidentally moaned his name instead

Holy shit this blew up. Just gonna address a couple points 

- this happened mid coitus. After the momentary pause he went back to business. I was kinda frozen up by what occurred and by the time I regained my sense it seemed like I’d be digging my own grave deeper if I brought it back up 

- obviously I know I did pretty much everything wrong I could have done. That’s why it’s in this 
sub and not in r/MyLifeIsAwesome. If I could go back I would change things. Next time I’ll just make the joke lol 

- neither of us has reached out since. I think we’re both happy just pretending it never happened

I’m glad my unfortunate sexual encounter could bring y’all so much joy haha. Makes me feel a bit better about it. Maybe one day I’ll try stand up and incorporate this story into my routine haha"
ihz9aw,TIFU I Choked On Candy While in the Shower,43518,0.92,1240,2020-08-28 08:26:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ihz9aw/tifu_i_choked_on_candy_while_in_the_shower/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ihz9aw/tifu_i_choked_on_candy_while_in_the_shower/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"I (a 18m) fucked up tonight.

It was about time I was going to bed, but I needed to take a shower. Right before I went to the bathroom, I popped a warhead sour candy in my mouth. I went to the bathroom, stripped down and hopped in the shower. just as I put my head up in the shower to rinse my face, the warhead in my mouth slipped back and *got stuck in my throat AND I STARTED CHOKING.* I realized this, and after a few seconds of 'AWGHWAGWHAGWH' I jumped out of the shower and RAN out of the bathroom, to my parents room, the only place where people are that could help me. I BARGED into their room, cheeks out, balls-a-dangling, and continued my 'AWAGWGHAWGAHW' noises. Their initial reaction is what you would expect for you to run in buck naked in front of your parents. Then, they realized I was choking, and my dad jumped out of bed, grabbed me and proceeded to do the Heimlich maneuver on me. That hurt like hell, I'll tell you that. after a few reps, the warhead in my throat shot out and landed on the carpet. I collapsed on the ground, soaking wet, legs splayed with His Majesty in full view. I then realized what just happened and I, AN 18 YEAR OLD DUDE, am lying naked in front of my VERY CONCERNED STARING parents. I grabbed the candy, which was lying next to me, shouted a thank you, and BOOKED IT back to the bathroom.

I haven't seen either of my parents since, I would like to book a 3am flight to Alaska, if anybody can do that for me HMU

TL;DR I choked on candy while in the shower, and my parents had to do the Heimlich maneuver on my naked self."

Edit: Wow. Ok. First, thanks for the gold and the silver. My most popular post ever is about me being a moron. Good feeling. Yes, I will never be looking at my phone without sitting or lying down again.

Second: for those claiming I'm lying because I haven't answered, I'm Australian dudes. I posted this at 11pm and then went to sleep. I'm in the hospital. Calm the farm. For those who require it though: Broken Leg https://imgur.com/gallery/ur4ietO

Third: the language I was working on was German. I'm aware of the limitations of Duolingo, but I find it fun. And I'm pretty addicted to the whole streak thing

Fourth: yes. I'm an idiot. That's why I posted in TIFU. Right now I'm in pain and I thought someone might be able to get some enjoyment out of that because of the absolutely stupid reason.

_____________________________________________________________
This just happened today, on mobile so please forgive any typos. Including the one in the title. Should be Duolingo

So this morning was like any other Tuesday morning. I woke up at 7 ready to head into work for my favourite work day of the week. I was gonna learn some new stuff and sit at a desk, not having to interact with customers at all. 

I get dressed and head out into our stairwell, not bothering to turn on the lights as I head towards the bottom floor and the garage. As I'm heading down, I figured it was a great time to pull out Duolingo. Gotta keep up with my streak and all that. 

As I'm completing the lessons, I'm getting towards the dark bit of the stairs. Not noticing or looking where I am going at all, I put out my foot for the next stair and suddenly, I fall. 

There is a massive crack as my foot hits the floor at a bizarre angle and I let out a scream. I reach down and touch my leg and notice that my shin should not be bulging like that and scream again, this time with more panic. I can't move the leg, it hurts too much. I crawl my way over to the phone and notice Duolingo still open. Naturally the first thought in my head is, 'well, this needs to be closed' before I called my husband for help and some crutches. As I'm waiting for him I look down at my phone. Sure, I'm in immense pain... But those daily lessons... 

I stabilise my knee and promptly reopen the app. And there I am, waiting for crutches, sitting at the bottom of a stairwell, with my leg and ankle bent in two places in a way those parts were very much not supposed to bend, finishing the very lessons that caused me to fall in the first place. 
That was 16 hours ago. I am now lying in a hospital bed, unable to sleep, with my broken leg in a plaster cast - and yet still the haunting ""Hoooo"" of that owl calls to me.

TL;DR: I fucked up by keeping up with Duolingo and ended up breaking my leg."

Just a few minutes ago, in fact.

A bit of context: I got banned from tinder a few years ago for selling feet pics (oops) but was recently single and wanted to get back in the game. After deciding other dating apps were a little too wholesome for me,
I decided to go for Tinder. I needed a phone number that wasn’t blocked, so I used my mom’s and then called her and got the code. I figured, she’s like 60 and probably doesn’t even know what a dating app is, so no harm, no foul right?

Today we’re all sitting at the table getting ready to eat breakfast and my step dad comes out and sits down. He’s calm as can be as he butters his toast. He glances up from his paper and says to all of us, “I am packing my things and leaving this afternoon.”

I almost spit out my orange juice. My brothers start crying. Mom is sputtering, trying to figure out what is going on. She keeps asking why, and he pulls out a literal printed page from the google search results of “what is tinder”. He hands it to my mom. She doesn’t even know what is going on at this point, she doesn’t remember giving me the code months ago. 

I grab the paper from her and read it, and realize where I fucked up. I turn to my step dad and let him know, frantically, that it was me. He asks why in the world I would need to use her phone to make the account. I scroll through my phone, find an album of different angles of my FEET, and explain to him. He was thoroughly disgusted, and went back to their room through almost tears of laughter. I don’t think he’s still leaving but my family will never look at my the same again.


TL:DR: tried to sell feet pics, got banned from tinder, used my moms phone, danger is afoot"

One of my co-workers came to my desk and asked me if I was aware of what my picture was on whatsapp. I use whatsapp very rarely, mostly with friends if we are not using other apps available i.e. Snapchat. I had to check as I had not been on whatsapp in a while. So I open whatsapp to check my picture and felt like throwing up.

So the story behind my whatsapp profile picture is that I saw it on Twitter, showed it to my friends because I thought it was hilarious. One of them said I wouldn't set it at my profile picture, and I said bet. So I set it on an app I never use and completely forgot about it. The picture is a very detailed and pornographic image of Iron Man and Captain America having sex. Picture Attached: [WhatsApp Picture (NSFW)](https://imgur.com/a/MzTNCpr)

Once I saw it, I immediately changed it to the most professional picture of me I could find. As I'm panicking and not knowing what to do, wanting to change my identity - a co-worker comes up to me who usually chats with me and is very friendly with me could not even look me in the eyes. My boss saw this picture, all my co-workers saw this picture, I feel like I have scarred these older people for life.

Tomorrow I have to go back to work and I don't know what to expect or what to do.

TL;DR

My co-workers saw a pornographic image which was set as my profile picture on whatsapp.

ctjxea,TIFU by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.,43331,0.83,1296,2019-08-21 22:50:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ctjxea/tifu_by_not_removing_my_girlfriends_phone_from_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ctjxea/tifu_by_not_removing_my_girlfriends_phone_from_my/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. 

So backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn’t want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren’t virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. 

She was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I’d see her again. 

One time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn’t even 

Things went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn’t find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend’s expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

Turns out that she hadn’t clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone “daddy” who was definitely not her dad (the mother’s words, not mine).  

She told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
My girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn’t. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying “how could she do this” and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. 

So we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn’t get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise “I’m home for the weekend”. She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

We got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. 

When I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how “we won’t do it again” and how “we’re just stupid teenagers” and most importantly how I was gonna “rebuild their trust”. Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

At the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn’t want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it’s still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

TLDR: My girlfriend and I took phone sex to a whole other level.

Edit: holy fuck you guys I went to class and come out and this is what I see???? Thank you so much for the gold stranger. My first gold!"

I had been seeing this girl for a couple of weeks, pretty casual but she was really fun and funny, if not a bit intense. After a few weeks she starts referring to me as her boyfriend and talking about meet her parents, I’m not feeling it but being a douche-y 21 year old I go with it cause she is having sex with me (!!!). So it all comes to a head one night when she pulls me into a room off of her bedroom (insert John Mulaney bit here). Laid out on the floor are dozens if not hundreds of pictures of her. And I’m not talking about sexy pictures (which would still be weird) but regular pictures of her. Pictures with her family, her friends from high school, definitely at least one Christmas card with her whole-ass family on it. She than proceeds to ask me to have sex with her right there. Shit was creepy so I left real fast after I finished. After regaling some friends with that bizarre tale (they were pretty sure she was cursing me or stealing my soul) I cut it off with her and she proceeded to come by my work daily, for hours and stare at me. That went on for a couple of months before we banned her. After that she would send me messages on Facebook about how we were meant to be together and how much she loved me. I’d get a message every couple of months before I eventually blocked her. Haven’t seen or heard from her in years thank god.

TLDR: Had sex with a girl on top of a bunch of pictures of her, she proceeds to stalk me for half a year"

I’ve recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. My reddit is COVERED in dogs from various sources. My Facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. Basically everywhere I turn, I see dog. Not a bad life to live. Until yesterday (YIFU I know). I walked one of my mother’s friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. It wasn’t very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. It’s hot. I’ve just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. I want to blame dehydration for this FU, but really I know I’m just an idiot. A couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. My first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. I don’t know. It’s a hot day and I’ve seen dogs in pushchairs before. Maybe they didn’t want its paws on hot tarmac. Maybe they’re just a little extra. Regardless, the thought that babies exist didn’t enter my tiny stupid brain. As they got up to leave and walk by me, I decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words “What breed is it?” and gestured towards the pushchair. They looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. It was a baby. A HUMAN baby. I’m so glad they took the traditional British approach of confused stare and silence. If they had said something I think I would have disintegrated on the spot. It was a long walk home after that and thankfully, I didn’t pass anymore pushchairs. 

TL;DR I asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the Internet."

That said, we’ve been together since high school, so we both feel that we missed out a little by being each others’ only sexual experiences. We’ve talked about this at length and decided a few years ago that we’re ok with having a few hall passes in our relationship, since we very much intend to stay together the rest of our lives and don’t want any resentment over missed possibilites. Plus it’s pretty rare that we could even find such an opportunity, as it’s a little hard to find hookups when you’re in a committed marriage and don’t go out much. We even gave each other advance approval in case a situation arises, so long as we’re safe about it and tell each other immediately afterward. We’ve both used one HP, each with someone we knew well enough but would never see again, and no issues came out of it. In fact, it’s only made us more secure in our relationship and how much we genuinely appreciate being with each other.

Recently, I had to travel to London for work. I don’t normally get to travel for work, so I decided to make a trip out of it and spend a few extra days of my own time in the city after the project was done. My wife couldn’t join because she didn’t have any vacation time left but was very supportive of me taking some time to explore since I’ve never been to London and she has. Being cheap, and being a pretty outgoing guy when I’m so inclined, I decided to stay in a hostel. I was interested in meeting other travelers since I didn’t know anyone in the city and love being sociable with new people. I chatted with several of the people staying there, and in particular a very attractive French girl (mid-20’s) who dressed super goth.

For context, I love the goth girl look. I’ve been sucked into the goth gf propaganda online, much to the annoyance of my wife. It isn’t her style, but she has been nice enough to cater to me by putting on a sexy goth outfit on occasion, since she’s knows it’s a huge fantasy of mine. Still, I pester her constantly to be more goth because I enjoy it so much. 

Anyway, I ended up spending a little bit of time with goth French baddie - we both went to the hostel’s happy hour event and hit it off there. I found out that she was recently single and was in London for an art show. It turned out we were both into emo music, and we talked about our favorite bands. I had the thought that she was acting a bit flirty towards me, but didn’t think too much of it, until I later found myself sharing a sink with her in the hostel bathroom. 

The hostel was co-ed, so each floor had a small shared bathroom with a communal sink, and a door that was meant to be kept open but which people frequently closed for the sake of having more privacy than just a stall to shower in. So I’m brushing my teeth while chatting up the real-life version of Shadowheart (who, mind you, is wearing an extremely low cut top), when she suddenly closes the bathroom door behind us. In my mind, my wildest fantasy is about to come true. It’s even more exciting because of the adrenaline rush of being in a semi-public setting, and a girl being so into me that she would make such a bold move. I can’t believe this is actually happening to me. I instantly get hard. Then she turns around and asks “Are you interested in learning about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?”

She had me cornered for 10 minutes trying to talk me into salvation, while I grew increasingly despondent and immensely disappointed, with the whiplash of going from what could’ve been one of the crowning moments of my life, to pure and utter dejection.

When I told my wife this story, she laughed for a solid hour. She said it’s karma for annoying her about wanting a goth gf. 

TL;DR life dream was to bang a hot goth girl. Thought I was getting the opportunity, but got cockblocked by Jesus Christ. god is real and he hates me.

A friend of mine, “Jenny” shows us a picture of her father so I pull up Facebook images of my mother and father. A friend of mine saw my father and said I looked just like him but when he saw my mother the color in his face drained.

“Chad” watched me scroll down my picture of my mon then asked about my siblings. He described them in detail, PERFECT DETAIL!!! He then said to me, “Lilly, I think I fucked your mom.” I laughed of course, Chad has a reputation and I figured it was a joke until he described my siblings, my mothers home, the neighborhood and ect. 

I felt horror. Sheer horror. He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him! Just a few days ago he was flirting with me and what not! And now I find out, he’s a motherfucker! Literally a motherfucker!


TLDR; college friend fucked by mom, described her and my family in detail, and had been trying to put the moves on my days prior without realizing I was her daughter. MOTHERFUCKER!


Edit: To clarify some more things, apparently he found her through a hook up ad. She had someone watching my siblings while she took him to the bone zone… so the bed I’ve sat on has mom and Chad juices on them. He asked me to call him daddy now. I feel homicidal.

Edit 2: my parents haven’t been together for as long as I’ve been alive. My Mom has not had a long lasting relationship through out my life and I kind of blame myself for that. I say this because I was never an easy kid. I was bitter and sad and no one wants a woman with a child that doesn’t receive the necessary mental help to thrive. My mom and I also don’t have the best relationship either. I always felt she was a bit envious of me do to the fact that I’ve been able to maintain a relationship longer than she has at my young age. While I’m a bit frazzled at the prospect of my friend doing my mom I guess I can’t be mad at him because he genuinely didn’t know. A little ways down the road we’ll both laugh at this. My Giga Chad sigma male friend will not end up sleeping with me tho because I am deeply into someone else. My partner said I should fuck his mom tho to assert my dominance.

Update: fucked his dad. I’d been plotting hard and I did it. I fucked his dad. His dad fucked me on Chads childhood blanket."

So I was being a trash goblin last night and staying up into the wee hours to eat easter candy and play video games, which I don't do that often.  Anyway, does anyone else enjoy robins eggs? Those neon colored malted milk ball eggs they sell this time of year? Well, as a kid I used to do this stupid thing where I would lick them and smear the color all over my lips because hey, free lipstick! Do not ask what compelled me to do this, but i did this last night with a blue one. Then of course because I am a trash goblin i forgot all about it, fell asleep slack jawed upright on the couch with the lights on and TV still going. Next thing I know theres shouting, panicking sounds, and I'm being shaken violently, and by the time I come to I see my husband fumbling with his phone? I kind of... flapped my arms angrilly and said something like ""whazwrongwitchyou?!"" Yeah, he had been about to call 911 because he just walked out on his wife passed out with blue lips, he thought I was choking. He was pretty incensed when I told him it was candy, it's the dumbest thing I've ever had to explain in our whole marriage.

TL;DR: I accidentally did a candy coated immitation of the recently deceased causing my husband a panic attack and a near summoning of an ambulence.

EDIT- Didn't expect this to be so popular, thanks for the awards, and the discussions on different candy eating rituals! My husband has steadied his nerves and is now just ribbing me mercilessly- not just for scaring him senseless, but also because I've been training for a triathalon and eating really healthily, so this lapse was extra grotesque."

Happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

My gf and I were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. Awful game by the way. Anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. The gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

The star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

As she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

Which she immediately did.

I have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and I've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. Nor have I ever been so afraid. She ended the game with 0 stars...

""I will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

The rest of the game was spent in dread. Its now 3am and I'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

Goodbye.

Tl;dr Mario Party 7 is a terrible game."
ljqhty,TIFU by getting the exchange rate wrong and spending $800 on a bottle of wine,42816,0.91,1891,2021-02-14 21:03:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ljqhty/tifu_by_getting_the_exchange_rate_wrong_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ljqhty/tifu_by_getting_the_exchange_rate_wrong_and/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So I’ve been living in Japan for almost two years now and have been seeing a girl for about six months. Today being Valentine’s Day, I made reservations for a course meal at a hotel restaurant.

Admittedly, it’s not my usual style; I’m perfectly happy going to cheap izakayas and that kind of thing, but variety is the spice of life and we both decided it would be nice to dress up a little and have a fancy meal.

Two course meals were already going to set me back a pretty penny, but the fuck up was when it came time to order drinks. As befits a romantic dinner, we decided on a bottle of wine. I have long since decided not to pretend to be a wine expert and to just ask the servers for their recommendation when it comes to this kind of thing. Our waiter went for the drink menu, came back with a tablet, and made a few suggestions, all around the ¥16,000 ($160) price range. Of course I tried not to let it show, but I thought that was a bit on the expensive side and swiped to an $80 alternative. I asked him if it’s a good wine.

“Oh, that’s a very good wine, sir.”

I told him we’d go with that one, and he politely took the order and left. My girlfriend spent the next 10 minutes or so joking about the wine ordering process, and I thought she was making fun of me for going with a cheaper wine. Fair enough.

The wine was served to us and we both agreed it was really good.

She kept going with the joking, though, and it was when she said that she hoped that it was 80,000 yen and not 80,000 dollars that it finally hit me. Somehow, even after living here for as long as I have, my brain misfired and I equated 80,000 yen with $80 when it’s actually more like $800.

By that point, we were well into the bottle and there was no going back.

Needless to say, that was a shocker, but I did my best to take it in stride and just enjoy it. She was pretty cool about it too, laughing about it but also showing concern about the (for us) outrageous price. I’m fortunate enough to not have to worry about it, and I’m thankful for that, but my bank account definitely took a hit tonight. I had to mentally prepare myself for when the bill arrived.

Anyway, as I told her, we’ll just be drinking tap water for the next 10 Valentine’s Days.

TL;DR - During Valentine’s dinner, messed up the yen-dollar exchange rate in my head and ordered a $800 wine at a restaurant instead of an $80 one.


Edit: Well this gained traction while I was sleeping. Here’s the bottle for those asking, complete with wine dribbles on the tablecloth:

So spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
The googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. After a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

Skip forward to this Tuesday;
I do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and I was submerged under water, after I emerged and pulled my boat out I could hear a slight rattle in my ear and I knew instantly what it was.
It's now Friday and the rattling happens every time I turn my head and I still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

TLDR: Put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... It didn't

UPTATE:
So this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause I think it's abit mental aswell.

However I'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and I'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

Alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and I can honestly say I don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think they're as big of thing in the UK.

o71q1i,TIFU; Replaced my toilet figured out why my ass was never clean.,42669,0.77,3784,2021-06-24 19:43:55,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o71q1i/tifu_replaced_my_toilet_figured_out_why_my_ass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/o71q1i/tifu_replaced_my_toilet_figured_out_why_my_ass/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,True,,False,"Just happened.  So yes, today.  But not so sure it's a FU.  Maybe realization that I've been FUping for like 4 years?  So bit of context.  I'm a bit of a bigger guy.  6'2"" and a fairly huge ass.  We moved into our new house 4 years ago and the place has these teeny little doll toilets.  They are usable but you have to sit with your knees around your ears.  Meh... maybe the place used to be owned by hobbits or something?

For the last 4 years every time I take a shit it turns into a ""crayon"" experience.  You know... you wipe and wipe and wipe and every time the TP comes out with a brown streak like you are wiping the end of a crayon.  When I think I've finally got things clean I head out for a walk.  Half a block later I've got this burning down there and a sticky feeling and when I get home sure enough a chunk of shit has worked it's way down into my ass crack and made a sticky mess between my cheeks and maybe into my under ware.

Did I mention this has been going on for FOUR YEARS?  Several times I've thought of seeing a doctor and maybe it's some kind of colon cancer or who knows what.  Like not enough to really do anything about it... but a worry none the less.

So a week or two back our toilet started doing a little mini-flush every few hours.  Annoying.  The valve inside it was leaking.  Some investigation and it turns out this little doll toilet has a strange flush by wire sort of thing and a complicated two stage flusher.  Home Depot has a replacement but it's $81.  And I hate this thing anyway.  So rather than pour good money after bad I headed over to Costco and pick up a new toilet.

Changing the toilet on my own was a real challenge.  Those things are heavy.  I got very sweaty, took off my shirt, hauled the old one out to the garage, got the old icky brown wax ring all over my hands and headed back towards the house.  Meanwhile the nice young Christian lady next door pulled up and said ""Hey!""  Being super sweaty, no shirt, puffing like a hog, I held up a brown apparently shit covered hand and said ""I've got some toilet issues!"".  She looked horrified and quickly closed her garage door.  FML.

Today the toilet is installed and I decided to christen it with an inaugural shit.  Life changing.  I finally discovered my 4 year's of FU.  With my knees down at the normal position and the bowl much much larger it can now accommodate my entire ass.  The shit came flinging out like it should.  (Edit for clarity:  The old tiny hobbit bowl toilet was apparently squeezing my ass cheeks together preventing a full release of my poo - thus the Crayon effect).

Better still, the larger bowl can now accommodate not only my gigantic ass but also my hand can now reach all the way up into my ass crack!  I can finally properly clean my poo hole.  Couple swipes and no more crayon!  I'm CLEAN!  I almost felt like running next door to tell the neighbor about my triumph but ya... think I've freaked her out enough for one week.

Edit:  Well this sure blew up beyond all measure.  Thanks for the over 10K upvotes (and counting!).  The ""helpful"" and ""wholesome"" awards made me laugh but thanks so much for all your kind awards.  Many helpful hints on how to sit on a toilet, how to spread ass cheeks and all the rest - much appreciated.  I will also strongly consider your suggestions for a bidet.  I've always thought they were sort of gross... but reading over what I just posted... ya... not so gross.    Even the negative comments made me laugh.  Thanks all!  You guys are hilariously the best. 

TLDR; I spent 4 years shitting in a toilet that was made for hobbits."

In an effort to make things less boring, we played “two truths and a lie.” I gave the kids my example, which was: “I have two brothers. I’m from Texas. I love horror movies.” Unfortunately, I messed up my own directions and gave them two lies—the brothers and horror movies.

For inexplicable reasons, I just...rolled with it, only corrected the brothers thing, and the kids were delighted at my “cool hobby.” Now I have kids excitedly emailing me to ask about my favorite horror movies, and they’ve promised to make me some really fun artwork based on our (presumed) shared love of this genre. Apparently a middle-aged, mom-type teacher who loves horror movies is some kind of unicorn to them, and I don’t have the heart to correct them. 

I feel my only option moving forward is to just embrace the lie. To get started, I watched a shitty (yet still scary to me) horror movie on Netflix after school. Now Netflix is suggesting other horror movies which I’m afraid of based on the title and font alone, and I guess I’ll never sleep again.

TL;DR: Lied to children; must quickly become an expert in a genre of movies I truly hate.

EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions! I have a long list of movies get through now. I may end up writing this story for my students (and thus coming clean) when we study personal narratives later this year. Also, thanks for the awards!"
6zpf6k,TIFU by buying a used PlayStation 2 on Letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.,42657,0.87,2583,2017-09-13 01:22:16,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6zpf6k/tifu_by_buying_a_used_playstation_2_on_letgo_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6zpf6k/tifu_by_buying_a_used_playstation_2_on_letgo_that/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.


*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.


TL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

Edit: Hi, Reddit! I just wanted to say many thanks for the gold AND all the offers for cockroach-free PlayStations!  warms my heart, and I'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. Happy Redditing!"

Understanding I'd now need to shut myself in for at least two weeks, I set about getting a few supplies. Near enough everything was completely sold out online, however, I managed to find an amazon listing for 40pcks of ramen. Couldn't believe my luck! All were sold out bar the spicy chicken flavour. Not a problem - I like a bit of spice. Without reading the ad, I purchased immediately using the buy now button, thinking I'd found the listing just in time...

It arrived a few days later and I eagerly grabbed a pack. I noticed it read 2x spicy on the front. No worries, as a Brit, a hot curry and a pint is pretty much a weekly occurrence from birth. I excitedly cook my first batch. Pouring the included sauce on I notice it's blood red, thick and viscous. Once mixed In though it looks OK. The noodles smell great. Oniony, chickeny tomato like smell. Right up my street. 

I took my first mouthful and messily slurped up the noods, getting the sauce all over my lips. It tasted pretty g- OH MY GOD WTF THE PAIN!!???

It was IMMEDIATELY screaming hot. Intense heat within 2 seconds flat. I coughed, inhaling some of the oily sauce and having it stick to the back of my throat, making me cough more and more. I ran for the milk, which offered me only temporary relief. I suffered through and finished the bowl. By the end, I was crying, sweating, pouring out from my nose and had turned a lovely shade of red. I had a Google of the brand and it turned out these are the hottest ramen available on the market. A limited ""nuclear fire"" edition release with double the spice of their already extremely spicy ""fire"" ramen. Just the originals are so hot that it's become a trend online to film yourself attempt to eat a single pack. I now have 39 more packs of the twice as hot kind to get through.

I refuse to let these go to waste. I'm 5 packs in so far, each pack literally makes me cry. I sincerely regret panic buying. Let this be a lesson for anyone. Just shop normally and read things before buying them. Don't be a twat like me.

Tldr: panic bought the hottest instant ramen on the planet in bulk without reading the product description. Now suffering greatly for my stupidity. 35 packs of suffering left.

Ps. My sister had a common cold, nothing to worry about. :)

Edit: the noodles are samyang 2x spicy fire chicken ramyun. Alternatively, Google ""worlds spiciest ramen""

Edit2: Please, get out of my dm's. I will NOT send noods.

Edit3: Wow, apparently saying as a Brit I can handle spice makes about as much sense as saying as a fish I can handle dry land. Apologies for triggering the spicelords...

Edit4: So you're saying ketchup ISN'T spicy????

Edit5: I have started to piss streams of fire. Genuinely painful burning sensation up through the inside and tip of my wingly wangler. Who'd have thought that was a thing??"

I keep telling her bedrock doesn't do mods and she always replies with ""well buy me a computer"".  

Well two weeks ago we were talking about her gym class she goes to where they do fun physical fitness stuff for kids. Its at a real gym with real gym instructors. She said they did a plank for 30 seconds as part of her class. And I (stupidly) said if you can beat my plank time id buy her a computer. Now my time is 2.25. And my wifes is around 3.15. 

So the gym instructor asked all the kids what their goals are this year. Just a general life thing not related specifically to physical fitness. Some said stuff like ""read more"" or ""finish X game"" etc. my kid says ""To do a 4 minute plank"".  Well the instructor suddenly had something he could work with. So he said ""ok lets do that!"". 

In my kids bravado she had forgotten the original bet was 2.26 or better. In doing so she overshot it by a fair way and made it considerably harder for herself

By the end she was a sweaty crying mess, her form had gone to hell but it was definitely still a plank. The instructor yelled 4 minutes and she said ""can i stop now?"" between tears and heavy breathing. She stopped at 4.08. 

Anyway, whats a good mid level graphics card for Minecraft with some shaders?

TL;DR Made a stupid bet with my kid about buying her a PC if she beat my plank time. I lost and am now poor.

Everyone else was gone at this point. My teacher is a G so he lets us play dodgeball during study hall from time to time. He figured I was really tired so he didn’t wake me up for it. 

Eventually they all came back, and saw me with my head on the desk and a puddle of blood forming around it. They all started freaking out, and all the commotion woke me up. So then I sat up and I was like, “huh?”

This happened in 2008, shortly after I got stationed in South Korea (Republic of Korea, officially.) 

I was a lowly private, albeit a reasonably attractive woman in my early twenties. I was out one night with some friends, when a tall, funny redhead guy, who happened to be one of my friend's soldiers, asked to take me out to dinner. 

Friend told me it was a bad idea. I asked why, but he wouldn't give me details. My exact words were ""what's the worst that could happen, I get a free meal and we don't click?"" 

As you may have guessed, this was not, in fact, the worst that could happen. 

The following evening, we were supposed to meet at the taxi stand outside post, but he was late. He calls to tell me he's at the ATM and ask if I have cash for the taxi. Not a great start, but, sure, I can spring for the taxi. 

He gets to the taxi stand, we ask the Korean taxi driver, in our mash of Korean and English, to take us to the nearby Air Force base, which houses the only Chili's on the peninsula. Something to the effect of ""Adishe, Osan ka-ju-sai-oh"" (Sir, take us to Osan, please.)

We're going through back roads, and I ask what he thinks of Korea so far. He starts going off on a rant about how ""these people don't even speak English"" and I must have looked at him like he had lost his mind. As I open my mouth to speak,  a little boy loses his ball and runs into the street to get it. This set Red off all over again, talking about ""these people have no common sense!"" and just really racist, weird and out of touch comments. 

When he finally takes a breath, I remind him that we're in their country, not the other way around, and that everyone's been really respectful, so I'm not sure what his problem was in the first place. He gets mad, and puts his headphones on, not saying another word to me the whole way to Osan. 

When we finally pull up to Osan Air Force Base, I lean forward to pay the driver, and he says, in perfect English with an American accent ""thank you, ma'am, that will be X amount of wan."" and I could feel the blood rush to my face. Red does a double take at this man's English and darts out of the cab. I apologize profusely, and the driver reminds me he speaks English, tells me he spent ten years in Chicago, and that he knows I wasn't the one being awful. I tipped him as well as I could, thanked him, and apologized again. 

We had to take another, shorter taxi ride once on base to the Chili's. Red remained silent, and, not surprisingly, I paid for this one, too. 

Red, who is about 6 ft 2, dressed in baggy, bleach-white shoes, pants, t-shirt and baseball cap, decides to go to the restroom as soon as we're seated. He comes back, immediately and loudly commenting on ""everyone"" staring at him. Trying to lighten the mood, I say that it's strange how clear it is which guys are Army, and which are Air Force. He asks how I can tell, which is almost funny to me, and I use the phrase ""pretty boys"" to describe the AF guys, and say the soldiers all look a little tougher. He starts *yelling* actually *yelling at me* that if I like AF guys so much, I should go out with one of them. I just stared at him

Server comes, I ask for a water- there's no way I want to be drunk around this dude. He insists that the margaritas are the only reason to come to Chili's, and orders one for me. The server is a young woman who looks at me nervously, but I just nod to let her know it's fine. I ordered a Buffalo chicken salad, he orders two appetizers, beer and a steak. 

I had one sip of the margarita, and ""let"" him finish it, on top of the three or four beers he has. He snaps at the server, sends his food back, just everything he could have done. We don't talk much. 

The server brings the check and he says to her ""Oh we'll split it right down the middle"" or something very clearly to the effect of I'm paying 50% of that number. She looks at me again, and I take the check from her. 

I am totally done at this point. 

""Oh, if we're going to split it, let's split it! These beers are yours, the steak was yours, the appetizers are yours... technically the margarita was mine, even though you drank it, but I'll take that and my salad, and you, *sir* can pay for the rest!"" The server is just standing there awkwardly staring as I finally raise my voice at this jerk. He opens his mouth to say something and I snap ""What?! Did I *miss something?!*"" and I hand her cash, as he hands her his card. 

He didn't even tip, but I did. (Off post, tipping is rude, but, frankly, she more than earned it.)

He was totally silent the entire ride back, which, of course, I paid for. 

I let his supervisor/my friend who had warned me know how it went down, and apologized for not heeding the warning. Somehow, at PT the next morning, Red had showed up in the wrong uniform and was smoked quite severely, I heard, but we never spoke again.

EDIT: *Thank you* to everyone who has been kind in the comments. I didn't think my default worst date story would cause this kind of ruckus. 

INFO: I was an Army medic, stationed on Humphreys at the time. *We were briefed that it was considered rude to tip servers in Korea.* At least one person with more personal knowledge than my own on the matter has clarified this in the comments. I was a server before joining, and strongly support people tipping their servers well and often where it is customary/necessary for them to pay their bills."
aa9ej2,TIFU by making myself an uncle NSFW,42591,0.85,2823,2018-12-28 16:34:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aa9ej2/tifu_by_making_myself_an_uncle_nsfw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aa9ej2/tifu_by_making_myself_an_uncle_nsfw/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"So this started 2 weeks ago

I went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. Doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a GF.

 Naturally I start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. I get to teasing him about him not losing his V card, my mom is not liking the conversation. His gf ends up coming over, I stopped the teasing I'm not a monster. So I'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. I tell her not to worry about it I'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

I get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. My argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised Ying and yang I grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. He grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. Saying how a party would be good for him I even offered to go, (I'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, I told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (I know how that sounds). So I finally convinced her she agreed.

So I decide that I need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. I knew my bro was losing it that night. Fast forward to the party, I drop him off so my mom thinks Imma be there. I pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. Bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

Skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. Well holy fuck did I get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. Well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  So now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and I'm becoming an uncle.

TL;DR Convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his V card, he got his gf pregnant. 


Update 1: So she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. So we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. I'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. My brother is getting tested for STI's I was all over him about that. Also thanks for the gold and silver (I have no idea what that does). Thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

Update 2: Everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. My brother does not have any STI's or STD's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,I'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. There are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can DM and I can explain what I did if curious, how I got out, how my life has changed and all. 

Update 3: *in Maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! Mother is crying brother is in shock and the GFs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. Everyone pray for this child. 


Update 4: They are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, I helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. I've started a savings account for him, and my GF and I are going to move into a place with him and his GF to help them out."

A couple of days ago the cows in my village were going absolutely bonkers. Me not being able to sleep and having an exam in the morning had the billion dollar idea to take my most soundproof earplugs and go to sleep. I fell asleep in like 5 minutes. 
I also like to set my ringtone to a very quiet bird noise so I dont wake up scared to death and stressed.
Of course, how I should have foreseen, I didn't hear my alarm and overslept by three fucking hours. 
When I woke up, my exam had been over for an hour.
Now this is not that big of a deal. I just have to get a doctor's note and I can retake it.
So off to the doctor's office I go, trying to fix this mess.
I had to come up with a reason why I couldn't go to my exam today. I told the doctor I had massive ear pain, a headache, and some nausea.
Doctor checked me and I ended up having an infected wisdom tooth. I just didnt notice it somehow. I had some pain here and there but it felt like it was coming out of my tempomandibular joint wich I have had problems with before.
Anyway at least I have my doctors note now. 
First problem fixed.
I chose to get said wisdom tooth pulled because it was crooked anyway and the infection would probably reoccur.
Mom drives me to the dental surgeon. I got drugged up real good.
Tooth pulled, everything went fine.
Got in the car with mom, told her about every time I have done drugs, and about all of the gay sex i have had (she didn't know I was gay). 
Now I am in a shit ton of pain, my mom won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I cant sleep because the cows are going insane again.
TL;DR: tried to bamboozle my doctor into giving me a doctor's note because I overslept my exam, ended up having to get my wisdom tooth pulled and came out to my mother high of off my ass.

EDIT: 1.this did not happen in one day. It was over the course of three days.
2.I will not use the enter button. Ever.
3. Earplugs are pura-fit moldex, work great if inserted properly
4. The drug was Triazolam
5. I barely passed the exam. It was math.
6. Some of the comments will look real stupid now"
kz5loj,TIFU by learning that my toddler made up their own way of swearing at me and has been telling me to f off for a while.,42480,0.88,1546,2021-01-17 17:57:51,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kz5loj/tifu_by_learning_that_my_toddler_made_up_their/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kz5loj/tifu_by_learning_that_my_toddler_made_up_their/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,,False,"So the build up to this fuck up... 

I work out at home and have done since my child was born. I like to work out to music and there is one particular song that for some reason really helps me get in the mood to squat. It's a song that I'd played for some time without question until 4 months ago because it has a few swear words in it.

My child had been listening to the song a lot more because they recently got into dancing to my music, I realised this when they repeated some of the lyrics and I explained to them why sometimes there are words that we don't use and why ect. 

My child is very emotionally in tune and can express themselves very well. So after this conversation they were very alert to any 'naughty' words, so if they hear anyone swear now they will tell them it's not okay. 

Let's fast forward to a few weeks ago, my child is now having a lot of big feelings that are resulting in big tantrums. Tantrums where they start lifting their fingers up and crossing them over into the shape of an X, and then saying 'off mummy, off' while moving this little X made of fingers in my direction. That confused me for a bit I must admit.

Then came the realisation. 

We were sat down eating dinner and I said the dreaded word that every toddler hates - 'no'. That one word started something that let me know how intelligent my toddler really is. My toddler lifted their fingers, crossed them over, stared at me and said 'x off mummy'. I sat there for a minute while it dawned on me. 

I composed myself, and then I asked if 'X' meant something else? My toddler silently nodded while staring at me... I asked what it meant and I was met with 'I can't tell you, it's a naughty word mummy'. This was all the confirmation that I needed but I knew I still had to continue to address this issue. 

I asked if 'X' was the same word from the song. My toddler broke out laughing, smiled at me and said 'yes mummy'. They had been telling me to fuck off in their own very unique way during tantrums for a few weeks now, and I didn't have any idea until it dawned on me that X had another meaning.  

TL;DR Toddler repeated a swear word, and got told not to use swear words. Toddler then created their own swear word in response and had been swearing at me for a few weeks"

Yesterday she came along with a balloon fetish she read something about.
This does not push any boundaries for wither one of us, so we sat down, had a lot of tequila and blew up some balloons. At one point our inner children came to shine and we just bashed each other with them, some occasional tickling, her screaming and one or another balloon popped. I'll spare you further details, since I'm sure you get the idea.

Fast forward to when we were done.

We're not tired yet, so we start up some streaming page and watch a movie. after like 5 minutes there is a blast, like someone hit the side of our building with a car, and again and again. i quickly grabbed my underwear from the floor and put them on while drunkenly moving towards the door to check what the hell is going on. I'm still one room from the entrance, but have a line of sight when the door blasted open and a Special Forces Police Unit team of 6 stormed into our apartment.

well.. i was standing there, in my undies and deaddrunk. my GF naked in the bedroom even more drunk.
I'm doing some occasional artsy craft, and from a sale I got to own about 7 completely disassembled mannequins and baby dolls. For a lack of proper storage they're cutrently spread throughout the apartment. It kinda looks like a cheap horror movie at the moment.

So I was laying there, face down and surrounded by taped babydolls and limbs of mannequins. That for sure does not look good. They put a hood over my head and brought my girlfriend and me to the police station for questioning

apparently someone heard her screaming and the bangs and thought someone was murdered

Well.. I just came home from the police office where I got laughed at for this story and I thought it might give you a good laugh as well.

TL;DR spicing up sexlife with things we found on the internet lead to Special Forces Police Unit kicking in our door

Edit: it seems important to mention that I'm not based in the US

Edit2: yes this happened. i was there when it did. here's the door with one of my babydoll projects in the background: http://imgur.com/gallery/U34z3OG

Edit3: police paid for the door. carpenter will come in on monday

Edit4: the hood was to protect the identity of the Police Unit since they also do a lot of undercover shit"

He drank alcohol for all the time, and at the end he was drunk as fuck (when he is perfectly lucid he acts like a moron, so imagine how he could be a prick when drunk)

At the end of the dinner, after hours passed insulting me and my co-workers, he asked for the fruit and said: ""garçon, we want watermelon and you better hope it tastes good""

I said ok and I brought the watermelon, he tasted it and he said ""it tastes like dick""

After saying that, he assumed an arrogant facial expression and a stupid smile, and I literally lost my ability to be calm and patient

I just wanted to jump on the table and slap him 'till I was out of strength, but I couldn't

The sad thing is that nobody laughed and I lost my job, but I was underpaid anyway.
He lost his mind and he literally shout ""I'm gonna talk to your boss and after that you won't be able to pay for a piece of bread"". I may be unemployed, but I'm happy

TL; DR: I work as a waiter and the city mayor came here for dinner. He acted like a prick for all the time, treating me like a slave. When I brought the fruit to his table he said ""it tastes like dick"" and I answered ""so you ate a dick?"". At the end I lost my job, but at least I have happiness now..."

I was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

We pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

Being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

As I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

As I'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

She then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

The cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

TL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

Edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350"

They ate some hummus first, then put it away (didn't do anything at the same time like some of you freaks suggested) and then had sex. My son's boyfriend (I think they're boyfriends) saw the post and couldn't stop laughing, so told my son (thinking it could be about them) who told me because I think he felt a bit guilty about hiding it.

Other than that, nothing really exciting happened. We had a long awkward talk, I told him I don't really endorse him having sex but he should really use a condom etc.

Now onto the more important thing, hummus. I really like hummus now, I'd never had it before because it just looked kinda disgusting (yellow and sludgy) but I have learnt appearances can be deceiving. It was homemade so I'm going to have to ask for the recipe so I can make some more (I've finished all of it)
Also what are some other good things to dip in it? I've tried the obvious things (carrot, cucumber, breads) and any suggestions would be appreciated. 
A lot of people have recommended Baba Ganoush as well? Is that similar or better than Hummus?


TLDR: My son is actually gay, but also I really like hummus"

I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:

***I have to say when ""Titty Boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

Ooops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

TL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.

EDIT: Just because I didn't make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up. We had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. I'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to TONS of idiots like me. At least I didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

So some background: I'm a college student and due to the current situation I am using Zoom on a regular basis for all of my classes. Typically in my in person classes, I am usually just there and get my work done and leave, I usually just blend in and go under the radar in most classes.

Basically, I have recently been seeing the memes and TikToks of students joining with funny backgrounds, and some are hilarious. So last night, I'm sitting in my room, bored, and decide I want to try some out for fun on my own Zoom call and see which one is the best. Basically, I found the best background to be [this one](https://imagez.tmz.com/image/12/4by3/2020/03/19/1231d07ca52a4a5ca98d72132a0c0e6f_md.jpg) and I'm just having a good time. I am thinking, “who could consciously join their class with something like this with your face and your name on it?” **Mind you, I am under the assumption that this simply stays in one call and goes away.** I am sure you can see the fuck up already.

Fast forward to this morning, I join my literature class for presentation day, and I am not paying any mind to my own screen as I am half asleep and just woke up for this. Suddenly the professor gasps and starts cracking up, as does everyone else, when the professor is like ""[/u/iamnotonaplane](https://www.reddit.com/u/iamnotonaplane/) WTF is that on your screen"", and I am like ""Whats what?"" when I open my own screen and see myself inbetween the legs of the one and only.

Time to drop out.

FML.

My wife, meanwhile, is a person with chronic pains. Her physical therapist had recently sold her a topical pain salve made from all natural resources. On the night in question, my wife had applied the salve to her sore neck hours before I fell asleep with my face cradled there.

This pain salve, as it turns out, is a simple mix of poplar buds and honey. 

I am very allergic to poplar. 

Sedated by the wine and extreme fatigue of a late night, my body slept through the early warning signs. By the time I woke up, I was covered head to toes in hives and struggling to steal gasps of air. My fingers and toes were completely numb. Nothing made sense to me. 

I’m very happy to report that the medications I have on hand curbed the attack, but another hour asleep might have done me in, or at the very least sent me to the ER. 

Wifey threw away the salve. 

God I love her.

TL;DR: Amazing date night with my wife almost ended in fatality when I passed out in a puddle of allergen and nearly experienced my first episode of full-on Anaphylaxis. Wife continues to be amazing woman worthy of love and adoration."

I woke up around  half past six, went out to see that there is absolutely no one at the beach. I quickly ran downstairs, ate a bagle, while putting on my swim trunks. Looking at the clock in my living room I was happy with the amount of time it took for me to get ready and rushed off to the beach. 

Once at the beach I took of my shirt and layed on the sand for a while. All that sun and the gentle rolling of the waves put me to sleep pretty fast. To my surprise I nodded off a fat one, three hours had past since I fell asleep. I was woken up by the screeching of seagulls and yawned while still laying on the sand. When suddenly something wet and mushy landed right in my mouth, yea that's right a seagull shat in my open mouth. 

Four hours and 3 tubes of toothpaste later I can still taste the soury bitterness of the turd. 

TL;DR Yawned at the beach and a seagull shat in my mouth.

Edit: Oh my, didn't expect that this shitty story would blow up like this. Some say that that brings good luck, guess it brought me good karma, also thank you for my first award yay!

Edit 2 lol: For all of you who were wondering if I got a sunburn. The sun here isn't all that strong in the morning, so I got off without a sunburn."
adl8ba,TIFU by swallowing my little sister’s birthday present,41962,0.89,1333,2019-01-08 01:02:13,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/adl8ba/tifu_by_swallowing_my_little_sisters_birthday/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/adl8ba/tifu_by_swallowing_my_little_sisters_birthday/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,,False,"I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn’t bring myself to post this. 

But reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. 

So yesterday was my sister’s birthday (this fu didn’t happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

“Look what mom gave me,” said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

Now, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Looneytoon. My primitive ape brain said “funny joke!”

So I did it.

I think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister’s eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. 

So my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister’s ring. No, I didn’t know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

So brief intermission from my sister’s birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother’s chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

I shat out the ring this morning. 

Happy birthday sis. 

TL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister’s ring because I thought it would be funny. 

EDIT: good fucking god my inbox. Tune in tomorrow morning and I’ll share a picture of the accursed ring

EDIT 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

k6pwy2,TIFU by accidentally quitting smoking.,41925,0.86,1816,2020-12-04 23:27:19,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k6pwy2/tifu_by_accidentally_quitting_smoking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k6pwy2/tifu_by_accidentally_quitting_smoking/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I guess this is more of a positive fuck up, but still a fuck up.

Anyway, I've been smoking (just cigarettes) regularly for a bit over 4 years now. I really like smoking, it relaxes me, clears my head, and I love the taste of different tobaccos. Well, loved.

I don't smoke a lot unless I'm out with friends, which as you can guess it's something that's just not happening during this pandemic. As a result, I've spent the last month or so smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day, which really enhanced my sense of smell.

Well a couple of weeks ago, I've had a terrible sore throat, to the point of not even being able to talk; smoking was out of the question, as it was simply too painful. My cravings were easy to manage, as I already didn't smoke a lot.

Fast forward 10 days, I'm feeling alright again and I finally grab a cigarette. I light it up, inhale... And it tastes like absolute shit. It feels like I've licked clean my ashtray, nothing at all as what I'm used to! The smoke itself that's coming from the cigarette has a barely tolerable smell, I just can't stand it.

So here I am now, almost a week later. I'd really like to smoke, I loved it so much, but it's just so disgusting I can't bring myself to do it. I've tried, but it's just horrible and the taste just seem to get worse. I had no plans to stop smoking anytime soon, this was 100% not intended and I'm actually pretty annoyed by it.

I guess it's good for my health and everything, but I'm probably one of the only idiots in this world that accidentally quit smoking. This whole thing sounds so stupid.

Edit: holy hell somehow this reached r/all I’m getting a lot of comments and while I might not be able to reply to all of you, please know that I’m reading them all. With so many people sharing their positive experiences about quitting and showing support, I’m actually quite happy this happened to me now. I might be pissed off today but I’ll probably be happy about it in the long run. Thank you!

Edit 2: I’ve literally just received the results of my Covid test: I’m negative!!! I saw a lot of you guys were worried since altered taste and sore throat can be Covid symptoms, so I thought I’d update on my test results here. No Covid for me, the cigarettes taste bad for real!

Tl;dr: Had a really bad case of sore throat that forced me to give up cigarettes for 10 day. Now they taste like absolute shit and I'm actually pretty pissed of because I had no intentions of actually quitting."
u9ntst,TIFU telling my parents about my inheritance,41911,0.92,3144,2022-04-23 01:54:02,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u9ntst/tifu_telling_my_parents_about_my_inheritance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u9ntst/tifu_telling_my_parents_about_my_inheritance/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"TLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now they’re gonna sue me. 

[edited to fix spelling / grammar / weird ass sentences I used]

My 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so it’s been difficult to deal with. I’m in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. She’d be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She would’ve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first. 

When she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had a generous amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I did not know that she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired.  She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She left nothing to my parents but as they didn’t know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and I’m very low contact. We are their only two children. 

At the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them I’d continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didn’t know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them I’d be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them it’s my home and it was willed to me. They couldn’t sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time. 

Cue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now we’re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this. 

just some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.

edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. I’ve gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. It’s fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, I’ll be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so I’ll be continuing her business too and I’ll need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I don’t know it’s overwhelming.

edit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didn’t know they’d even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesn’t say anything about them but I’m leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.

Final Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but won’t push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and I’ll give an official update at some point."
l21s75,TIFU: Dismissing bright red blood in my stool for years. (If you're currently experiencing this symptom PLEASE READ),41868,0.96,2558,2021-01-21 21:57:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l21s75/tifu_dismissing_bright_red_blood_in_my_stool_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l21s75/tifu_dismissing_bright_red_blood_in_my_stool_for/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"**My Experience:**

I’ve had small amounts of bright red blood on my stool for years. I had always dismissed this finding because I’m young with a horrible diet.

I have always been taught that black stool is the worrisome stool, as that’s indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas stool that has bright blood just indicates hemorrhoids.

**My logic for dismissing the bright blood on my stool:**

\- I’ve had a diet consisting of high sugar + high fat, processed foods with low fiber in addition to being very inactive causing constipation and straining – So, bleeding from straining just “made sense”. I’m 6’1 @ 225

\- Blood was not consistent-- It came and went.

\- There was not a lot of blood, and when there was it looked like skid marks on the stool (something I thought was “obviously” related to hemorrhoids

\- I’m young (29)

\- Family history of hemorrhoids, so I thought me having hemorrhoids was just part of the family business

\- Lack of education – especially knowledge relating to polyps (an abnormal tissue formation resembling a skin tag in the colon).

**Why I eventually met with a GI specialist:**

The blood in my stool became more of an everyday thing that lasted for a month. From my perspective, that frequency was abnormal.

My GI doctor thought it was more than likely hemorrhoids, but still recommended a colonoscopy because no matter what, blood in stool, especially in young adults, is not normal should ALWAYS be inspected.

**What was found from the colonoscopy:**

A 20mm polyp. To put in perspective, a 10mm polyp is considered big. The polyp was sent to pathology and in a few days I received a call.

**Pathology:**

They discovered that cancer had formed on the polyp. It’s more of a rare cancer (<1% of colon cancers) that is unfortunately a bit more aggressive than the average colon cancer. At this point, I’m had been staged at stage 3a. After getting part of my colon (large intestine) removed and six weeks later, I will now be starting chemotherapy in five days. The doctors do feel I have an 80-90% chance of being cured with chemo’s assistance.

But what’s more interesting about this cancer is that it is most common in younger people (around later 20s-30s).

**The doctors mentioned that they are seeing colon cancer arise more often in young people.**

**TL;DR:** If you have blood in your stool, you more than likely do NOT have colon cancer. But you should get yourself checked by a doctor if you are having this symptom just to make sure there is nothing going on.

Edit- some clarifications: 
-cancer formed on a polyp relating to the length of time it had not been addressed.

-i now have no blood in my stool after the polyp was removed

-the type of cancer I have is adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells

-I've decided to document myself as I progress through chemotherapy for myself, but also to help increase awareness.

 Link to my first video basically restating everything I've stated here. I will additionally answer questions in a video response format to help save time, as it might be more bearable to respond in that manner than time during chemo.

No one involved in this story is a minor. Tl;dr at bottom.

I am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. There are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. We were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iPhone. She was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""What?"" the collective asked.

""There's some dude's DICK here!""

We gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). We laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. We looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. We also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. We couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

Before I turned the setting off, everyone using my family iCloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos I saved to my phone. This got annoying after my mom started questioning things I had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so I turned it off.

Without thinking of the consequences, I asked her if she shared an iCloud account with anyone. She said she shared one with her parents. She got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

I've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. The rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. We sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

The image is burned into all of our minds. I've never met her father but I'm terrified one day I will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and I'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

Tl;dr: Friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, I can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through iCloud, and now none of us are okay.

Edit: Clarifying the tl;dr

Edit 2, electric boogaloo: Why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. Also thanks for the silver

Edit 3, freud enters the chat: Since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* We are all Americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* We are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* It wasn't crying like OH MY GOD WHAT WILL I DO, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""I can't believe this is what just happened""

Edit 4, the (provable) finale: I’m not posting a picture of this man’s penis you nasties"
c4twsv,TIFU almost eating my cousin out in her office,41828,0.74,2944,2019-06-25 00:51:05,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4twsv/tifu_almost_eating_my_cousin_out_in_her_office/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4twsv/tifu_almost_eating_my_cousin_out_in_her_office/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,,False,"(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)

This happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.

So this is a throwaway, I have \*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.

So I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

She is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office ""XXX,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.

Most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

So along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office ""XXX"" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.

So I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!"" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""OMG COUSIN!"" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

I race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.

Yes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i’m going to be honest.  I don’t know.

edit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can’t really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)

• She doesn’t have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• She lives in NYC, it’s big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn’t occur to me, I guess I was worked up.

• I come here often, it’s not that I didn’t call her, but sometimes when i’m here she’ll dm or comment on my insta story and say “hey come by and visit next time”

• In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don’t know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• We didn’t actually say “hey cousin” lol, i’m just censoring our names for the post.

• Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• I’m 35, she’s 26.

• I deleted my account after freaking out, but I’m sure I’ll post again and I’ll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

I decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn’t fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn’t buy the “i just popped in”.  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn’t, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it’s a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we’ll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - Post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin."

Eventually I just give in and watch them with her on her phone. (Some of them are actually decent)

One started as a prank video between a husband and wife. The mildly attractive wife in the tiktok made up a story about her normal spa being closed and she needed her husband to wax her booty hole. And that completely grossed the husband out. 

My wife then looks up at me and jokingly asks, “Would you shave my butthole?” 

Without thinking or missing a beat I respond, “No, but I would shave her butthole.” 

Instant regret flooded my whole body. I didn’t mean it but I knew that didn’t matter. She turned bright red with tears in her eyes and stormed off. Then I said the least likely sentences I ever thought I would utter to my wife as an apology. “Baby, come back. I didn’t mean it. I would love to shave your butthole.”

She has not talked to me in 3 hours. 

TL;DR - TIFU by telling my wife I would shave some random woman’s turd cutter on tiktok before I would shave hers.

Edit - We eventually made up and I even showed her this post and we had a good laugh. Some solid advice in the comments lol. For those looking for the tiktok, its from Billy and Brandy and should be easy to find."

&#x200B;

I had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but I still swiped out of boredom. They were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything.

&#x200B;

After driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I'm in a shitty ghetto town that I've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I'm getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

The husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don't do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn't care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I'll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

I take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain't she so fuckin wet?"" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn't help I was wearing a condom but I'm extremely glad I was. The entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?""

I decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn't going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left.

I BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm really glad I was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, I'm laughing with you. A lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. I hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness."

My wife broke her phone over the weekend, so we got her a new one. After it came in yesterday, she used my phone to log onto her Google account to so something, sets her phone up and gives mine back to me. I'm playing Dark Souls 2, not thinking much about it. She goes to bed, I stay up gaming for a while.

The next morning, a guy in our fantasy football chat posts an image of his Squirtle evolving. Somewhere in the back of my head, I seemed to remember a Riley Reid/Squirtle ""Fuck I'm gonna evolve"" meme, so searched for it. Google thinks I meant Riley Reid Squirt"" of course, so I'm instead greeted by pics of Riley violently blasting cum everywhere, so move on with my morning.

My wife walks into my computer room and says ""I think my phones been hacked, there's someone searching stuff that isn't me"". She shows me her phone, and all the previous search history pops up:

Riley Reid Squirtle Riley Reid Squirt find Darklurker farm giant souls

As a 36 year old man, worse than being caught with porn is having to prove to your wife that you were actually searching Pokémon memes, believe me.

Also shout-out u/hepatitisC for the perfect meme (which didn't exist at the time)

tl;dr Wife was logged into my phone, tried to find Riley Reid Squirtle meme, got caught being porn and/or Pokemon fan

EDIT: Just to clarify, she was only very confused as to why these searches were on her phone, not angry that I was responsible for them. Trust me, much easier to explain ""oh I was looking for porn"" than ""oh I was looking for Squirtle with this specific woman's face cumvolving because Cody's, a 32 year old man, Squirtle evolved this morning."""

I was fresh out of high school (18F), and in desperate need of some funds. I already had a job that I didn’t make enough money doing, and I needed cash fast. 

Naturally I became a prostitute. 

I’m not one anymore but I used to average about 5 clients a week, and it was really good money. I actually ended up enjoying the job immensely. 

One night I had a brand new client (35M) contact me and ask to meet up. I texted him my address and got ready. 

When he came over, i asked him what he wanted and how he liked it, all the usual questions. I started to undress him and make him comfortable, and soon enough I was on top, riding him. 

We started to a bit rougher when all of a sudden there was a sharp extreme pain in my pelvis. I could barely breathe from the intensity of the pain. He asked if I was alright, and like straight out of a movie with the timing, I looked straight at him and just threw up all over him. 

He pushed me off and was naturally very alarmed as I kept throwing up. The sheets, both of our clothes (and his very expensive leather jacket), and the area was just covered. He immediately asked if he should call an ambulance and all I could do was nod as I moaned in pain and kept throwing up. 

Eventually I went to the hospital that night to find out that I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured. I was in the hospital for a week after surgery, being watched and on medication before I was able to go home. 

He ended up texting me later on asking if I was alright. I apologized for everything, and told him that of course I would pay for the damage to his jacket and he didn’t have to send me anything. 

He was such a sweetheart he still paid me, and he actually asked me out on a date which I said yes to. We don’t talk anymore but I’m very grateful for him. 

TLDR; I was a prostitute and threw up all over my client in the middle of sex. Ended up in the hospital with a ruptured cyst."

This is a project I've been working on for the past week, but the FU only became apparent yesterday.

The characters in this story are:
1. Me, father to a 16-month-old
2. My wife, mother to the same 16-month-old
3. Our 16-month-old

For the past couple of months, Kiddo has been saying ""Dada"" and ""Da"" quite a lot to refer to me. He says it when I walk into the room. He says it when he hears my car pull into the driveway. He says it when he wants my attention. A dozen times a day at least. Let me tell you, there are few pleasures in the world as great as coming home from work and having a toddler look at you and exclaim ""Da!"" with a huge grin on his face.

Now, he's said ""Mama"" and ""Ma"" before to refer to his mom, but it's rare. I know she wishes he would more, and I want her to get that feeling as much as I do, so I decided that I was going to work with Kiddo on saying ""Mama.""

In my 16 months of parenthood, I've learned that my kid picks up skills ok from watching and listening, but that they stick best when he learns by doing. With this in mind, I've been trying to get him to say ""Mama"" on his own accord. He has already demonstrated in the past that he knows his mom's name is ""Mama,"" so I've been working with that. Whenever she walks into view, I'll excitedly say ""who's that?"" He basically never says that it's ""Mama,"" but he does run over and give her a hug. At least there's that, I guess.

After a week of no progress, Kiddo came running into the kitchen yesterday morning, looked right at his mom, gave a big smile, and said, ""who's that?""  Ouch.

Maybe he learns better by listening after all. 

TL;DR - My toddler now calls his mom ""who's that?"" because I tried to teach him using the Socratic method."

So I was on a certain adult website having a browse of certain adult products, ended up popping some stuff in my cart until I hit the free postage amount. I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered 20% off as a new customer, and applied the discount. However, this then took me below the amount I needed to get free postage. So I decided to get one more thing to push me back over that limit. 
I did not know how far I had pushed the limit until it was too late.

I kept browsing and then decided I would get a new buttplug, maybe a slightly bigger one than current just to try it. I found a reasonably priced one in 3 sizes, 3.5 inches, 4 inches and 4.5 inches. I, the anal NOOB that I am, assumed this was in reference to LENGTH. So I clicked on the largest one to add to cart, because you know, new experience, the length doesn't seem that bad, worth a try.

Fast forward a couple days and my delivery arrives! I'm excited, I don't know what's coming. I wait for my partner to get home and we unbox it together. It's all fun and games and lighthearted until...
We unearth a MONSTROSITY of a buttplug, it is quite literally the SIZE OF MY HAND. Theres a stunned silence before I rush to explain this was an ACCIDENT and all my partner can do is crack up.

 Hope this brings you all more joy than it brought me. Honestly the best part of this is I now have an interesting story to post on reddit.

This happened last year, but yesterday I got a grim reminder.

Before we start off with this trainwreck of a story, here is some background information.

I've been a car mechanic since the age of 19 and I have my own garage/store since I was 28 years old.

After my first marriage went to shambles, I remarried a few years later. Just like my current wife, she had a son from her first marriage. My stepson was around 4 years old back then and he sees me as his real father, seeing his own father walked out on him.

My son from my first marriage was living with his mom, but I saw him quite often shop was on his way back from school, he dropped by occasionally to say hello or look at the cars I had in the shop. My wife and ex-wife actually got along well, there was never any issues with my son staying over or staying for dinner, he lived with his mom though.

When I turned 17 my dad bought me a black Chevrolet Chevelle SS, through my entire live I've always taken care of that car. I loved that car to dead, 90% of that car is still consisting of it's original parts. Seeing I'm a mechanic I had no issues doing everything myself, this car was standing in front of my shop most of the time or in my garage at home. My son, loved this car as well. He always wanted to go along for rides and he knew everything about it. He even had a small model car that looked just like it.

So, where did it go wrong you wonder? My ex-wife remarried as well 8 years ago, but they moved a few states away seeing her new husband got a new (and better paid) job offer. After that, I spoke to my son mostly on the telephone and saw him maybe once every 3-4 months for a long weekend or half a week. The phone calls became less frequent and he said he wanted to focus on his schoolwork. Seeing he was a teen and I couldn't blame him for that. My stepson was already 10 at that time. When my son was 16 he went to univeristy a few states away, I barely had time to speak to him or to see him, my business was doing bad at the time and my wife had also gotten really sick at the time with E. coli and got kidney failures. It was a tough time keeping everything together, but somehow we made it through all of it and my wife is doing far better now.

Fast forward to april 2019, my stepson was turning 16 that month. My stepson always got on with my son, so he invited him. My son was busy at the time, but promised he would show up a few days later. After all that happened I didn't see him for almost 4 years, so I was glad he was coming over. Now here comes to part where I fucked up badly. My stepson was a grade A student, even when times where tough he managed to get good grades at school and even got into the university where he wanted to study Medicine. My wife and I where so proud of him. So I decided to give him my old Chevrolet Chevelle for his 16 birthday.

He was pretty amazed by it and so were his friends, it's a car that to this day still makes an impact. It so on my son as well, one that would cost my relationship with him.

I texted him a picture of my stepson with the car on his 16 birthday party, not knowing what would happen next. My son texted me back with ""Is this a joke?""

I didn't understand at the time and texted him back with ""No, why?""

He called me not a few seconds later, yelling at me to tell him that it was a joke.

He told me that I promised him the car when he was 10 years old, that if he did well in school I would give it to him. The part that made me yell back at him through the phone was when he called me a ""louzy father that didn't care about his real son"", let me tell you things were said from both sides that weren't nice from that point onwards.

My wife told me to calm down and to talk it out because there was some misunderstanding.

I then did the most regretabble thing I've done and If I could take it back I would do it, I told my son in a fit of rage that ""he didn't deserve the car"" and that he could call me back if he changed his attitude. After I hang up the phone, I got into a fight with my wife, who stood up for my son. At that moment in time I didn't care, I was insulted for being called a bad father.

I tried to contact my son a few days afterwards, but I wouldn't get any response. I think he changed his phone number a day after the fight. I couldn't care any less at the time.

Three weeks later my ex-wife called, furious as hell. My son had apparently gratuated from University and I was (in hindsight) not invited by my son. My ex-wife already found it strange that I wasn't there, my son told her there and then what happened and that he wanted to invite me on the day he would come to visit for his graduation. The worst thing is, he was graduating as an automotive service technician and was apparantly one of the best in his class. I then realized that I was indeed, a bad father. In those 4 years of not seeing him and all the stress around me I didn't even bother to ask what he was studying. My ex-wife told me that he was heartbroken and felt like he was unwanted unlike my stepson. She started crying on the phone, saying he just wanted to be a mechanic just like you. He apparently wanted to move back and work with me in my shop and take over when I was going to retire. My entire world crumbled up in front of me, I felt and still feel so encridibly stupid for saying those things to him. My ex-wife wouldn't give me his new number and adress, seeing he wanted no contact with me ever again. She also told me to never reach out to her ever again.

It's been more then a year now, I've had a few fights about it with my wife. My stepson gave the car back and settled for something else if it ment that my son would come back.

I've tried getting into contact with him for the last 11 month's. Until a few months ago the last thing I found out that he was probably working for some big car manufacturer, but they didn't want give out any information about the people working there.

Yesterday I got a package from him, unexpectedly.

It didn't come with a letter or return adress on it, but I knew it was from him.

It was a box with his old Chevrolet toy car, an old picture ripped up of him and me on the hood of the car and a videotape. I watched the videotape, he was probably seven years old at the time, in the video I was fixing a car. I cried halfway through this, because I then knew why he mailed me the tape.

I said to him while he was filming it, if he wanted and kept up his grades that the shop could be his one day including my Chevie.

TLDR: I didn't keep my promise to my son and gave away my sports car to my stepson.Things were said and now I will never see him again.

Edit: a part I left out

Edit 1: Some of you didn't clearly read everything and that's okay. I would be mad to while reading this. My stepson is not to blame here, he gave back the car and the car is now stored in a garagebox. This car has become a thorn in my eye and I can't look at it tbh.

Edit 2: Me and family tried to search for him on facebook and all the other popular social media apps, seeing how he never was into any of those we couldnt find anything.

Edit 3: I've been searching for him for quite some time already. If this virus clears out I can travel to some states to see if he actually lives or works there.

Edit 4: After actually contacting my ex-wife a few times over the course of months, she told me half a year ago that she would ask him once to contact me. But she couldn't force him to if he didn't want to.

Edit 5: Some of you have reached out to me, I'm grateful for the help from some of you to try to help me track him down. But as you can understand I can't give out personal information about myself or my family and my son. There is already to much at stake.

Edit 6: Deleting this account. I know a lot of you people are angry. Believe me I know the feeling, I hate myself as well. I came here to share a story of how I fucked up badly, hoping some people maybe would learn of it. But the nasty messages and death threats I'm receiving in my inbox from other car enthusiasts and other upset people are really not worth it.   
From one worthless father to any father or future one, please learn from my mistake."

My GF, her mum and her sister decided to go shopping for the day. Her dad, sister’s boyfriend and I headed for the pub. We were about 3 pints in when the FU began.. 

GFs Dad: “OP, how long have you and my daughter been together now?”

Me: “Almost 6 years”

GFs Dad: “Wow, that long already. No 7 year itch yet?”

Here is where it started to unravel. I couldn’t recall the exact meaning of the phrase “7 year itch” but i thought it was meant to be a tongue in cheek question, basically asking if my GF was getting impatient about when I was to propose and when we would get married. 

Except, It doesn’t mean that at all. 

Me: “Yes, in fact, I have been thinking about it more and more recently and I expect it to be on the cards soon. Of course, when the time comes, I will ask for your blessing.”

My GFs dad choked a bit on his beer and stared at me blankly, visibly uncomfortable. I smiled and took another sip of my beer. We finished up, and headed home. 

After dinner that night, I asked my GF if her Dad was okay as he seemed off with me. I briefed her on the conversation in the pub. She stopped me halfway through, with a huge grin on her face, struggling to contain her laughter. 

She went on to explain that the phrase “7 year itch” is in fact a saying or popular belief that after 7 years, a relationship or marriage declines and often results in one of both parties having an affair. 

So in essence, I told my girlfriend’s father that I had been thinking about the decline of our relationship and when the time came, I would be asking his blessing to sleep with other women. 

Thankfully, my future in- laws are good people. Once I explained my FU and apologised, they laughed it off and we forgot about it :)

TL;DR 

I misunderstood a common phrase and effectively told my girlfriend’s father that our relationship was in peril and I would be asking his blessing to have an affair.

EDIT:

Wow this blew up! Thank you kind strangers for the awards and all the wholesome comments. Just to clear a couple things up.. 

1) There are a few people calling me out and calling me an arsehole for wanting to ask permission to marry my girlfriend. First of all, I would like to say this is a common and traditional practise in the U.K. one which I don’t particularly agree with. That said, my girlfriends family are very traditional people and would likely be offended if I didn’t ask. I am going to respect their traditions, even if I don’t agree with them. My girlfriend is fully aware of this and agrees it is the right thing to do.

2) Many people have questioned why the hell my girlfriends dad would ask that and they are trying to somehow psychoanalyse the situation. I have known my girlfriends dad for many years, we are good friends and often go to the pub, watch football etc. He didn’t ask the question seriously and was joking. I think it was meant rhetorically and my response took him by surprise (probably the stupidity of it) and was trying to make sense of it before the girls turned up shortly and we had to leave.

3) I have changed “permission” to “blessing” as it has been pointed out that the former implies it’s ultimately the decision of her parents, which it isn’t. Thanks to those who pointed this out :)"

It's RFID, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

I'm a junior, and I've been getting into the building the same way for years. I keep my ID Card in my back pocket, so I just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. That sounds a little weird to write, but I promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and I'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

Only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. As a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our ID out to show him as we walked in.

Coming in at 8:00AM, after years of habit... I was on autopilot.

I approached the security guard, he said, ""ID?"" and I nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (Obviously I didn't hear the beep, so I guess my brain thought I wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

It all took about two seconds, and when I felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, I suddenly realized what I was doing... but before I could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""Woah woah woah! Miss! I just the need the ID, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

I tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. Couple of other students saw so I'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

TL;DR: Decided I could bribe my way into school without an ID by giving the security guard a lapdance... I was right."

Now it's important for context that you understand how pretty my dogs are. They are both rescue husky mixes that look fairly unusual and have really beautiful blue eyes. It's not out of the ordinary for people to stop me and ask about them, compliment them, and want to pet them. Having these ridiculously gorgeous dogs has somewhat desensitized me to people yelling out of car windows and across streets because maybe three times a week someone will yell a dog-compliment at us.

So we were walking along the sidewalk when a man working on some new construction across the street yelled, ""Oh my God, I love your doggers!"" 

I gave him a big smile and yelled back, ""Thanks! Wanna say hi?"" He looked slightly surprised but smiled and started walking over. When he crossed the street he was suddenly acting a bit awkward and not really paying much attention to the dogs. I had them sit so maybe he'd feel comfortable petting them, but honestly I was getting a weird vibe now and wanted to get on my way. We then had the following interaction: 

Him: So do you want to give me your Snap? 
Me: Um, no thanks. You can say hi to them here, and I'm going to get going. 
Him: Here? You just wanna... *mimes pulling down a shirt*

Here's where I realize all at once that I'd fucked up. I had been desensitized by years of dog-compliments and am now putting the pieces together that this man had very-likely catcalled me and I was basically a cat-callers dream, friendly and receptive to his advancement by smiling and inviting him over to say hi. My mind locked on to what he had originally yelled. 

Oh my God, I love your doggers!

I love your doggers!

Doggers!

Finally, my dumbass brain puts the peices together and I squeak out a horrified, ""Did you say you love my knockers?"" He nods yes and I wish I could say I had some cleaver retort, but honestly I just gave him a firm point of my index finger and an exasperated, ""no!"" before the pups and I hightailed it outta there. 


TL:DR I thought a random man was complimenting my dogs. Invited him to come say hi. Turns out, he was cat-calling me.

She was having sex with her boyfriend and saying “please stop it hurts, stop it.” I ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. I was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. I threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. My daughter was frantically explaining to me that it’s a fetish and he wasn’t actually hurting her. I told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and I rushed him to the hospital. He’s doing okay now and isn’t suffering any major injuries but I feel awful. I’m not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and I truly thought he was hurting her.

Obligatory 'this happened yesterday'.

The day before yesterday, my foster daughter had a bunch of her friends over to watch the premier of the new BTS video. I'd check on them every now and then and every time I saw them, they were doing these weird stretches with their arms over their heads or behind their backs. After a while, I asked, 'what are you guys doing?' They said it was a flexibility test they learned from friends at school.

Move 1: [Clasp your hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/lSDPR7B) with one hand going over your shoulder and one going under.

Move 2: [Prayer hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/VmJaqGY).

Move 3: [Touch your elbows behind your back](https://imgur.com/gallery/v5kNu7f).

Most of the kids could do 1 and 2, and they were laughing at each other's struggles to do 3.

After a while, their video started and they moved on to more important things.

The next morning at work, I was curious to see if I could do the stretches. I stood in front of the full length mirror in my office and tried them. 1 was a little tough, especially in a button down shirt. 2 was easy and felt pretty good. 3 seemed to conflict with basic human anatomy. I tried different angles and wrist positions and didn't even come close.

While I was doing this, a young female co-worker comes over and asks what I'm doing much like I did the previous night. I explain the stretches and figure she'll have more work since she's younger and in better shape than me.

Stretch 1, no problem. Stretch 2, it's like she was born to do this. Then she tries to touch her elbows behind her back and the buttons of her blouse completely give up. I'm staring at her in the mirror with her shirt split open with nothing underneath. She looked shocked and embarrassed. She covered up and walked out of the room.

I run to the supply closet to grab a promotional t-shirt that we hand out at events and give it to her in her office. Then I go back to the room with the mirror to find her button, which I ended up sewing back on before anyone else made it to the office.

tl;dr: I asked a young female co-worker to try a difficult stretch. Which led to her blouse splitting open while we were alone in the office."

Sorry for my possible slips as English is not my mothertongue. I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

I've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

See, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""Accounts"" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.

Later in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.

I'm sorry. I didn't want to. Please, forgive me everyone.
I'll commit Sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.

I was relaxing in my living room while my parents were out. I had just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper and I was watching TV and browsing random junk on my phone to relax when I had a small itch on my testicles (This is a warning that this post will be getting a little graphic)  
I went downtown to scrotum town to give the crown jewels a scratch and, in my unfocussed state, I missed slightly and scratched down the back of the tube-like thing that's attached to your balls. (which I later learned is called the epididymis) This made me flinch slightly as the sensation on my jubblies was completely unexpected.  
I didn't think about it though, scratched the itch in the correct place and carried on watching TV.  
  
Within about half an hour though, my lack of sleep started to catch up on me (very suddenly) and I felt myself drifting off to sleep at about 2pm.  
  
I woke up at 2:45 to a numbing, sort of dull ache on my left penny in my coin purse. I thought nothing of it though and hoisted myself upright to drink water and then went back to sleep.  
  
I woke up a little later completely keeled over in the fetal position with my arms between my legs. I don't remember waking up but I was in this incredible pain, like I'd snapped a muscle in my balls. I can't really describe it but my left testicle felt ""different"" almost. Like it had gotten lumpy, bigger and soft. As I tried to right myself, sit up and adjust my pants, the pain struck all the way up my body and I vomited onto the carpet.  
At this point I decided I needed to go to hospital so went on my phone and ordered an Uber there.  
  
In what ended up being the most excruciating pain I've ever felt, I lay on the floor next to my vomit and waited an agonising 10 minutes for the Uber to arrive. Once it had, I bit my tongue and dragged myself (as upright as possible) to the front door and into the back of the Uber. The Uber driver didn't really give a shit as I groaned and clenched in the back of the car and sort of dumped me outside the hospital. The next thing I remember was standing in line for the emergency room before trying to sit down. (I found out later that I had actually collapsed)  
  
I woke up the next morning with one less testicle, a very scared mother and a lesson in something called ""testicular torsion"".

I thought that because it was Halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but NOPE!

NOT A SOUL.

Nobody wore or did ANYTHING to celebrate. I know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion I spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. I'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state I'm only at school like 50% of the time, and I thought ""maybe this time I can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy Halloween.

its safe to say I was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if I see someone else with a costume on I might feel better but this was overkill, I'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that I likely wont be made fun of but costuming will ALWAYS be my passion and someday I will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

So back in 1988, my dad went with his friends to a vacation in Greece. By extreme luck, somehow, my dad found David Bowie, riding on a rented motorcycle. My dad, who's a really big fan of him, went to him and asked him if is it cool to take a picture with him. David agreed and even let my dad to seat on the motorcycle behind him for the picture. My dad, overly excited, set down on the motorcycle *really* close to David, and one of my dad's friends took the picture for him. 
Back for today, i asked my dad if it's cool if i'll upload the photo for r/oldschoolcool because i knew that sort of pictures are welcomed in the sub. So instead of thinking an extra second, i wrote in the title ""my dad with David Bowie in a vacation in Greece. 1988""
(I didn't even noticed the typo ""in a vacation"")
Because of my dumbass title and my dad sitting to close to Bowie, literally all of the comments are how my dad and Bowie had sex on that vacation and how my dad is actually gay. For now I posted the picture about 7 hourse ago, and it reached to r/all with 55k upvotes and 2.4k comments with with almost all of the comments are in the style of ""your'e adopted"" your dad and Bowie def banged bro"" etc. 
At the start it was really funny, i showed some of the comments to my dad and he laughed his ass off, but now with like 2.5k comments like that it's just straight up chaos.
The internet is a beutiful mess.

Fair warning. 

Last week, I adopted my first dog. His name is Franklin Beans and he is the absolute shit. Apparently his last owner was the human equivalent of a wet sandwich without any condiments on it. My dude was not in great shape when the fosters got him a few weeks ago. Since coming home, Franky B has been a real treat though. He has, unfortunately, had some nervous shit. I took this as further proof that Franklin and I were meant to be. My butthole is also afraid of working in new places. 

Yesterday morning, I woke up in bed with my partner and Beans. My alarm goes off around six and I wake up to start another glorious day of teaching first graders online (yes, I have recently developed a drinking problem). As I'm fixing my tea in the kitchen, I hear a tiny dog fart. Franklin Beans is taking a shit in my living room. Oh rats! This seems like a slide backwards in the progress we made this week. Whatever. I go grab a baggie to remove the dookie from my beautiful original hard wood floors and see that there are WORMS on it. Little flat white 1/4 inch MOVING GODDAMN WORMS. I freak the fuck out, quietly because my partner is still sleeping. As I'm cleaning this up, I remember a reddit post about a cat with worms and rush to my bed to find just what I suspected: HUNDREDS OF TINY LITTLE DEAD DRIED UP WORMS. I unsuccessfully do my best to coax my partner to the couch without scaring him. I take Franklin outside to let him get the evil out of him. He immediately starts shitting again. But wait, that doesn't even look like poop... it looks like...MORE AND BIGGER WORMS. DEAR GOD. Poor Frankin is now dragging his tiny little snake hole across the cement, desperately trying to get these fuckers to unlatch. It was breaking my heart so I tried to use the plastic bag I carry for his booty presents to pull the stowaway from his tunnel. Guys, this worm was at least six inches long. It was HORRIFYING. On our walk around the block, this happens about ten more times. By the time we reach my apartment, I'm honestly impressed that I haven't fainted or screamed or thrown the whole dog out into a neighbor's bin. 

I get back to my apartment and the poor little dude is still scooting all over those beautiful wood floors I mentioned previously. I call up the vet and start describing the nightmare that I am living, because at this point I'm pretty sure my dog is just a big cute bag of worms. While pacing around, I step in something wattery. I look reluctantly look down to see what appears to be a writhing fistfull of ramen noodles in a puddle of strawberry jam. I lose my ABSOLUTE SHIT and let out a blood curdling scream. This only frightens poor little Beans into releasing more worms from his bowels. I cancel my first live lesson and rush this spaghetti maker over to the vet for a drop off appointment, so I can get home and teach those tiny little psychopaths about verbs and shit. Around lunch time they call me to diagnose him as having a literal butt-ton of tapeworms. We talk care and recovery and I, still, am feeling slightly proud of myself for being as calm as I am. I hang up the call and return to my students, who are finishing up with lunch. As I log into the Teams Meeting, I see one of my students eating the worst possible food for this day: A fucking Cup O Noodles. I can no longer handle this situation. In a shameful display of squeamishness, I proceed to vom all over my couch. On camera. In front of students and parents. Children are shrieking. I'm shrieking. I have no idea how I'm going to explain this on Monday. 

TL;DR Unknowingly got myself a pup o' noodles and lost my lunch over a cup o' noodles."

I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.

Silly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

Laughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

Now I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job."" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

This was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.

Two weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

I'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y'know sir?""

""Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.

Apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

Until tonight, I've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.

Thank you Army. I will never forget you.

TlDr; Army overpaid me 2 cents, I paid them back three and had to mop floors for their fuckup because feds have sticks up their asses by birth."
k07vpo,TIFU by donating my hair and having my boyfriend break up with me,40927,0.89,3578,2020-11-24 21:41:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k07vpo/tifu_by_donating_my_hair_and_having_my_boyfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k07vpo/tifu_by_donating_my_hair_and_having_my_boyfriend/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So I have always had extremely long hair. Just yesterday it reached the floor when it was down. It was thick and healthy and well cared for. Recently my mother was diagnosed with cancer and it’s been a horrible time for all of us. She recently started her chemo treatments and no one is sure what’ll happen, but we all hope she’ll be okay. She began losing all her hair from the treatments, it wasn’t nearly as long as mine, but she still loved it and had really healthy hair. So I started talking with my boyfriend about donating it and we agreed I should. So yesterday I shaved my head completely bald even with a razor and everything. I had it all nicely separated and donateable and I went to a pretty highly regarded charity (I did ask if they could make one for my mother and they agreed). Afterwards I went about my day. Then I went back home and me and soon after my boyfriend came home, he was shocked to find that I was bald and thought when I was donating it I’d only cut off a little bit. I thought this was weird since I mentioned buzzing everything off since my mother was bald as well. He said he never thought I’d do it. But we changed the subject quickly and ate dinner before going to bed. This morning I woke up when he was getting up for work and he told me he couldn’t be with a bald girl. I kindly reminded him it would grow back to which he replied that it would take too long. So he broke up with me and left my apartment. Leaving me alone, hairless, and scared. 

TL;DR: I donated all of my super long hair and my boyfriend broke up with me because he didn’t want to be with a bald girl

Edit: I’m feeling a lot better now. The only thing I’m sorry about now is that people keep giving awards to a throwaway account that I entered random letters into as the password

Edit 2: Guys this is a throwaway, stop giving me all these awards lol. I do really appreciate all the kind messages though lol"

So last night me, my girlfriend (both 22) went out clubbing with her younger brother (18) to celebrate him being able to drink legally. We didn’t wanna pay for a hotel so we borrowed their parent’s little caravan and at about 3am we all went back to the caravan all very drunk. 

My girlfriend has a habit of getting VERY horny when she’s drunk, which normally is great, but she also has absolutely zero boundaries or logic when in that state beyond sexual urges. 

We had to share a double bed inside the caravan, obviously I was expecting us all to sleep straight away, but literally 2 minutes after we laid down my girlfriend was pulling my pants down, and she started to suck my dick. Her brother was on the other side of the bed, he was pretty drunk and saw this happening and just laughed at it, I felt kinda weird at the time but I was also pretty drunk and just let it happen. He obviously didn’t watch the whole time but he did look back and forth and kept laughing at it. 

Anyway it’s the morning now and they’re both still asleep and the regret is starting to sink in, I have no idea how I’m gonna look him in the eye after this, and I’m kinda just worried that this will have long term repercussions for him and her. Gonna be a fun day.

jdg89r,TIFU by hooking my girlfriend up with a job at a company I work for,40843,0.88,1571,2020-10-18 18:50:54,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jdg89r/tifu_by_hooking_my_girlfriend_up_with_a_job_at_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jdg89r/tifu_by_hooking_my_girlfriend_up_with_a_job_at_a/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Happened years ago, but I was told to post this here.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were dating for just shy of 6 years. We were high school sweethearts and still in school. She had always struggled with jobs and keeping them, and since we lived together, I usually had to pick up the slack. 

I was working as an assistant manager at a video game retail store at the time, probably not hard to figure out which one. It was honestly and easy job as long as you gave little effort, pre orders here, couple warranty sells there. As my girlfriend loved video games more than I did, I had the BRILLIANT idea to get her a job. She's an attractive girl while 80% of our customers were neckbeards who hardly get to interact with women. Should be easy for her to make sales.

""There's no way she can fuck this up"" I said, confidently to myself. There is a policy as of most companies that people in relationships can't work at the same location. No problem. We have 12 stores in our district that are within a 5 mile radius. 

They seriously put these stores on every other block.

I do a little digging and hook her up at a neighboring store that had a vacant position. She would also be working with the head store manager of the district (indirectly one of my bosses). Few weeks in, and its going GREAT, what took me about a year to get moved up she does in weeks. I'm not a self conscious person, so I didnt care. Plus she could help pick up her half of the bills. 

Here's where I started to realize I FU. Girlfriend comes driving in with a BRAND NEW CAR. Considering we were living paycheck to paycheck, I was pretty upset. I asked her where she got the car from and she told me ""I've been saving up"". Bullshit but okay. I loved her, so as long as shes happy, I'm happy. 

Next comes in with write ups. I started getting write ups and customer complaints left and right. I'm a very good employee and I very rarely make anyone upset. I couldn't even find where these customers were coming from. Even though my performance was the best out of most employees, I was starting to fear for my job.

As to be predicted, I ended up getting fired. I tried to fight it but I live in Texas, and the rules are that companies can fire anyone at anytime for any reason. I'm absolutely crushed. I turn to my girlfriend for emotional support to find her extremely distant. 

She dumped me days later, double whammy. I loved her for 6 years. She told me she felt this way for a while, things are the same. I'm absolutely heartbroken, I'm angry, depressed, jobless. Felt like my life got flipped upside down. One week later her Facebook status put her in a relationship WITH HER BOSS. MY BOSS. 

Not sure when it happened, but he bought her a car, and then got me fired. Turns out all the customer complaints about me originated from that store somehow. Total BS. I set her up to absolutely f*ck me over and to bone my boss.

Tl;dr: I got my girlfriend a job only for her to f*ck my boss and to get me fired 

I'm still a little sad about it, but it is what it issss.

Edit: perhaps the biggest FU is the fact I didn't sue. I was such an emotional wreck from everything it didnt even cross my mind. But I'm doing pretty well for myself now, and whatever money I'd get wouldn't be worth bringing her to court for. Just the thought of seeing her sends chills down my spine.

UPDATE: A couple of you guys were wondering, but they dated a few months and broke it off. Neither of them work for the company anymore. A little detail I forgot to mentioned that when she came to take her stuff from our place, he was helping carry the stuff to her car. That was probably the most gut wrenching moment for me. Both of them are POS.

2nd Update: I really appreciate all the positive feedback, I've been mostly over it but the love really helps. Some of you guys are asking where she is now, she's doing alright, shes engaged to one of my old high school friends (also slightly suspicious). Still driving that same car, too, from the looks of it. I'm doing pretty well for myself, and if theres any happy ending to this, is that I'm genuinely happier than I've ever been in my life.

3rd AND PROBABLE FINAL UPDATE: Again, I really appreciate the positive messages. Reliving and retelling the story made me angry and I missed a few details.

-I can't prove that he bought her a car, but I was pretty aware of her finances, and she couldn't afford a new car without significant help. It wasn't a fancy car, it was a new Prius that was worth about $18,000, in addition to trading in her old car. And the rumor around the block was that he did in fact help her. 

-i was not a perfect boyfriend, I got upset at silly things, I could have been more attentive, but I never raised my voice, and I was very loyal. 

-the course of when she got promoted to when she got the car was roughly 3 or 4 months, the separation and firing happened about 2 months after that. I didn't clarify that detail. 

-""the boss"" was a DM in training, recently got promoted, and the kind of guy that would spend money to impress a girl."

After work one day I went to a hotel bar. The bartender was super cute and the bar was practically empty so we chatted for over an hour. As I was getting ready to leave a bunch of people sat down at the bar and she got busy, I didn't want to ask for her number in front of a bunch of people who were trying to order, or wait around, so I wrote my number on the check and left. I was half way home when I got a text from her. I excitedly opened my phone to ""hey it's Sara the bartender at (hotel name), you didn't pay your bill"" and my heart sank into my stomach. I texted her my card number and apologized. She never texted me back.

TL;DR - Tried to leave my phone number on a check. I left, and got a text from her saying I didn't pay.

***EDIT: Ok guys I went through my phone history and found the texts. Yes it's embarrassing. https://imgur.com/a/531ds7h

***UPDATE: The last text she sent was the end of the conversation. It's been over 7 months since this happened and I never texted her back after that. I did send her a link to this post though... and she replied!

I text my date what's happening. Go back to theater with my new date. Sit a few rows in front of my first date.

I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. 

Fast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. 

He owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed. 

TLDR: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than I ever will."

https://imgur.com/gallery/NAxCp8y

*Edited to say: yes, he explained that he was “micro”, that’s how I learned the term. Not a grow-er. 2, of course I’m not going to tell anyone and 3, no he hasn’t texted me back yet. 
**edit #2: the movie was Parasite 


Throwaway, because obvious. 
This happened last night and I feel so bad and embarrassed. Before now I had no idea micropenis was a thing. Some people are big, some people are small. That was the extent of my penile knowledge. I’ve only had sex with 2 people, so I’m not very experienced, anyway. 

This guy and I have mutual friends and have been flirting for months, and he’s *so hot* with a great personality. Last night after a few of our friends canceled I asked him if he wanted to come over and watch a movie.

He comes over, I make dinner and we have a great time. We have a couple glasses of wine and I’m not quite tipsy, but loose enough that I don’t think about what I’m saying. We move over to the living room to start a movie, and he starts making a move. I’m thinking oh yeah, here we go. Finally. It’s getting hot and heavy and I start making my way downtown because blowjobs are my favorite thing. I pull down his pants and for a minute I’m shocked. He has absolutely no length at all, basically just a head. I think something happened to him and say “oh my god, what happened?!” And he kinda freezes and says nothing happened. I’m confused and he starts awkwardly kind of explaining that everything works, obviously, that’s just his size. At this point it’s awkward enough that it kinda kills the mood and he says “I mean, we don’t have to do anything” and I starts babbling that no no, it’s fine, everything is okay! I can tell he feels weird at this point and kind of sits up on the couch, and I’m thinking I’ve ruined this and he doesn’t want to hook up anymore. I say “are you still turned on? Do you want to?” And he kind of gives me a blank look which prompts my dumb ass to say “I’m sorry it’s just that I can’t tell”

What I *meant* was that I can’t tell if he still wants to have sex by his body language, *not* that I can’t tell if he’s turned on because of his lack of noticeable erection. This completely extinguished whatever we had going and he pulls his pants up while I’m trying to explain. He won’t let me talk and keeps repeating that no, no, it’s fine, we should watch the movie. Not knowing what to do I sit back on the couch and we awkwardly watch the tv in mortified silence. Eventually when it’s over (I’m surprised he stayed) he basically rushes out the door. 

I texted him this morning asking if he wants to hang out again and apologized for making things weird. He hasn’t texted me back and he’s been on Instagram so I know he’s seen it. I feel so bad! And it doesn’t really matter that his penis is small, I’d still go out with him anyway! It’s not enough to deter me. But I totally ruined it and now he hates me

TL;DR insulted my hookups penis and made him feel weird and now I not only ruined sex but ruined any future chances"

It is bad. 

This happened about three months ago. For context I live with my girlfriend in an apartment with one bedroom. 

My sister was visiting from out of town. She said she'd sleep in the couch. I thought that would be that. We ate dinner, chatted, had a good time. When  it was time to go to bed, however, i was feeling horny. I turned off the hall light and then opened the door to crawl onto out Queen size bed. I don't see shit. So I crawl in on my side, wait a few minutes, and then it happens. 

I turn to my girlfriend. Her back is facing me. I grab her ass and whisper ""I'd love to fuck you."" those exact words. 

Turns out my girlfriend is a good hostess. She had offered to sleep on my couch instead of my sister. I ended up grabbing my sister's ass and telling her id love to fuck her. 

My sister turned to me. ""Max?"" I recognized her voice. 

I hoped out of bed. I was mortified. I ran into the living room and, sure enough, there was my girlfriend. I ran back into the bedroom and apologized to my sister. We both got a good laugh out of it, at least, even if I was laughing through the tears. 

TL;DR My girlfriend and sister switched rooms without telling me. I ended up grabbing my sister's ass and saying I'd love to fuck her.

Edit: I am now single. 23 male. Bisexual. Please fullfill the empty hole left in my life.

Edit two: So the reason she broke up with me is two reasons: She's a controlling ass and she thought I had exposed her privacy because my full first name is in the username. Such bullshit."

I thought “its just a patch.” So in my infinite stupidity, I slapped it on my arm.

Mistake. Within 20 minutes I felt like I was dying. I was lightheaded, my pulse was crazy fast, and I felt more nauseous than I ever felt in my life. I proceeded to vomit my entire breakfast and lunch. I was sitting on the toilet, pooping, and barfing into a bag at the same time.

I feel better now and thank God I ripped off that patch. I am never, ever touching a cigarette or alcohol or any other drugs ever again. I’m also going to be eating nutritious foods everyday and start to really take care of my body. Jesus take the wheel.

TL;DR: Never fucking smoke or do drugs or drink, holy shit, being healthy and feeling good is so important."

My son is a week old and I have been home with mom and baby the whole time. Needless to say I was getting a little restless at home even with the lack of sleep that comes with a new kid. 

For obvious reasons my wife and I couldn’t pass the time in the bedroom as normal. Mainly due to the expected impact of childbirth. My son’s huge head didn’t help things. So I decided not to bother my wife and sleeping baby and slipped off to the bathroom with phone and lotion to discreetly take care of business. 

Perusing my go-to site I find the video of choice. First thing that pops up is an ad of a girl yelling “Oh Baby” with the volume on my phone at full blast. I quickly turn it down and proceed to business. 

I return to my wife in the living room and all I see is shock on her face as he holds my son looking worried. I ask “what’s wrong” fearing she is mad at me for taking care of business solo. She looked at me dead serious and said “Something whispered ‘Hey baby’ to our son after you left and now I’m freaked out.”

For some background my wife believes in ghosts/spirits as crazy as it sounds. She has told me about seeing odd things in our house and believing she heard people talking before. So this did not help and she is even more worried with our new addition. 

She is currently burning sage through our house to ‘remove the spirits.’ I don’t have the heart to tell her I was just horny and she overheard me watching porn. 

TL;DR: I tickled my pickle with no volume discipline and an ad played where the actress said ‘baby.’ Now my wife thinks our house is haunted and ghosts want to talk to our baby."

Edit: woke up to this on the front page of TIFU, lots of different opinions on the matter, I obviously changed little ray rays name just in case some of his family is on reddit and comes across this post. Don't get me wrong, the kid is a cool kid but he isn't exactly family to me as he is my cousin's wife's sister's son. Just glad some of you all found the humor in this as I definitely laughed at my self for being such a dumbass about forgetting the cancer thing.

Puzzled, I told her I didn’t know what she was talking about. She said “The note. The one I put it your lunch today.” I told her I didn’t see a note. But the way she said “today” made it feel like this wasn’t the first time. I said “Wait. Have you written me a note before?”

She said “Yes. Have you never seen them?” So apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and I’ve thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

TLDR: my fiancée was being sweet as per usual, and I was literally throwing it in the garbage can."

Yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her BFFs. They usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

Around that time I’m usually at the gym so to not disturb them. But yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so I went there an hour earlier.

Sometimes after I come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
So I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn’t hear me.
That’s when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

I busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
Her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they’ve never seen a man’s privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. 

The silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: „Good plan, bad execution.“ Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

I even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

Tl;dr: Busted naked into my SO’s girl evening.

**Edit:** Holy shit, rip my inbox. Thanks to everyone for their funny comments, upvotes and to the anonymous benefactors for their gold/silver.

And now to answer the most asked questions:

Yes, I asserted dominance by slapping everyone with my dick and yelling „Piñata! Piñata!“

Of course I ran home naked to surprise my girlfriend.

Yes, I plan to marry my SO. Plan includes me naked-manning her girls evening again with her ring around my cock and a bow tie. 

Yes, I will post an update when the time comes. Don’t know how long that will take though.

Yes, the update will include a live stream.

And the most asked question: yes, I’m well equipped and stormed the castle with a raging boner and in helicopter motion. Dick stopped at 2 o’clock, when I realized the fuck up."

My GF (now wife) and I were spending time with her family at her grandma’s house. Her grandma had a Nintendo Wii at the time, and my GF’s brother would have been five years old. As you can expect, he always wanted to play the Wii and any mention of it would guarantee his excitement and begging for inclusion.


It was nearly the little guy’s bedtime and I whispered to my GF, “You want to play the Wii when your brother goes to bed?” She said, “Yes” and we were excited for him to go to bed. Since the Wii was located in the family living room, I decided I would sneakily let the family know we were reserving the TV for an epic match of Wii Tennis.


I approached my GF’s mom, uncle, and grandma and said, “If you guys don’t mind.... we’d like to use the living room once the little guy goes to bed.”


*silence*


Me: “You know..... for....”


(me thinking)


“Three letter word....”


Her family made faces I will never forget as they thought of a different three letter word that I wanted to partake in with their beloved daughter/granddaughter/niece in the living room.


I realized my mistake after a good ten seconds of funny faces being throw my way, and I fumbled over my explanation of “oh dear god I meant we want to play the Wii!”


TLDR: Wanted to play the Wii with my GF, and told her family we wanted to do a “three letter word” in the living room which made them think of sex.


**Edit: Since enough people have asked, we actually wanted to play Wii. This was not a cover up for sex.**"

I'm 26 now. 

Well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and I had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. It's where I got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

While I sat amongst rubble and dirt, I had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

Again, I wasn't bright. 

Well. I drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

That said, I flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly I can't remove it. Not a single adult was even aware I was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

So when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

I lost my mind.

My dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. Probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. Whatever really.

Either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that I was overreacting.

Okay. Sure.

Let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and I'm in highschool.

This is where the real fun begins. Equalbrium (Equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. I could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. Plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. Was a nightmare, really.

I get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" I had long ago forgotten.

All I hear is scrapes.

Scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

I'll admit, I immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. That's another topic entirely.

Well wouldn't you know, though? The doctor said I was faking, examined my ear, and said I just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. Right. It was probably June at the time.

My mom didn't really believe him, but I decided ""balls to it. Let's get some Hydro-Perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

Skip along the years a bit more, I'm 18 and I know for a fact there is something In-My-Fucking-Head. I'm losing it. So I hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""There's definitely blockage. I'm not sure if it's a rock, but I can certainly try to help.""

So this Professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of Scissor-Hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. It was audio torture, hands down. Rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

The end results? ""You'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

I'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

The sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and I began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when I reflect back.

Let's time jump one last time. I'm 22, couple months away from 23, I have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. Great.

But now, out of the blue, I'm losing Hand-Eye coordination. Well damn, you know? I attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

I lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that I could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

Three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. But that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

This was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and I locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

Eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. In an instant I froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

Jackpot.

Now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
The pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like I was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

All in all, 2/10. Wouldn't do again.

But now it's totally out and I have it put away in a ziplock bag.

I had no real recovery issues I guess. As soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. Now it just rings occasionally.

My balance won't ever be the same I feel, but it's fine enough as is. Otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, I have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and I get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

Not a bad trade out.

[Size reference](https://i.imgur.com/xAxLEG9.png)

&nbsp;

**_EDIT_**: For everyone calling me an idiot, trust me I know. For everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and I've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. It's fine. This is why I can laugh it off.

**_Another Edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. Had to check a few timestamps.

I'm currently 26.

Also, spelling

&nbsp;

TLDR: I put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn't believe me, the other couldn't help. Pulled it out myself after 13 years when I was 22 and now I can't swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and I have poor balance."

I paused when I heard her say, “And then the wombat waved goodbye and off he went. Wiishoo! Wiishooo!!” I asked her later what those sounds represent and she told me his wings. When I explained that wombats don’t have wings and are essentially huge marsupials, I broke her childhood.  Her dad, a wonderful man who passed last year, used to tell her and her sister this same bedtime story. She immediately called her 40-year-old sister and asked her if she knew wombats didn’t have wings (“no!”), then her widowed mom (“no!”). All three were used to her dad’s wholesome story about the talking womBAT and apparently never came across a photo of the Australian animal in 37 years.

TL;DR: I broke it to three adults that a wombat doesn’t have wings, so their treasured childhood bedtime stories proved to be “inaccurate.”

Edit: Thanks for the wonderful thoughts, awards, and interest from many of you. I know people want the bedtime story, but it’s actually a series of stories; think fairytale meets Princess Bride. He intended to make some children’s books, but for now they’re still favorite bedtime stories. We may write them down soon, but it’s hard to translate the sound effects and voices to text. I just worry that some of you might not like the story, especially if you find out that the wombat is the villain(!)....and don’t worry, the kids still think wombats have wings!"

She'll latch on and stay on through the night and often throughout the day. My wife and I both feel it's excessive and have tried different methods to ween her off nursing, or at least slow her down. Nothing seems to work. For context, my boy is 5 and was done with it at 1.5yrs old, It seemed like a very easy and natural step for him,

Different story for my little girl.

My wife is exhausted by it, we're not having more kids so she often blurts out she's so ""done with it"" and ""wants to cut them off"".

Yikes.

I've suggested some other methods and even prepared bottles for her but she (my daughter) isn't having any of it. I'll even get up at 2, 4 and 5am to give her cups of milk. No go.

Today seemed like a breaking point for my wife, she lashed out with a ""leave me alone"" to my girl who was really clawing at her shirt. Oh my.

I feel a little hopeless in this whole situation but I thought I had a clever stroke - and mistakenly suggested it:

""Why don't you rub habanero sauce on your nipples  \*snicker\*""

She jumped up, ran to the fridge and I thought ""no way"".

I went to see what she was doing and, sure enough, standing there with the fridge door wide open, my wife was rubbing my hot sauce all over her nipples

""Dear, you're not serious. I was kidding. That stuff is \*really\* nasty hot.""

""I have to do something."" And I have to admit she really seems at her wits end but this seems.. Harsh.

I'm now pleading with her to try different ideas, she can't be serious. But now my wife is dancing around the kitchen ""OUCH! OUCH! PSSSHHHTT! HOTTT!!! HOLYSHIT! OW! OW! OWWW!"" Half-laughing, she eventually ""cool's off"" but this goes on for a while and I'm trying not to laugh but she looks ridiculous bouncing around the kitchen clutching her boobs.

Later on, we're curled up on the couch watching a show and, right on cue, my girl wants to nurse. My wife let her latch on. I'm watching because I'm freaked out, witnessing a slow-mo train wreck, and my wife has an actual grin on her face.

It didn't go well.

My daughter pulled back in horror and is now afraid to go near mommy's boobs. I had to rescue her and brought her to get a glass of milk. She tried again recently but thought better of it, taking a sniff instead and abandoning hope.

What have I done?

My wife feels like she has a huge victory. I feel like I've witnessed the birth of a supervillain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR Foolishly suggested my wife rub hot sauce on her boobs to stop our daughter from constantly nursing.

**UPDATE**: We're having lots of fun reading through all the comments, lots of laughs and love here, thanks everyone. 

I took another shot at being 'clever' again and suggested, as we're cuddled on the couch - that, as payback, to avenge my daughter, I'd dip my BEEPBOOP in hotsauce so mommy could get a taste of her own medicine.

We laughed for a moment but then quickly realized that's just a scorched-earth / nobody wins scenario. 

No more hotsauce anywhere for a long while..."

I do it every time I have a rock hard boner especially when I'm in no mood to jerk off. 

Last week, I was at my parents house for dinner. So, after I was done with my dinner, I was horny so decided to head back to my old room and have a little sausage massage session. 

I put on some ebony porn, and started to slowly play with myself. Halfway through, I lost interest, but I had a rock solid boner, so I decided to shift gears with it. So, I put on some manual transmission car racing videos on my TV, and shifted gears with my dick whenever the guys in the video shifted the gears. I was trying to match the timing, and it was fun. 

The fun lasted for 10 minutes, until my dad barged into my room to ask me if I would fancy some ice cream. The puzzled look on his face said everything.

Well last night I woke up from a 4 hour mid-day nap at around 10 o'clock and I deliriously remembered I had to take my medication. My mom keeps my meds in her room so she can distribute them to me when I need them + my parents room is in a loft so I have to shout upstairs to let them know I'm coming. 

I go to their door and knock

""Hello!"" I shout up the stairs

I proceed to walk up the stairs to see if they're even home... they were. My dad had his face buried in my mothers crotch, he was eating her out.

(Goosebumps)

   I quickly shuffled down the stairs as quietly as I could, hyperventilating from the H.P. Lovecraft X Blumhouse Production I just witnessed. My mom didn't hear me, she was covering her face with a pillow. My dad didn't hear me, he is deaf.

   That image has stained my memory and I spent the next hour lying in bed staring at the ceiling. I am truly sorry to any kid who has to witness their dad performing cunnilingus on their mother.

Kinda felt like my teenage years when i didn't want to give it up, yet. He got me off a few times with mouth and fingers. It was amazing. 

I went down to return the favor. I was getting into it and doing my best work. Just as he was coming in my mouth, I suddenly thought, ""everything I swallow goes to my baby.""  It grossed me out. I started gagging and had to run to the bathroom and threw up all my dinner. I couldn't stop the reaction. He comes in and holds my hair and cleans up the splatter on the toilet while I'm brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. 

So, now I'm worried that I've hurt my husband or made him feel like he's unattractive or something. He's not acting weird about it but I'm afraid he's bothered and hiding it, even though he's assuring me that he's not. 

I feel like a shitty wife. Damn hormones and overthinking brain.

TLDR hormones and overthinking caused me to throw up after giving my husband a blow job because I didn't want my baby eating her siblings.


Edit: I did explain right away. He just said, ""Well, I guess we're not doing that for a while."" Also, I've taken biology classes. I know it's an irrational thought. Pregnancy is full of those. As for brushing my teeth, we were headed right to bed and I didn't want to sleep with puke breath so I weighed the pros and cons and figured it couldn't hurt too much to brush right after once.

Also, he found this. And he said, ""You sold our sex life for a reddit silver."" Lmao, guess I did."

My wife and I have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  We found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

While I was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional Asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  That rest was very short lived.  The baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

When she read ""Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  She woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  Raised with no manners or respect.  She then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

My wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  She passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

I didn't get upset because I'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

TL;DR  I labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  Now I have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks I embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days."

She’s a UX Researcher and I’m a UX/UI designer. One day (before the pandemic) I was out shopping at a grocery store and I noticed that a man I had never met before, looking at me and smiling. I started to get creeped out, returned his gaze with a glare, and hurried through my shopping. When I got to the checkout line, he hurried over to be in the same line as me, and I really started to get freaked out. Finally, while I was walking out to my car, he rushed out and at this point I’m shook. I pull out my pepper spray, point it at him, and shout “fuck off dude!”

With absolute horror and fear on his face he said “woah! I just wanted to say hi! It’s been a while and I was wondering how work was going!”

Confused and freaked out, all I could muster was a “what?”

“I wanted to ask how the UX Research Education Program is going! I really enjoyed that presentation you gave to my team and I just wanted to say that we’re starting to do unmoderated A/B tests!”

I had given research presentations to engineering teams at my company before so I started to think he worked at [my company].
“Oh my god! Do you work at [my company]?”

He looked helpless. “No... wait did you leave [twin’s company]?”

Then it dawned on me. I would have been embarrassed if it weren’t for the immediate sense of relief I felt when I realized this man wasn’t trying to wear my skin. I lowered my pepper-spray-armed hand and said “oh my god I am so sorry. You must know my twin sister [name]. I am SO sorry!!!”

“[name] has a twin???” He looked shocked and relieved.

We both ended up laughing and he apologized for his aggressive behavior. I apologized on behalf of my twin, who failed to mention I existed! Though in her defense, and my own, it’s really hard to work into a professional conversation “btw, I have a twin sister that looks just like me and doesn’t work far from here. If you think you see me out and about, be cautious. It may be my twin sister and she will pepper spray you.”

TL;DR I nearly pepper sprayed a man because he thought I was my twin sister and was being aggressively friendly, which I mistook as predatory behavior.

EDIT: thank you for all of the love! Especially the hilarious twin stories. I smiled and laughed so much reading the comments. Always amazing finding people with similar experiences.

SECOND EDIT: to all the “men” who are now “afraid” of being pepper sprayed, try to remember that it is far less likely for you to maced for being friendly than it is for a woman to be sexually assaulted. 🙂 now go suck an enthusiastically consenting BUTT"

As he finished he made the loudest groan I've ever heard. This groan sounded like a bass boosted minecraft villager played at 100 volume through headphones. 

I lost it. 

I let out a little giggle and practically sprinted to the bathroom before I exploded with laughter. He heard and asked what was so funny, and I told him I just saw a funny post on my phone and that was that.

Well that brings us to this morning. I was hoping he wouldn't say anything, but of course he had to ask what I saw that was so funny. At this point I figured I just had to tell him the truth.  So I said ""Babe, I'm really sorry, but last night you made a really funny sound and I couldn't stop."" He's a good sport so he laughed, but then he asked me to describe it to him.  I told him that he makes villager noises whenever we had sex and he became very confused. So I pulled up a video on YouTube and it DID NOT sit well with him. He told me I was lying and there was no way. I told him that I wasn't lying and that really I'm used to it at this point, but then he accused me of trying to embarrass him and told me there was ""no way he could sound like that in bed"". I didn't step down, but I did tell him it was okay. He's pissed now though. He hasn't said a word to me since and we have to leave to go to see his family tomorrow for Christmas stuff.

Tl,dr: I told my boyfriend he sounds like a minecraft villager when we have sex and now he won't talk to me."
dkm5gj,TIFU by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants,39838,0.8,6562,2019-10-20 22:18:05,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dkm5gj/tifu_by_suggesting_to_my_bf_that_he_get_testicle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dkm5gj/tifu_by_suggesting_to_my_bf_that_he_get_testicle/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"I’ve been dating this guy for a few months. He has a fetish for petite Asian girls, that I know. But he also has a thing for big breasts, which I attribute to his “hentai porn” fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

In the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. He would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me I’d be “perfect” if I got some saline implants to fill a DD cup, as a “joke” of course. (DD is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34C, but still insulting to me.)

So I finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. I told him most petite Asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. He did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great I’d look in a double D while we were out having brunch. 

So I snapped, and I said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. Well he didn’t take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. He hasn’t returned any of my texts since. 

TL;DR: I underestimated how fragile my bf’s ego is concerning his balls and I insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

Edit/Update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. I tried calling him to apologize since he’s ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

More Edit: I’m very sorry if I gave the wrong impression of him here. Words are very limited. He really is a good guy otherwise. I know and I hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. But I really like him (AND his balls big or small!). I did not mean to hurt him this deeply and I’m just so sad right now that I hurt him this much. I feel like a terrible person. I shouldn’t have reacted with cattiness that I didn’t even mean because I like his balls just the way they are!

One last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. Not sure where this will go but I guess I’ll see."

We always buy popcorn or whatever the boy scouts are selling since my son was once a boy scout and was a great salesman and won lots of prizes for his sales. So the boy scouts in the neighborhood can always count on us buying a few boxes from whoever shows up at the door.

We have three dogs. Two of them go into a barking frenzy when anyone rings the doorbell. To combat this, we keep a water gun by the door since being squirt a couple of times shuts them right up. One day, the doorbell rings, the dogs go into their frenzy, and my wife notices that the squirt gun is not sitting by the front door but had been moved to the kitchen. So she yells “It’s boy scouts. Get the gun!” to my son in the other room. 

When she opened the door the two boys were about to bolt until they see the small purple water gun in her hand.

TL;DR Boy scouts at our front door thought they were going to be met with deadly force.

Edit: Thanks for all the generosity! [Dog tax.](https://i.imgur.com/tOHmu5r.jpg) They hate being squirt but get into water whenever they have a chance, even in the middle of the winter. Spike is the cairn terrier. He's over 15 years old and has never barked at people or the doorbell. Pepper is the schnauzer, and a true watch dog since he's a yapping machine. Annie was a starving stray we found living under a bridge about 7 years ago. She is likely part basenji since although she barks, especially when Pepper instigates her, she mostly whines loudly when she's excited.

[The deadly weapon.](https://i.imgur.com/nUiTeJa.jpg) Highly recommended squirt gun. It has lasted for years, goes to about 20 ft, and is accurate. I heard about it on reddit to keep cats off counters."
xdy7fk,TIFU after masturbating for 6 years straight,39823,0.79,4157,2022-09-14 15:49:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/xdy7fk/tifu_after_masturbating_for_6_years_straight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/xdy7fk/tifu_after_masturbating_for_6_years_straight/,self.tifu,0,9,,text,True,False,False,"I (28m) started having sex in my mid teens, but stopped having sex in my early 20s, specifically after my first real relationship came to an end. I was 22. I never thought it would affect me as bad as it did for as long as it did. But from 22 until recently, I've been avoiding relationships, even casual hookups. As you can imagine, I did what most people do when they're alone and horny, I masturbated. For 6 fucking years. 

A few weeks ago I finally said enough is enough and decided to start dating again. After several unsuccessful dates and almost reverting back to my antisocial ways, I managed to make a connection. She was cute, funny, covered in freckles and I loved it. Towards the end of our first date we agreed to continue the fun at her place. Based on our body language, sex was definitely on the table. One of my biggest fears was cumming almost instantly due to the 6 years of zero sex. 

However, the opposite became my biggest challenge. I wasn't cumming at all. I could practically see the seasons change while I was fucking. That's how long it felt. After thrusting longer than I've ever thrusted in my life, I pulled out and apologized to my date. She seemed as relieved as I was to stop. We were both complaining about being sore. I explained my 6 year situation and made her understand that she did nothing wrong. It was all me. 

She understood and said it must be ""death grip"". I never heard of it before, but when she explained it to me, it made sense. I Googled how to overcome death grip and the number one treatment plan was masturbate less. I opted for not masturbating at all and guess what? It didn't help. No money shot. I had sex with the same freckle-faced girl for 3 weeks and I think her vagina fucking hates me. Yesterday we were supposed to meet up but she called to tell me she's no longer interested in seeing me because I've made it uncomfortable for her to walk properly. 

I masturbated this morning just to see if I can still cum and the answer is yes. I've literally trained my dick to hate sex and now I seemed to have lost a potential girlfriend. 

Tl;dr Avoided sex and masturbated for most of my 20s and now I'm unable to orgasm during sex and I'm losing potential relationships in the process.

**SHE CAME. HOLY FUCK. I didn't think that information was relevant until I summoned the council of female pleasure in this thread.**"

But my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

Sidenote: This happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

I work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. I had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. He was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes I get who tend to speak down to me just because I'm a girl who works in a hardware store. Anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so I said I could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. He agrees and he opens his wallet and I notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. Trying to make conversation I decide to comment on it:
(OP: Me | OG: Old Guy)

OP: Oh is that your granddaughter? She's so cute!

OG: Oh no... That's my daughter.

*FUCK, I basically just implied this guy was old.*

OG: Oh cool! She's really cute! What grade is she in?

*Guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

OG: She's dead. She was hit by a car. A week after the picture was taken 

In my mind I FUCKING PANICKED. I literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. And this is what I came up with:

OP: Oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! It's too bad she died!

The guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. In record time I get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""Have a nice day!"" And he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

Guys. 

I told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

And that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" That's what my fucking brain came up with. 
FML.

TL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**UPDATE: Holy shit.**

I did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). Appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

To answer a few comments: 
*Why didn't you just say 'I'm sorry' and move on?*

Because that would of been the smart thing to say and as I have referenced, I am a complete and utter dumbass. Also, I am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so I was trying to backpeddle as fast as I could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*Why would you comment on the kids picture? That's weird.*

Yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. But like I said I am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. This happened when I was still pretty new to the job and I had never worked in retail before so I wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. After this happened I learned my lesson and I have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*Why do you work in customer service? You clearly don't belong in that department.*

Like I said this happened a few years ago when I was still pretty new and I have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. I now train people for the job and I am also a assistant supervisor of the department. I usually tell newbies this story when I am training them so they don't make the same mistake as I did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). Also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*Did you ever apologize to the guy?*

No, and that's the one thing I regret most of all. I've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. I truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

Anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. While I'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

TL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead."

Bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!

So we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.

I thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

About an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

I turned to the man next to me and asked when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

It was at this moment I realised I was not going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

TL;DR: bought tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers thinking it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Edit: changed “bought two tickets one for me and one for my ex gf” to “bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time)” to let redditors know I am now single and available."
fd5lql,TIFU by putting “I Voted” stickers on my boobies,39759,0.71,1496,2020-03-04 07:21:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fd5lql/tifu_by_putting_i_voted_stickers_on_my_boobies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fd5lql/tifu_by_putting_i_voted_stickers_on_my_boobies/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"
This happened just a few hours ago. Using my actual account because my husband will know it’s me and there’s no way around this embarrassment. Hi sweetie. 

On with the fuck up. It’s my first time voting and I’m dropping off my ballot. I’m thinking about how nice it is that I did my part as a citizen, and oooohhh stickers! I took more than one and I noticed the large circle was about the same size as my areolas. The wheels in my head start to turn. I get home and strip all my clothes off. I’m feeling quite patriotic as I censor my teets with these sticky knockoff nipple covers. 

While my husband is on the phone, I lift up my bra to show off my work. He makes a face. I know this face. I’m reeling him in. I push a little further. I squeeze them together, wiggle them a little, and do whatever necessary to get the D. He hangs up the phone and gives in to my tempting ways. I start to go down on him for a while. Then I move to give him a taste of what’s underneath the sticker. I start to peel it off. FUUUUCK. 

That shit is STUCK on there. Trying to keep a brave face, I lift it again, but the sticker has latched on to my nipples like a baby. Should I rip it off like a bandaid? Sweet lady liberty NO! Ladies, do not rip anything off your nipples. Actually, take my advice and don’t be stupid enough to put stickers on your nips in the first place. I end up hopping in a hot shower praying they come off. One of them rips in the middle down my nipple. When I pull on both, my nipple is stretch sideways almost bringing me to tears. After taking the time to slowly lift it, it finally comes off. I will now treat them extra special and put oil on them or something. Never again. Not even to get dicked down. 

The foredaddies of this country, would be ashamed.

TLDR; I put I Voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband’s pants. It was painful to remove. Don’t do this no matter how sexy. I regret all of my decisions from the past 2 hours.

Edit: My top post is a fuck up about my boobs lmao! Thank you for my first awards internet friends 💛
I would like to address some things. 
1) I’m married, so no I will not send pics of my breasts. I ask kindly that stop messaging me about it. 
2) Believe this story is real or don’t. I couldn’t care less. I know it happened and I don’t need anonymous people on the internet trying to discredit my story. I’m sure lots of you have more important things to do than cry to the mods over this.  
3) Sorry if my 5 erotic sentences awakened something in you or offended you. I would suggest putting away your torches and pitchforks and moving on. 
4) If people are so adamant on trying this out, fine. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. I used those big red circular stickers in Utah. The O in voted has an image of the state of Utah around it and a checkmark in a box on the bottom. I kept it on for like 20 minutes total and put them on when they were soft and unaroused. I’m not sure how true this is, but i’m pretty sure women have more sensitive, pliable nipples than men. At least that’s the case for my husband and I. Maybe I just have very sensitive nipples. I don’t know. So I don’t think this would work for everyone. Anyways, enjoy. You’ve learned nothing."

What should I tell them. Or should I tell them at all? They are anti cannabis.

Help.

Update: My father found a joint in the ash tray and I just said it's from my friends. He said that cannabis is a shit drug and doesn't want me to smoke this ""shit"". Well if he would know that he just had a piece of ""shit"" cake...

Update 2: My father is going around our house with a candle and Christian church songs. I'm holding my laugh back

Update 3: My mom just made burgers for us and my dad never ate a single one apart from those like from McDonald's (2 times). He said that it's the most delicious thing he has ever eaten.

Update 4: My dad is just chilling right now and talking with my mum. My mum, I think, hasn't felt anything. 
Will update tomorrow. Good night folks. 

Update 5: I talked a little bit with my parents and they don't seem to suspect anything. Guess I got away.

TL;DR at the bottom

My dad is out of town so I’m home alone this week. I was up really late because I fucked up and didn’t do this assignment that was due in the morning. 

I was starting to get really tired so I decided to get a little hit of caffeine. I went down to the garage because we have an extra fridge there and I grabbed a soda. I walked back to the door to go inside but the door wouldn’t budge. 

This is when I realized I fucked up, because not only did I just lock myself out of the house with no shirt, no keys and no phone. I also failed to remember that my home security system was armed. 

Right as I finished that thought: 

“WooooOOOOOooo WooooOOOOOooo!” 

My surprisingly loud security system went off (there’s a 30 second delay to allow someone to punch in the security code before it goes off).  I start panicking and trying to force the door open so I can shut the alarm off. I realized that wasn’t gonna work and just started pacing and freaking the fuck out. It took longer than I’m proud of realize that I’m in a garage and I can just open the garage door. 

After I raised the garage I ran to the front door and... locked. Of course. Fortunately for me though there’s 3 other doors on the side and back of the house that I could get into the house from, unfortunately for me those too were locked. I defaulted back to stress pacing until I decided fuck it, the cops will be here soon and maybe they can help me. Well, I was half right. 

I open the side gate and walk back to the front of the house when all the sudden someone screams at me “STOP! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!” I freeze up in fear because I’m realizing that two cops who are responding to a home invasion are now pointing a gun at me, the weird shirtless guy coming from the backyard. 

I complied with their orders and explained that I live here, I just set off the alarm and locked myself out. They looked up the homeowner, my dad, and gave him a call. Needless to say, my dad wasn’t too happy to be receiving a call from the police at 2am asking if the dumbass who locked himself out of his own house was his son. 

Once they were satisfied that I lived there, one officer brought out this device that just sort of popped the door open for me. I thanked them, shut the alarm off, and used the adrenaline coursing through my veins to bust out the remainder of my homework. 

TL;DR: I was home alone late at night and got a drink from the garage, not realizing that I locked myself out and that I just set off the alarm. While I was trying to find a way into my house the police showed up and pointed a gun at me, thinking I was trying to break in."

So my fiancée and I live together in our house and because of the whole quarantine thing, she was worried about her mother being all alone so we invited her to stay with us and she agreed. A bit awkward at first but she's good company and passed the awkward stage within two days.

Yah so I woke up this morning and my fiancée wasn't in bed but I could hear the shower in our bathroom. Feeling a bit frisky, I decided to join her and maybe play around a bit. Got fully naked and ready to go. I opened the door and the speakers in the bathroom were playing music and then it hit me. Maybe I should tiptoe in and seductively start kissing from behind like in the movies. It looks hot there so maybe it'll be the same in real life right? So I stealthily made it into the shower and wrapped my arms around 'my fiancée'. When she screamed I just started laughing (second wrong move) and said in a deep voice, ""it's just me baby"" and tried again. It was only when she shouted my name and told me to get the fuck out I realized that it was actually her mother. Since I'm a slow idiot, I just stood there for about 5 seconds just staring at her as she covered herself before apologizing and running out.

I'm sitting in my car in the garage right now typing this and I still don't know where my fiancée is or why the fuck her mother was showering in our private bathroom instead of the house bathroom. So that's my life right now and I don't know how I'll live through this.

Tl;dr I woke up and thought I should join my fiancée in the shower but it turned out to be her mother. My life is over.

EDIT: I didn't realize it wasn't my fiancée sooner because the both of them literally look like sisters. Her mother doesn't age at all and they share the same hair color and body type(for lack of a better word).

UPDATE: After spending the past hours across the street with my friend building up confidence, I finally went back home and found both of them sitting on the couch. I first went up to kiss my fiance and greet her but she sort of turned her cheek as I came (I was bloody sweating bricks at this point) and said something around the lines of ""So my mother says you two had quite the morning"". *Holy shit*, I can't even explain how scared I was since they both looked serious so I just started explaining my side of the story. When all was said, they both kind of looked at each other then broke into laughter. Apparently her en suite's shower had terrible pressure this morning so my fiance said she could try ours.

So basically we're back in the awkward phase and her mother can barely look me in the eye and though my fiance says she's fine with it and understands, I can tell she's a bit angry/disturbed by the fact her mother and we saw each other naked and also that I didn't realize it wasn't her soon. Needless to say I'll never surprise my fiance in the shower ever again."
dq934a,TIFU buying my son’s Halloween candy away from him,39578,0.96,1190,2019-11-02 01:01:30,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dq934a/tifu_buying_my_sons_halloween_candy_away_from_him/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dq934a/tifu_buying_my_sons_halloween_candy_away_from_him/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"My kids go trick or treating. We live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

When they’re young we tell them Santa brings every boy and girl a present on Halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he’d leave in exchange. 

When the kids get old enough to realize Santa is a hoax, that’s when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

Did this with our oldest two and it worked great. They’d give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

Our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the Santa thing. We explained the new deal. 

He said “So then it’s my money and I can buy *whatever* I want with it? A new skateboard even? *Anything*?” “You bet.” “Swear?” “Yep.” 

He goes and brings us **all** his candy. Even every Kit Kat, his favorite. I was shocked, but he’d been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must’ve decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

Getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 I’d spent all week. 

Next day I brought the candy to work. Then we went to Walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. We met at the check out. 

There’s my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred Kit Kats for $10.00. 

I started to tell him to put it back, but he said “What? You said I could buy *whatever* I wanted! You swore! I want my candy back then.” 

His candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. And I did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

So... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

I don’t know who’s more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. 

*tl;dr I bought my son’s Halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. He spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*

wovplg,TIFU reading a manuscript my ex gf wrote,39521,0.88,4625,2022-08-15 15:32:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/wovplg/tifu_reading_a_manuscript_my_ex_gf_wrote/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/wovplg/tifu_reading_a_manuscript_my_ex_gf_wrote/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"A few days ago I (28m) got an email from my ex gf (25) with the subject line: ""I did it thanks to you!"". The email had an attachment. The attachment was a manuscript. The manuscript was an autobiography written by my ex gf. The title of the autobiography instantly took me back to the time when my ex gf and I were still dating. 

I was sexually inexperienced back in those days whereas my ex gf had more than enough sexual experience. We enjoyed talking about past relationships and what the sex was like. It was never ""a thing"" in our relationship. Just casual conversation. My ex gf had more stories to tell and all of them were entertaining. I remember joking about how she should someday write a book. We laughed, made love, and a few months later, our relationship came to an end. It was sad, but alas, life continued. 

We're now back in the present. I finished reading the manuscript an hour ago. There were 72 chapters. Each chapter was about an individual person my ex gf had known sexually. No real names were mentioned. Only character labels. Like The Surfer, The Biker, The Jock, The Older Man, etc. Some of the stories and ""characters"" I actually remembered based on the details my ex gf shared with me during our relationship. Others were totally new. But new or not, it was fun to read. Until I made it to Chapter 39. My chapter. ""The Turtle"". 

Keep in mind, all the sexual partners my ex gf mentioned in her manuscript had something specific about them that made the sex memorable for her. For example, The Surfer always smelled like the ocean, which never failed to turn her on. The Biker had gang tattoos from the neck down, but the one tattoo that always made her rip his clothes off was his pet hamster tattoo. Then there was me. A guy who couldn't swim, let alone surf, no tattoos, and with practically zero sexual experience at the time. What was so memorable about me? 

Well, according to my chapter, the answer was my ""adorably small penis"". My ex gf described how she had almost forgotten what it felt like NOT to choke during oral, before she met me. She compared my penis to the head of a baby turtle, thus my chapter and character name. Based on what I was reading, not only did I have the smallest penis compared to all the other people she's dated, but I also had the only penis that somehow managed to look ""too innocent"" for sex. 

It didn't come across as if my ex gf was purposefully trying to insult me, but come on, I think most people can understand what a sensitive topic penis size can be to any guy who's not hung like a horse. I still need to contact my ex gf and provide my feedback, but I'm gonna need some time to process what I read. It's not every day someone writes a book about your small dick. Welcome back, insecurities I didn't think I would have at this age. 

TL:DR Jokingly encouraged my ex gf to write a book about her adventurous sex life when we were still together. She wrote a manuscript years later and recently sent it to me. To my surprise (and horror), I was in said manuscript, and so was my ""adorably small penis""."
jd1eq4,TIFU Letting my wife know the meaning of a phrase i would whisper into her ear.,39505,0.84,1201,2020-10-18 00:55:01,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jd1eq4/tifu_letting_my_wife_know_the_meaning_of_a_phrase/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jd1eq4/tifu_letting_my_wife_know_the_meaning_of_a_phrase/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,,False,"Standard not today, but 4 yrs ago.

So when my wife and i first started dating (7yrs now) she was fairly naive to the world. She grew up in a strict southern Baptist environment and was never allowed to date, watch certain things, etc. etc.

She moved out of her parent's house in 2013 at 21yrs old. I met her 7 yrs ago on oct. 28th. We started talking and messaging each other things fairly quickly and getting frisky. 

Now I've never done this with anyone else, but because she was very innocent to various pop culture references i decided to give it a try. During one of our early make out sessions... without knowing a lick of french aside from Dexter's Labratory (yes my dear reader we are going there.) I proceded to whisper the phrase ""omelette du fromage"" into her ear... this turned her on immensely.

So for 3 solid years this went on until I F'd Up and told her what the phrase meant... ever since then i've regretted telling her (and she never thought to look it up) because i always got a kick out of it.

omelette du fromage = cheese omelette 

Married for 6 years this past June so i did something right!

TL:DR - For 3 solid years my girlfriend and then wife got weak in the knees to me whispering cheese omelette into her ear because she had no clue what ""omelette du fromage"" actually meant.

---------------------------------edit-line----------------------------------------

Edit: forgot to add that she in fact HATES cheese.

Edit2: Thanks for all the laughs and first awards lol. My wife and i are both laughing because we've held off on posting this, but it's a hilarious story.

Edit3: I've only seen a few (2-3) nay sayers. I can fully assure you that this is infact true. It's still hilarious to this day that i managed to go for so long and give her the feels by using a cheesy line ;)... did i mention we have 2 kids? So dad joke included at no extra charge.

Edit4: I am aware it's not actually omelette du fromage. However it's parodied from Dexter's Laboratory as i have stated above. I implore you to google or youtube omelette du fromage, and you will be enlightened.

Edit5: elvisharchercrafts is indeed my wife. Prior to today she has never been on reddit. 

* she did not create her profile to drum up business, we are both horrible at naming so she just used her business page.
* I do own a business myself, but i believe it would go against TOS to go into detail on that despite the fact that I'd love to drum up business.
* If it is against tos I'll delete because ive had a couple people ask. --- I do credit card processing and 100% elimnate fees for the merchant privately owned and large to keep them afloat, especially these days.

Elvisharcher and myself did not anticipate the huge interest of this story. It's been fun! Sadly i don't think i have many other funny stories that come to mind. I'm glad it brought a smile to quite a few of y'all!"
bxiaua,TIFU watching incest porn,39473,0.88,1512,2019-06-06 21:21:49,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bxiaua/tifu_watching_incest_porn/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bxiaua/tifu_watching_incest_porn/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. 

Me: 

I immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home. 

^^Siri ^^might ^^have ^^sabotaged ^^me

**TL:DR Drove my dad home. Accidentally blasted incest porn over the Bluetooth speaker. The end.**"

I have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  In my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions I rarely see him.  It has been about a year and a half since I have seen him and I was surprised to see him in my area today.  He has lost about a hundred pounds so I thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  I said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  He responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  We aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which I was completely expecting as I awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

When I got back into my office I brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  My office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  

TL;DR I enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer."

I was excited about the job. I love helping people. But, on the day I was supposed to start training.... I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.

The first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.

My manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named ""Georgia"" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.

My manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: ""Georgia, we're here to change you. ""

Georgia smiled and said: ""That's nice.""

Manager said: ""I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?""

Georgia smiled and said ""That's nice."" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.

My boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.

Yeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.

My boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.

Gloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.

I should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.

I vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.

Georgia just smiled and said:  ""That's nice.""

My boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: ""If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.""

I took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.

Epilogue: I'm still working there. I've not vomited into any more vaginas.

tl;dr:  If you're sick, stay home."
l7od85,TIFU by sleeping over at my new girlfriends house and taking sleeping pills,39412,0.92,1162,2021-01-29 14:58:31,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l7od85/tifu_by_sleeping_over_at_my_new_girlfriends_house/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l7od85/tifu_by_sleeping_over_at_my_new_girlfriends_house/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I (38M) am in the process of a high- conflict divorce. 5 years in the making after 8 years married. 
5 months ago I met a wonderful woman, she has been very understanding with the situation with my soon to be ex and kids. We’ve put off sleeping over since I was still living with my wife in our house. A couple of weeks ago, the court ordered my wife to move out and we now exchange the kids every week. This was her week with the kids and my girlfriend and I decided to finally have a sleepover.

Throughout the whole divorce process I have been having trouble sleeping, and have been taking sleeping pills on and off for the past 6 months. This week was particularly hard with the kids out of the house and by Thursday I had had a total 10 hours of sleep. So I go to the pharmacy to get sleeping pills. My girlfriend has already warned me she is a light sleeper and has a strict schedule of going to sleep at 10pm. So I want our first night to go well with no disturbance from me. Secondly, my experience has taught me that I need at least 3 sleeping pills to feel the effects and even then they take a few hours to kick in. Granted, I’ve never used this particular brand but I trust my experience, given that I’m 115kg and 2,01m and don’t drink or take drugs, it might be that I’m just not that responsive to sleeping agents.

So I get to her house after a tough day in the office where I had to let go of staff. I’m sleep deprived and emotionally exhausted.
We order pizza and salad and when it arrives we sit down to eat. It’s around 7pm, so I decide to take the pills then so they would have time to do their thing. We get through the salad, and by the time we get to the pizza I’m starting to feel woozy. By the end of the meal, I can’t see straight, its difficult to form sentences and I’m experiencing very strong hiccups. 

My girlfriend sits me on the couch and rubs my back to help with the hiccups, and within 20 minutes they’re gone. She helps me brush my teeth and helps me into bed. It’a just after 8pm and she jumps in the bed with me and rubs my back and arms until I’m asleep.

Next thing I know, I feel a fart coming on and just let it rip. As you can guess, it was a trick my sphincter was playing on my sleeping-pill-soaked brain and I go on to make a deposit of loose change in my underpants. I jump out of the bed and run to the bathroom. I try to quietly clean up and long story short, I go through a roll of toilet paper and ruin two hand towels and the little carpet by the toilet in the process. I get out of the bathroom and run into my very worried girlfriend pacing the hallway. I tell her what happened and she bursts out laughing, tells me not to worry and after assuring me I didn’t shit the bed as well, puts me back to sleep. 

I woke up this morning to a clean bathroom, laundered towels and underwear AND a fresh cup of coffee. She’s a keeper :)

Lesson: not all sleeping pills are equal, some  come with added sharts. 

TLDR- underestimated strength and side effects of sleeping pills and shat myself on first sleepover with new girlfriend"

Normally, during a cover lesson im a lot more relaxed since the work is usually simple and the kids know it's just trying to fill the hour. I got chatting with a couple of students about reddit and talked about a post I'd made which i thought was fairly ambiguous and buried, and totally SFW anyway. The students i was talking to were two lads, both around 14 or 15 and both pretty nice kids, who i have a good relationship with. Little did i know, one of them would go all super sleuth and track down the post. It must've taken him ages, since the post was at least 4 months old at this point, and my username contained nothing related to anything i could be identified by. A couple of days later, i see one of the lads on the corridor, and he says ""what would you if you were a girl for a day, sir?"". At first,i have no idea what he's talking about, but then his smirk helps the horror melt into my brain. A day or two previous i had rather immaturely answered that question on askreddit with ""fingerblast myself into oblivion"". After a mad dash across the school to the staffroom, which is the only place in the school that i get signal, my reddit account was no more.

TL;DR - I idiotically gave a student an in to finding my reddit, which he found, then cleverly teased me with a pretty immature and vulgar post I'd made a couple days previous, resulting in the end of my reddit account with all my sweet sweet internet points.

Edit: thanks for the awards and reimbursing my lost sweet sweet internet points. Also, as many of you have pointed out, im aware that he may see this. Oh well. Ill repost from my new account  next week and the cycle can continue"

I was working on my homework in my room, when suddenly an unrelated question came to mind. Considering my dad is pretty knowledgeable I decide to ask him for the answer. I walk into the living room where my parents are watching television. Since this is before you could simply pause your show, or at least before that technology was common, I decide to ask my dad if its okay to interrupt his show, thinking he would tell me to wait till a commercial or something.
Me: ""Dad, is it okay if I ask you a question?""
My dad stiffens and slowly turns his head to look at me. He looks a bit pale and stricken, ""W-what?""
Me: ""I was wondering, if you aren't busy, if I can ask you a question?""
Dad: ""Uh, yeah... just... go wait in my room.""
I happily go to my parents bedroom, the only other room with a TV, and turn it on as I wait.

This next part is my mom's perspective, which she shared with me years later. She was still focused on the show, unaware of my dad and I's conversation, when the TV suddenly turns off. She looks at my dad in confusion and asks whats going on. Without looking at her, he says in a shaky breath, ""Our son has... questions."" She eventually figures that my dad believes I want to ask him about sex, and that he has to give me the 'sex talk'. They spend a few minutes discussing what to talk to me about, and preparing for whatever questions I might have. She bolsters his confidence and sends him off to talk to me.

I'm watching TV in my parent's room, completely unaware of what's about to happen. My dad enters, turns off the TV, and rigidly sits on the bed next to me. He clears his throat, ""Well, son, what questions do you have for me?""
Me: ""Okay, well, are there #1 pencils? They always say 'use a #2 pencil' at school, but I've never heard of any other number. Do they exist, and how are they different?"" 
My dad slumps over onto his knees. He stares at the floor for a solid 30 seconds of silence. Finally, he takes in a deep breath and sits back up and answers my question. (For those who are curious it has to do with the quality/softness of the graphite in the pencil.)
Me: ""Okay, cool, thanks dad."" I stand up to leave, but he puts a hand on my shoulder to sit back down. ""Wait a minute, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.""
He proceeds to give me the 'sex talk'. It wasn't anything overtly graphic, focusing mostly on puberty and biological changes I can expect. But it comes so out of left-field for me that I am completely bowled over. He finishes talking and asks me, ""So, do you have anymore questions for me?"". I reply ""No, no more questions"" as i shuffle back to my room. I sit down at my desk and stare at the pencil that started this, while I can hear my mom's cackling laughter in the living room as my dad tells her what happened.

TLDR: Asked my dad a question about pencils, got the sex talk as a bonus."

We went to hs together in a small town. Both of our families are well known in the area with deep roots (both families been here a long time). Last year I got my wife a ancestry DNA kit as a gift because she wanted to know more about her European roots then her sister decided to do the same.  When their results were posted it started making family connections which included my mother, my oldest son, my uncle etc.  Wife's mom comes in the room so they ask her how we could be related. Her mom starts crying and says that when she was very young she overheard someone say ""Tom"""" isn't your father, ""Jimmy"" is. Her mom being from older generation says she just put it out of her mind and convinced herself it's just rumor.  

 I call my mom asked if she's ever heard a rumor that her father could be my wife's mother's father as well.  She gets quite for a moment and says yes I have and it was believed to be true by her mom as well and that her dad (my grandfather) was a well known cheater/womanizer. 

 We look further into the information on 23&me and it literally says that my wife and my oldest son share a great grandparent. More of us are now getting test on the same platform but it appears a WW2 Era secret has come to light.

 I wasn't aware of how prevalent this particular taboo fetish is,  some of yall are freaks. Maybe once this is settled I can have some fun with it. 

 As I stated all kids are from previous marriages, we're in our mid 40s and will not be having anymore.

 We're definitely not in Alabama but we may have to move there now.

 Yes we're very much in love and will be staying that way.  Although we probably won't be sharing this information with too many other people...guess we'll keep in the family."

I've never cared about her having acne despite her being really insecure about it. She has seen countless dermatologists and other professionals trying to get rid of it to no avail.

We have a small drying rack thing for our cleaning sponge in our bathroom. It's where a square cleaning sponge is kept and it's used to quickly clean the counters and mirrors if needed. Pretty handy right? My wife got it for us, she is so awesome coming up with these things. 

Well I was in the bathroom today and saw that my wife had bought a new cleaning sponge. But it was a super weird egg shaped sponge. I found this eggsponge hilarious and asked my wife why she would get such a weird shaped sponge and not just a normal square one. She told me it would be easier to use than the old one to put makeup on.

What. My wife uses our cleaning sponge for makeup. I don't understand. She saw the confusion on my face and asked me what's wrong. I asked her why she would use our cleaning sponge for her face.

I don't know anything about makeup. Did you know that people who wear makeup use a sponge to spread the makeup on their face? Well I didn't. But now I do, my wife made sure to explain that to me very carefully.

I had used my wifes makeup sponge for cleaning. She used that same sponge on her face and we believe that that's the reason for her reacuring acne. The wife is not happy and I feel horrible. 
I asked her why was it on a drying rack and not in her makeup bag. To let it dry out after use obviously. She didn't want any bacteria growing on the moist sponge which could happen if she left it in her bag. Great thinking! If only I didn't make it a nest for bacteria by cleaning with it.

I went out and bought her a bunch of new sponges all different shapes and sizes, but not the square ones. I hope she can forgive my dumbass soon. 

Tldr; My wife has acne she can't get rid of. I had accidentally used her makeup sponge to clean the bathroom for years. She has used that same sponge on her face and we believe that has caused her acne. I am an idiot

Edit: Thank you everyone for the skin care advice and kind words. I'll be sure to tell my wife about it all. I'm definitely going to have to buy more than just sponges for her so thanks for all the suggestions too. To answer a few questions that keep getting asked: My wife likes her privacy while using the bathroom when she gets ready in the morning. She doesn't use make up that often because apparently that's bad for her face. So I've never really seen her using her makeup sponge or then I've been too absent-minded to notice. I guess I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. The makeup sponge I had mistaken as a cleaning sponge was a square one. They come in sheets and you just take one square piece out of it, honestly just like you would take out a cleaning sponge. Thats the best explanation I have for them I hope that makes it more clear."

Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don’t feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

So I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in ‘women’ and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot. I’m not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn’t figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think “wow short hair must be the new thing” or “so many bisexuals on here” but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...”how long ago did you transition?” I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That’s when it all came together and I realized I’ve been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

Tldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole.

EDIT: I AM NOT 13 YEARS OLD, THAT’S WHEN I MADE A FACEBOOK. I AM 25."
i7lz0h,TIFU by lazily watching porn and not finding out what I was getting into before watching,39152,0.8,1908,2020-08-11 11:02:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i7lz0h/tifu_by_lazily_watching_porn_and_not_finding_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i7lz0h/tifu_by_lazily_watching_porn_and_not_finding_out/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,,False,"First off, I‘m pretty sure no one reads the related keywords for porn as long as the title and thumbnail are appealing. But if y’all do, then you’re smart. 

This has only happened once to me but after this happened... I’ll just say, I learned my motherfucking lesson and it ain’t happening again. Those titles can be a bit UN-DESCRIPTIVE as HELL apparently and I’m about to tell y’all why I now have god damn trust issues. 

I was at home relaxing and missing my man because he was at work and I was horny. So I did what anyone would do in that situation and pulled out the old iPad/vibrator combo and started scanning for hot videos. I watched a good bit of videos. Some good, some boring. But all were fine, ya know? until this one video... this one video. I won’t go into full detail on what all was in it but all you need to know for now is there was anal in it. I clicked this video bc it had a very generic title like “hardcore anal session with petite blonde Susie floozy” (not the exact name but u get the point) and a generic thumbnail. 

So, ya know, I was expecting a generic video. Either way I’m already close at this point and need to let it rip. 

It was normal, at first. and I was getting into it. I was ready to GO. You know when you’re in that perfect spot like a few moments from when you’re about to cum? Where nothing matters to you at all except what you are doing right the fuck now? The house could catch on fire and your ass ain’t moving till you finish? You aren’t mad at anything in the world. Perfect bliss and desperation. Yea, that’s where I was at.

Until it happened... that fateful moment when my orgasm became Game Of Thrones. It started out amazing and then it was taken away and quickly ruined for good. 

As this pornstar is getting piled-drived into oblivion over the couch....... 

she. starts. shitting herself. 

A lot. Everywhere. And a lot. And did I mention it was EVERYWHERE?? OR that she was shitting herself?? I froze dead in my tracks in shock and then I became even more shocked when the guy KEPT GOING... He liked it...... He started saying shit like “Mm oh damn baby you couldn’t hold it in could you?” 

...

I closed my iPad fast as hell and just sat there, cold, and dead inside. Winter had come, but not me. There was no chance it was coming back either, not after that. 

So Pornhub- There is no need to trick a bitch. When the kink is that extreme, put it in the title ffs. 

And lastly, my fellow Redditors- check the god damn tags/description on a porn next time you’re watching it. Also make sure to exit that shit out before your boyfriend gets home so he doesn’t use your iPad and then be scared to touch you for a week bc he thinks you wanna shit on his dick. 

(TIFU update: first off, I don’t have a link guys, I’m sorry :( 
secondly, I’m sorry I said “allot” lol, I’m illiterate and had no idea that was improper until I saw the comments so thank you to those of you who brought it to my attention. 
And finally, how tf did this blow up like it did?? I honestly expected this to be taken down when I posted it, I sure as hell didn’t expect 38k upvotes. You guys rock, thank you for the upvotes!)

TLDR: I tried to relax and watch porn, but didn’t properly check the tags and ended up pranking myself with shit porn, killing an orgasm and then making my boyfriend think I wanted to shit on him."
v66vzz,TIFU by letting my boyfriend eat my ass.,39151,0.75,2693,2022-06-06 21:33:12,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v66vzz/tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_eat_my_ass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v66vzz/tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_eat_my_ass/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"So my boyfriend kept telling me how excited he gets when thinking about eating ass.

I’ve always been against it but his constant repetition got me wondering what it would feel like so we decided to give it a go.

During foreplay he asked me again if he could eat my ass and I said yes.

It felt so weird, got my abs tensing up.

While licking down there 🍑 he decided to start fingering it too, the saliva was working as lube so it wasn’t painful or anything but I was feeling like I was gonna poop.

I just ignored it and was just so lost pleasuring myself with my vibrator.

When I orgasmed, I heard my boyfriend shout as if he was in pain.

I was super stressed at this point, scared I might have pooped or something.

He took he face out and stared at me. It was covered in brown watery material and he ended up throwing up on me.

Guess I got food poisoning or something and ended up diarrhoea blasting him.

…

We discussed it after he had a shower. I wanted to cheer him up so I told him I enjoyed it except the poop part. He just sat there in shock for a while and told me he doesn’t want to eat my ass again for a while.

TL;DR I tried anal foreplay and ended up pooping in my boyfriend’s mouth.

Edit: As someone pointed out - “they were basically inducing peristalsis of both the inner and outer sphincter with the fingering and vibrator. Makes ya wanna poop.”

Good to know 👍

Edit 2: People who are saying that my boyfriend is toxic and manipulative clearly don’t know him.

I let him talk about his fantasies, it turns me on.

The world isn’t black and white and adults are capable of finding something previously unacceptable to them acceptable.

Edit 3: I keep getting spam from support saying someone reached out to them.

Just to make it clear, I’m not traumatised by this experience and find it slightly funny. No need to offer me emotional support in messages either 🙂"

Yeah I get it I was a dumb kid, you don’t need to remind me.

I’ve always been a very curious person and have procured information that I often will never need. One of the best ways to gain knowledge is to ask questions, so I do, A lot. Sometimes it’s for the better, often it’s for the worse.

lets cut to the chase.

in third grade, there were 4 classes, one of these had two teachers, one for the morning, and one for the afternoon. The one we will be speaking about today is my afternoon teacher. her name was Mrs. “Virgin”

at The time, I thought a “Virgin” was someone originally from the Virgin Island, if you are from America, You’re American. If you’re from Canada you are Canadian. Britian? British. Makes sense right? So when I thought about her name, curiosity got the best of me. So I waddled up to my teacher blissfully unaware and stated the dire inquiry

Me: Mrs. Virgin, I have a question.

Mrs Virgin: Go ahead sweetie

And then, I ask it.

”Are you a virgin”

She gasps, Stares at me for a moment, Regains her composure, grabs my shoulder and says “Not an appropriate question.”

I, still unaware of what I had just asked simply said ”okay” and waddled off to the bus

As I rode home I had wondered what I had said wrong. It was in the back of my mind so I eventually forgot about it, until a couple years ago, when I remembered the story and realized what I had asked. I swore to myself I would never tell a soul, but here I am, bored and typing a story to 16.5 million people. Hope you enjoyed my suffering.

TL;DR dumb kid asks if teacher is a virgin

mqqlme,TIFU: By trying to hook up my female friend with a hot fire fighter,39085,0.86,903,2021-04-14 18:59:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mqqlme/tifu_by_trying_to_hook_up_my_female_friend_with_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mqqlme/tifu_by_trying_to_hook_up_my_female_friend_with_a/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"So many years ago like 20 years ago on a weight lifting community when I was a young teenager I befriend a guy who was a few years older then me, approx 5 years older then me. I was 13 he was 18. He gave me a lot of good weight lifting, dieting, advice and we ended up becoming gamer buddies.

Now we drifted apart for a few years and then rekindled our friendship years down the road. Going forward we will call my friend John.

When I was in mid 20s I ended up moving nearby John. I lived in a smaller town about 2 hours from him. And John and I knowing each for over a decade by this point decided to meet up

* First time I went to go see him, he showed me around his favorite spots, we ended up watching some sports at a sports bar, drinking having a good time etc.
* Second time John came down to visit me and I borrowed my dads motorcycle and John rode my bike. We smoked together, he went home
* Third time John said he was going deep sea fishing and a cousin dropped out and if I wanted to come along I could so I did

Well then a high school friend of mine who is this beautiful Asian/American woman (we shall name her Ana) got a job in Johns city. Like this woman was gorgeous. I also knew her type, she liked really musclar guys, guys who loved sports, etc.

Well Ana and I are talking on Facebook and she mentions she's single and I tell her about John, how he's a fire fighter, likes sports, is really in shape, loves to cook, etc. Ana is super excited about John and I think ""Why don't I try and hook those two up?""

So I ask her if she'd be interested in meeting John and seeing where things go, she goes YES!

So I message John and I ask one question, ""Are you single?"" He said ""yea"" and I leave it at that. So a few weeks later I have some free time coming up and I ask Ana if she'd be up for meeting John, she says absolutely. So I message John and tell him I'm thinking of coming up to his city to meet a high school friend of mine and if he wants to join us. He says yea. So we agree to meet up at a restaurant I know John likes.

Ana and I get there first, and a few minutes later John comes in. Ana whispers to me that I was right on the money and I'm thinking score, John is single, Ana is hot and succesful John going fall for head over heels. We order some drinks, and our dinner, conversation stays pretty light. We decide to go to a bar.

We get to the bar, Ana get somes drinks in her and starts getting hitting on John, she wants him. It takes John a moment and John pulls me aside and asks me ""Did you invite me to met your friend cause you wanted us to hook up?"" and I go ""Yea I did""

John hangs his head low, shakes his head looks back up at me and goes ""Dude i'm gay"" and I go ""What? Your gay?"" he goes ""Yea I'm gay"" and I ask ""Why have you never told me?"" and he goes ""Well...you never asked"" and I go ""Why haven't you mentioned any of your boyfriends?"" and he tells me that most of his boyfriends have been in the closet and they wanted to keep the relationship off social media.

At this point Ana comes over, she's fairly drunk she rubs up on John arm and goes ""I really just want you to know your super hot, and I'd love it if you took me to your bed tonight""

John looks at her and goes ""Your really pretty, but your not my type"" and Ana goes ""O you don't like Asians?"" he goes ""No, I'm gay"" Ana is standing there for a moment, processing this information looks at me and goes ""You tried to hook me up with a gay guy?"" and I respond ""I didn't know he was gay""...Ana looks at me and goes ""You've known him for like 15 years and you didn't know he was gay?"" and I go ""Yea..."" she goes ""O...wow"" she thought for a moment and said ""Well...I thought I was going hook up with you, so I need a moment I'm going go step outside""

John and I went to our table and had a good talk, he had only come out of the closet shortly after I moved nearby, and knew I was straight and liked being friends with me and didn't want to ruin our friendship over him being gay and I never asked so he never felt the need to tell me he was gay. And to be fair, I didn't care he was gay he is still a cool guy.

Ana comes back after a few minutes, and sits down and goes ""Ok, I'm new here...your gay...so we aren't going be hooking up...but like do you where the best place to shop here is?"" John laughs and goes ""Yea I can show you""

The rest of the night was good, Ana and John are still good friends. Since that night John actually met the man of his dreams, I was supposed to attend his wedding but...COVID19 makes international travel difficult.

And that folks is the story of how I tried to hook up my hot female friend with my hot male friend...and I found out he was gay.

TL:DR Tried to play match maker, found out my friend is gay.

**FAQ**

* John and I age gap?
* At first John and I didn't even know how old each of us were, and he never made any ""moves"" on me or attempted to ""Groom me"" also we were not even remotely close to each other in terms of distance. Also Johns new Husband is actually older then him. I also never met John in person until I was in my 20s. Not cause of any sense of concern or anything but that's just how things worke dout

* Why I didn't hook up with Ana? Or at least try?
* Several reasons, first being I met Ana when she started dating my best friend in high school, that's how we became friends. I don't date my friends ex girlfriends. Secondly Ana is both a perfectionist and a clean freak both of things would drive me up the wall. Thirdly I'm not her type, I'm not some big in shape guy.

* Is Ana seeing anyone?
* I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she is I don't know who. And the creepy PMs of guys trying to get me to hook them up ain't going anywhere guys...I'm not going message my friend and be like ""O some dude who I don't know messaged me on the internet and said he wants me to help him get in your pants you cool with that?"""

We have both been exploring kink with each other in ways we never have in past relationships, and it’s been a really great way for us to connect and explore our sexuality. Overall a very positive experience.

About a month ago, I brought up that it might be fun for me to give him keys to my apartment and have him “break in” at random to have sex with me. I heard some kinky friends discussing it, and it sounded so spontaneous and sexy. He agreed, and said he would come to my place at random one night. After that, I pretty much forgot about it.

Last night, he was driving home from an evening with friends and gave me a call to chat. We talked for a bit, and I heard him start getting out of his car, assuming he’d arrived home. He told me to hold on a minute, so I did. Then I heard someone fucking with my apartment lock. The door started opening, and having totally forgotten about our “plan,” I started screaming bloody murder. “Who the fuck is this?” I yelled. “Get out of my apartment!” I was sure someone was breaking in and honestly thinking I might die. My heart was just about pounding out of my chest.

He shows himself. “It’s just me,” he said, rushing to help me. I burst into tears, and he spent the rest of the night comforting me. Needless to say, we did not end up doing the deed. So much for hot, spontaneous sex.

Tl;dr: gave SO keys to my apartment so he could “break in” and have kinky sex with me, forgot about it entirely, he did it, I thought he was a burglar and pretty much lost it.

Edit: Thank you so very much for all the trinkets!"

It still gives me shivers.

Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.

I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.

A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,

""What is your most prized possession?""

I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.

So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)""

""Dong schlong. Thank you, sir.""

I was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

I've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

EDIT:

Holy mother of schlong this blew up... Thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

And yes, looking back, I should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. But this had never happened to me and I think I just panicked. I'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

EDIT2:

I (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and I was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

After about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, I turn and it's the security guard. He asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. I'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who I can't find.

Apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, I'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. I'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. She'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

TL;DR Started following a stranger who I thought was my girlfriend and creeped them out"
enook9,TIFU by telling my 35 year old wife that she looks hot in a 20 year old picture,38802,0.8,4615,2020-01-12 20:53:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/enook9/tifu_by_telling_my_35_year_old_wife_that_she/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/enook9/tifu_by_telling_my_35_year_old_wife_that_she/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened last night and I’m not sure how this is going to end.  I’d like to begin by stating I am not a perv. That being said, I may have done something pervy and I now hate myself. This fuck up is innocent enough, I think, but the implications are terrible. I’ll let you be the judge. 

So yesterday my lovely, beautiful, 35 year old wife went to her grandmothers house to help clean out her old room. She lived with her in her high school years because her mother moved away and she didn’t want to change schools, so she stayed. Her room at grandmas has gone pretty much untouched since she moved in with me, 16 years ago. Anyways, she got home late last night and was very excited to show me some of her treasures for decades past that she recovered from her childhood bedroom.  Unfortunately her show-and-tell session coincided with a playoff game so she did not have my undivided attention (even though the Titans clearly had it in the bag, you have to watch until the end just in case). She showed me her sketch book, (very nice dear, you could have been an artist) an article she wrote that was published in a local newspaper (wow babe, you coulda been a journalist... FUMBLE!) and some other stuff. Then she breaks out a dusty photo album from the good old days of disposable cameras. I got detailed history of every picture of her, her friends, her siblings, people she doesn’t even remember, places that no longer exist... I was not paying attention. I’ll admit that. She flipped through page after page as she sat beside me on the couch and I glanced at the pictures, and gave my obligatory “that’s nice” or “wow, look at that” response. 

Everything was going peachy. Until she flipped the page, and said “this is a picture of me at the beach” and I glanced. And it was her in a bikini. Her, my wife, in a bikini. I said “daaaaaamn”. And looked back at the TV. Silence from her. I feel something is wrong. I can feel her eyes on the side my face. I said the wrong thing. What did I do? I risk a peek at her face; she is shocked. I have obviously grown a grotesque second head on my shoulder, because the look on her face could not be the result of anything less. 

“What?” I ask stupidly. 

What the FUCK does that mean? I show you a picture of me when I was 15 FUCKING YEARS OLD and you say “daaaaaamn?” You find that fucking attractive?! You are disgusting! I have no answer, I just kinda look at her wishing she’d start laughing at let me know she’s fucking with me. But no, the same expression of rage and disappointment. I don’t know what to do. I kinda stuttered out “but... but it’s you! You know... younger I guess but you’re hot. I’m sorry, you’ve always been hot. What the fuck am I supposed to say? She tells me that the little girl in the picture no longer exists, that’s it’s not her but a memory and that I am a weirdo. I have nothing to say, I just want this conversation to be over. There are 4 minutes left in the fourth quarter. I get the brilliant idea to say “look, I wasn’t paying attention let me see the picture again I’m sure you aren’t hot”. Smoooooth. 

I won’t go in to too much detail about the rest of the conversation but suffice it to say that I am sleeping on the couch and should apparently be on a list of folks to keep an eye on. All I wanted to do was watch football. 

TL;DR I saw a picture of my wife taken when she was 15 and suggested she was hot.

Edit: I should add her Grandmother is being moved to Hospice care. She does not normally react this way but I think she is under a lot of stress. Also I have read your comments and agree that this has more to do with me ignoring her than me thinking she was a hottie at 15. She needs me to be there to listen to her and I blew it. Thanks for your feedback though it’s a lot to think about.

Edit 2: hooray I made the front page. I wanted to update the folks who seem genuinely interested. My wife and I talked about it, we are doing just fine now. She is not crazy, not a bitch, and we’re not getting a divorce. Some of you also suggested her reaction may have been the result of a past trauma. She assured me this is not the case, she’s just stressed and was angry with me.
Lastly, fellas... please stop suggesting that I did nothing wrong because you think it’s perfectly natural and ok to be attracted to teenage girls. It is not. I don’t care how “developed” they are. Stop it. 

Final edit: sorry if I ghosted you guys. I took (some of) your advice and have been giving my wife my undivided attention. I am not used to this amount of attention or scrutiny, and honestly it’s been a mixed bag. It’s Reddit. I asked for it. But now that I’ve got it... I feel kinda like a young actress who wanted a private meeting with Harvey Weinstein. So I’ll try to read your 4K comments and reply to anyone who I feel might me waiting for one, but not now. Thanks for your support and advice. Thank you for mocking, trolling, and ridiculing me as well, it’s all in good fun. I hope."

Since lockdown, my wife and I have found a new appreciation of the garden. It isn't big it, isnt pretty... but it's a way to get outside and, given the cabin fever we've experienced, this is a nice form of escapism. We've always had a bird feeder that we topped up periodically... but with us both working from home, we've enjoyed watching the birds come and go. We got bladk birds, starlings, magpies and more pigeons than you could count. After a while we fed them by hand and now we can even get a few of them to sit on our hand and eat. Its therapeutic in a  weird way and naturally we've named some of them and so on. I really recommend it ( #berbs )

Anyway, the wife asks a week ago if she can buy some more bird seed  - I said sure, sounds good. I should add my wife isn't from a country that uses the metric system and she's still getting used to it over here. I was in the room whilst she put the order in and - well - maybe when she said ""ooo is it ok if I get a fair bit, its cheaper that way?"" and ""ooo a selection for wild birds, shall I get some of that too?"" I didn't do my due diligence. I thought ""what the hell, its not like it goes off. We can stick it in the garage"". When she told me how much it was, I was shocked but I assumed she got a few bits with the order (again, she is still adjusting to the price of things over here and everything is super expensive to her)

So  you can probably see where this is going... this morning a delivery arrived. My first clue should have been the size of the van that pulled up outside my house, ready to deliver 4 sacks of 12.5kg of birdseed. The delivery driver, from his safe social distance, lost his shit with laughter as my mind melted as he pulled sack after sack off his van. My wife was in a zoom meeting and when I finally got her attention revealed there's still more to come that's in transit and will arrive tomorrow. Turns out, for some reason, she thought it was 2.5kg to the lb.

I don't know if you can picture the amount of birdseed we have, but I'd say -- if we take into account how much is due to arrive tomorrow-  I'll expect we have about the size of a small sofa. We have enough birdseed to last our entire lives, we can give it as inheritance after we die... from drowning in birdseed.

We've both spent a good part of the last hour crying with laughter amid our sacks. Every time I go into the hallway, I lose my shit a bit. After 6 weeks in lockdown I really think I might be losing my mind.

The best bit, we threw some into the garden and the birds don't want to know. Little bastards.  


  
TL;DR My wife bought bird seed. She didn't appreciate the nuances of the metric system and bought Pablo Escobar quanitites. The birds don't like it. My house is full of it. I can't.



UPDATE- golly, this is what it feels like when Reddit goes bananas? My phone has been going crazy... Anyway, lots of people asked for photos - regrettably, I had already started breaking the sacks down so I cant do all of it.. but here is ONE of the FOUR sacks (12.5kg) we received... cant wait for more tomorrow! 
 Annoyingly its also the most compact of the sacks we got due to smaller seeds. The one with the peanuts was immense!

Oh and for 100% honesty I'm squeezing it a bit (Because it isn't a solid mass to hold)... but believe me when I say I am satisfied I got the full amount we paid for, its a solid mass to carry. Also, hello lockdown hair!

So I’ve been with my current girlfriend for over a year a now and we got together six months after me and my ex broke up.

My girlfriend was out doing Christmas shopping today and I was having a relaxed day off of work so I decided with the place to myself to jerk off. 

Decided to put some porn on but after 40 minutes I was getting frustrated and couldn’t cum so when this happens I go to my ex’s nudes and videos she sent to me so I put some headphones and started going to one of her videos. 

My girlfriend came home but I couldn’t hear she came home so she walked over to me to get my attention or to like maybe start something clearly seeing what I was doing but she saw my ex’s face moaning on my phone and ran out shouting

She drove and isn’t answering her phone It’s been 3 hours and she still hasn’t come home what the fuck do I do to make this right

TLDR: my girlfriend of almost two years caught me jerking off to my ex’s nudes she left and I haven’t seen her

Edit: I’ve deleted all the videos and pictures and she messaged me just saying we will talk when I get home

Edit 2: Me and my GF talked so she thought I was video chatting with my ex I explained it was an old video and she said that was better than video chatting but she still was hurt so we talked it through we aren’t breaking up but I’m heading to my parents for Christmas and she’s going to hers for Christmas. I’ve given her the password to my phone and laptop and showed her they are all deleted but I’m sleeping on the couch till she feels comfortable having me in bed

Edit 3: This should be the final update we’ve decided couples counselling after Christmas would be a good idea for us moving forward. I know a lot of Redditors are gonna be mad she wants to work on things and I’m shocked she does. I feel like I’ve been given the biggest second chance ever. 
I don’t want want to recover the nudes so people please stop trying to help with that. thank you to everyone who gave me advice but I’m staying on the couch till we both get back after New Years"

She had met my family/parents and everything was good. My parents liked her. She liked my parents.

I had never even had a girlfriend or anything before (at the time I was only 18) so my parents weren’t completely used to their son having a lady over.

Anyway, so we’re upstairs in my bedroom and we start gettin a little freaky. Things escalate and we eventually start having sex. We were super quiet about it so that nobody would know. 

This is where things get ~hilariously terrifying~.

So, I’m BALLS DEEP in my gf as she’s riding me, and my dad just casually walks into my room and essentially gets a full ass view of my gfs fuckin butthole and my willy half-way up main street. He’s so startled he makes one of this “DOH!” sounds like Homer Simpson y’know??? He quickly turns away pretending like he hadn’t seen anything. This all happened in less than 2 seconds. 

I can hear my mom downstairs say “Honey? What was that?!”

My dad, god bless his soul, replies “I... uhhh... stubbed my toe...” in the most defeated way possible.

My gf couldn’t look at my dad the same way again.

I haven’t talked about it with my dad ever.

edit: I still laugh my ass off telling this story to people.

tldr: tifu by having sex w/ my gf while my parents were home and my dad walked in on us. He pretended his yelp of surprise was actually his stubbing of his toe."

Throwaway account.

My mom's been involved with this new guy for a few months now. To be fair, enough time has passed for me to stop referring to him as the new guy, but he's not my dad and I guess that will always make him feel like the new guy. According to movie logic, I'm supposed to hate him for trying to replace my father or whatever, but the truth is, I like him. I like him so much that I've been learning how to use sign language to improve our communication because new guy happens to be Deaf. 

He can read lips, which is how I've been communicating with him. My mom didn't waste any time learning sign language at the beginning of their romance and she's at the point now where she can have full conversations without using her voice. I was really proud of her and so was new guy. I'm not on their level yet, but I've had enough practice to follow a conversation that's not too complicated. My plan was to surprise new guy on his birthday, which is 2 months from now, and wish him a happy birthday as well as officially welcoming him to the family in sign language. 

However, I never factored in the amount of dirty talk my mom and new guy were having in sign language. Not knowing that I can understand them, my mom and new guy have gotten disturbingly comfortable exposing their sex life in my company. It didn't matter if we were at the dinner table or watching tv, I would constantly catch so many dirty descriptions being communicated between the two of them. They are worse than horny teenagers, and I should know, I am one. No 17 year old son should ever witness his mother use her fingers to demonstrate how wet her vagina is. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm no longer willing to wait until new guy's birthday to make it known that I can understand sign language because HOLY FUCK I need my eyes to not see this shit anymore. 

This is an ongoing fuck up.

**Tl:dr The guy my mom's dating is Deaf. Because I like the dude, I decided to learn sign language in secret and was planning to surprise him on his upcoming birthday by communicating in sign language. Little did I know that secretly understanding sign language would expose me to disturbingly intimate conversations between my mom and the new man in her life.**"

Today was an especially nice day so there were a lot of people out jogging and walking as well. As I was jogging up to an intersection a really attractive woman with a very fit butt happened to turn the corner and start walking the way I'd come. She was out walking a dog and ended up going the same direction as me. This coincidentally ended up being about the time I'd exhausted myself with jogging and started talking to catch my breath. I, being a guy, couldn't help but take notice of her very nice rear end. I wasn't trying to be a perv about it, nor did I plan on saying anything rude, I was just admiring. Well for whatever reason I happened to look over at the large dog she was walking with and was confronted with the large pair of dog danglers I've ever seen. 

The abrupt change from admiring a woman who takes amazing care of her body to these two huge furry tennis balls swaying back and forth apparently broke my mind for a short period of time. I'm guessing the woman had seen me jogging a ways behind her as she turned the corner because she moved off into the grass and looked behind her. I imagine to let me pass assuming I was still jogging and not realizing was now walking at the same pace as her. She saw me looking down and I could see her scowl a bit, thinking I was staring at her butt. (which in all fairness I had been moments before.)   


However, at that moment what she caught me staring at was her dogs obscenely large balls with what was probably a mixture of shock and awe. Her scowl immediately faded and she started laughing so hard she had to stop walking because she almost walked into a street sign. Was at a complete loss of how to respond and was tempted to say I was looking at her butt as if that would somehow help me salvage my dignity. She eventually regained her composure, I blurted out some sort of apology and used the newfound adrenaline to jog most of the way home. But that's not all! Later in the day I ran into her again...as she was entering her apartment....in the same complex as me...  As it turns out she's one of my new neighbors. FML. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr I was going for a jog/walk and ended up behind a beautiful woman who caught me staring at her dog's huge balls."

To show a bit of gratitude, I wanted to cook for her so I decided to go for something simple like a Chicken katsu.

I've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. This is the moment I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs so I have to go to the convenience store to get some. I am somewhat decent in Japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? No.

As I walked in the store, I couldn't find the breadcrumbs I was looking for so I decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

Me: ""Sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

At this point I didn't realize that I mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". The staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking I was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. I repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. After the change of the staff's expression, I realized that I fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. I then explained that I mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

TL;DR I mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy"

When I was 17, I went to Ireland with my parents. We were there over my birthday, and I decided I wanted to get my nose pierced to celebrate. My mom and dad asked the hotel concierge where we could get it done, they recommended a place, and off we went.

As soon as we walked in the door, we realized it was a sex shop. We were surrounded by hardcore fetish gear, toys, and porno dvds. But a worker greeted us brightly and confirmed that they indeed did piercings in the back. 

My parents were permissive and liberal when I was a kid, so they just kind of shrugged, giggled with me, and let the guy lead us through to the back. A heavily tattooed, outrageously attractive woman pierced my nose, and although I did not yet know I was a lesbian, I was certainly *interested* in the way she apologized for the pain by saying, “Sorry sugar!” in her lovely Irish accent. 

Piercing complete and a bit woozy, I walked back into the sex shop to find my parents, and spotted my dad standing in front of a wall of dildos.  

“Checking out the dildos?” I joked, but to my dismay the man who turned to face me was not, in fact, my father. 

This poor random Irish guy took a look at me and said uncomfortably, “I’m just looking around.” Keep in mind that although I was 17, I am 4’ 11” and looked about 12, so from this man’s perspective an actual child had just interrupted his sex toy browsing to question him about his behavior. 

Mortified, I threw up my hands and said what came to mind first, the most situationally absurd sentence of my life, “Oh my god, I’m so sorry—I thought you were my father!”

As the man’s face contorted in horror, the implication of what I had just said hit me, and I fled. I found my parents and shooed them out of the store. I told them what had just happened and they laughed all the way back to the hotel. 

Tl;dr My parents accidentally took me to a sex shop to get my nose pierced, I jokingly asked a man I thought was my father about browsing dildos, the man was not my father and I apologized by implying that my father and I were shopping for sex toys together.

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the awards! I’m glad this silly story made y’all laugh."
nbau1r,TIFU by faking a British accent for 12 years,38434,0.89,1963,2021-05-13 12:47:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nbau1r/tifu_by_faking_a_british_accent_for_12_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nbau1r/tifu_by_faking_a_british_accent_for_12_years/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This happened in high school at a summer band camp. I did not know anyone at this camp and I flew in from out of state. 

When I left the airport my best friend called me and we were talking. I had an inside joke with my best friend where we would just talk to each other in random accents for no reason. This time I was talking to her in a British accent. Little did I know that a group of people from my summer camp were standing right next to me waiting for the camp’s bus to pick us up. 

I get off the phone and one of them asks if I’m here for the camp too and I say yes. He then asks me where I’m from and tells me that my accent is so “cute”. I had really bad social anxiety in high school and in my anxiety mind I thought this dude would think I’m weird for faking an accent. He was also cute which made me more nervous. 

I totally panicked and just said, “England”. Then he asked me what part and I said, “London”. Then, thinking he’d ask if I flew in from abroad, I said I was raised in London and then moved to the US. That was where the lies started but not where they ended.

The entire bus ride to the camp this guy was talking to me about british TV shows like Doctor Who and I keep faking the accent. So we get to the camp and by now I’m thinking I HAVE to come clean and say it was just a bad joke, but for some reason my anxiety is going NO DONT DO THAT ITS TOO LATE YOU ARE BRITISH NOW. 

Everyone in the bus had heard my accent and me talking about how much I love Doctor Who and the London theater (never been). So for the entire TWO MONTHS of this camp I pretended to be British. I even watched YouTube videos on how to fake a better accent and words to say to sound more British. 

That guy and I become friends and we kept in touch. I never came clean. It’s been TWELVE YEARS. For a while we kept in touch a lot and would FaceTime and I’d fake the accent. We aren’t as close anymore but we still talk over Snapchat sometimes and whenever I send him a Snapchat when I’m talking I have to fake the accent. At this point I think I’m stuck being British forever to him. He can never meet my other friends or family. He lives in a different state but if he ever visits where I live I guess I’m faking the accent. I wish I had never faked the accent.

TLDR; Panicked and ended up faking a British accent at a summer camp in high school where I made a friend who I kept in touch with. It’s been 12 years and he still thinks I’m British.

UPDATE— Wow I did not expect this to blow up and I’ll try to respond to more comments after work. I answered the dialect question in the comments but it’s buried and people keep asking so: 

I didn’t pick a dialect but I did have the brilliant idea to say my dad was French Canadian and we spent a few summers in Canada when I was growing up. I thought this would explain it if my accent sounded off to anyone because I would’ve grown up hearing his accent too and taken on some of it. Obviously looking back on it now that wasn’t as clever as I thought at the time lol

UPDATE #2 - I did it. I sent him this post and told him. Turns out he sorta figured it out years ago because he saw my dad post something on my Facebook page that made him suspicious, he did some googling and quickly figured out my dad had always worked in the US. My dad is a university professor so his cv/work history is easy to find online. There are even videos of my dad talking at conferences, clearly with an American accent. 

Anyway my friend said he suspected for years and just didn’t want to embarrass me and thought it wasn’t worth bringing up because we weren’t super close anymore when he figured it out (Nothing romantic ever happened between us btw, I just had a slight crush on him that summer. We’re both actually married now). 

I apologized for lying to him and he said it’s fine but he’s never letting me forget this and I have to do the accent if we see each other in person again lol. I’m glad I came clean but I still feel really bad and embarrassed about the whole thing. Honestly I’m sure I’ll be cringing to myself about this for the rest of my life lol"

In the past month or so Ive hit a bit of a slump emotionally. 

I havent reslly done much lately but binge Read Dead Online trying to gring my level up. I dont have social media other than Reddit. And I honestly cant recall seeing any articles about any hurricane. I also dont have cable, just paid services like amazon prime and netflix.

Finally, a few hours ago I ran across an article about a hurricane headed for Louisiana. I looked it up on Weather. Com and it now appears I am in the unsurvivable zone of a storm surge. 

So not sure what to do at this point.

TL:DR- Isolation due to Covid, depression, and video games made me oblivious to the fact that a hurricane was headed directly for me. Now its too late to leave

UPDATE: 

- A friendly redditor dm’d me the location of a gas station that still had gas. This allowed me to gas up while the eye was over Lake Charles and the storm wasnt so bad.

- Ive made it 3/4 of my way to Shreveport where I will be staying, out of harms way. The storm is bad but im ahead of it now

Frequently asked questions:

- My phone battery. I honeslty wasnt without power that long before I left, and I have this cylinder shaped thing that you plug into the wall and charge and then its like a portable charger and you just plug your phone into it, and its like a whole new charge.

- Did I really play RDR2 that much? Unfortunately yes. I got lost in finding collectibles and leveled up to 70 in a few days

- Was there no emergency text sent out to my
Iphone? You know I started thinking about this after someone mentioned it, and it seems like my phone did go off at like 11:30pm last night or the night before, but i didnt read it because I thought it was an Amber alert and I was asleep.

- Did I get drunk on American Honey? No, i took like one slug off of it before communicating with the gas guy and then I knew i would be leaving soon.

- Why did I go back home? After finding no gas, i was too afraid of getting stranded in an unfamiliar place in a storm. I thought mt chances would be better in a place I knew and where I had my things at my disposal.

Thank you all for the concern, advice, and words of encouragement. Rest and know that I am safe and will be more aware of current events in the future."

Anyways, so thanks to a no-show, I ended up taking over for the hostess. The duties are simple for reserving tables, write down the name, number of adults and children, and the estimated wait time. We get about two hours into my shift, and we're rapidly growing our list. I'm doing my usual, making small talk, big smiles, 'how's your day, jeez look at that weather, we'll be ready for you in ten minutes' yadda yadda. Then this humble looking father strolls on up, he's polite, and asks for a table for two. I jot down his name with a smile and reply with the sentence that will stay with me until the last molecule of my maggot-ridden corpse finally rots away: 'And one kids menu, yeah?'

Suddenly his brow furrows, and he looks like he's ready to tear me apart. Now I'm 6'2 190lbs, never feel threatened by anyone, but the look on this previously soft humble man's face put the fear of god into me. As I stood there confused, contemplating what I was rapidly assuming could be my last moments on Earth, he leans in close and utters a simple sovereign: **'No.'**

As my brain rattles around in my skull trying to piece together what he is aggressively objecting to, my peripherals finally decide to do their job and draw my brain's attention to his child.

She's not a child at all, she's his wife, and *she's a dwarf.*

She's refusing to even make eye contact with me, she's just fighting back tears and looking sheepishly away.

I can't even.. I'm literally just frozen. It's like my entire body was trapped in a factory reset for what seemed like ten solid seconds.

Once I realize how long I've just been staring at them like a frog, I manage to regain control of my body, and open my mouth to try and formulate some sort of panicked spastic defense, but the pair swiftly turn away and disappear into the crowd like Hannibal Lector at the end of Silence of The Lambs. I'm just standing there staring at the spot they once were, suddenly finding the air horrifically thin, as I wait for my eyebrows to return from the back of my head.

So yeah, I definitely ruined this poor woman's night, if not her week, I have no way to rectify my actions, and I am at an utter loss for words.

tl;dr- I mistook a dwarf for a child and offered her a kids menu."

I believe the removal of the ""NSFW only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

When you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

TL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule. These post clearly have their audience so I have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. However I don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day."

Frustrated, I shot back with ""How about I pay you $445 to suck my dick and we'll call it even?"". Satisfied I hung up and went back to work. About half an hour later I get a call from my mom, I am fresh out of college so she still manages my home owners insurance, asking why I just offered the State Farm agent money to suck my dick. Turns out that wasn't a scammer and instead was a legitimate agent trying to tell me my policy was about to be cancelled because I forgot to pay my bill. Whoops.

Cue an awkward phone call apologizing to my female agent and trying to explain that I wasn't trying to sexually harass them.."
fitst4,"TIFU: After accidentally buying way too much toilet paper for years, I finally ran out. THIS WEEK.",38350,0.92,920,2020-03-15 07:21:49,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fitst4/tifu_after_accidentally_buying_way_too_much/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fitst4/tifu_after_accidentally_buying_way_too_much/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This is a FU that is three years in the making, culminating today.

A few years back I started buying toilet paper on Amazon subscription. But my kid had just moved out so I apparently overestimated how much to buy so it didn't all fit in the linen cupboard. My darling spouse started storing the extra in the garage. But I didn't know this as I never go in there.

So I kept looking in the linen cupboard and seeing we only had a few rolls. And then increasing the subscription. And even buying extra packs one-off because I thought we were out. And spouse kept stashing it all in the garage without me knowing. After almost 2 years of this, he finally begged me to stop buying TP because we were running out of room to store it! So for the past year and a half I have not bought TP at all. As all the coronavirus panic was building I thought, ""well at least my earlier stupidity means we don't have to fight crowds for TP, as I am sure we have enough. We will NEVER run out! We can share with all our friends and neighbors!""

Well, turns out we actually had FINALLY gotten through the huge backlog of TP. And as luck would have it, the first time I genuinely need to buy TP in well over a YEAR, it's this week. FML.

I suppose the bright side is I was equally stupid about subscriptions for wipes and paper towels, so I have been able to give those away to needy neighbors.  They all think I am brilliant and prepared. They have no idea it's just because I am dumb.

EDIT: to the 60+ people that mentioned I should get a bidet, yes, I agree. Except I do live in a severe drought area. Also, the garage is detached from the house and not where the car goes, and is used for storage only. None of my stuff is in there. Mostly camping stuff and my kid's stuff they didn't take to school. And even if I did go in there, the TP was out of line of sight. So no, I really didn't see the stack for years.  Spouse and I talk plenty, but just not about TP!  ;-) He trusts me to buy stuff and I trust him to put it away when it arrives. We just got too good at our jobs! Plus he's a little bit of a prepper so he didn't think to ask me to stop until we had a LOT, lol!  And for the weirdos who need to know: about 2 rolls per week. Yeah, that's a lot, but there are medical reasons. And lastly, I am amazed how many other people on here have had the exact same type of accidental hoarding experience. And how many ran out at equally inopportune times. I feel better knowing I am not alone. 

TL;DR: After three years of accidentally having a surplus of TP, I happened to run out entirely THIS week and can't find more to buy."
azdtay,TIFU by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that I had to be rescued. Then I did something really embarrassing.,38262,0.9,949,2019-03-10 14:08:22,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/azdtay/tifu_by_going_to_the_gym_and_immediately_pinning/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/azdtay/tifu_by_going_to_the_gym_and_immediately_pinning/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"


A few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

I suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.

I was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.

I saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

It was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

The bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.

*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

Nope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.

""Hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*

To his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.

So, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*

**Fuck.**

**Me.**

The door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.

I can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. I just wanted to look like a normal human being.

TL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will."

Golden age of fuck ups.* 

I hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

So thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the Deacon's daughter. 

*Edit: Thank you for the Silver & Gold!* 

*Edit: Okay, gawd damn. Some of you are sick of all the sex posts. Noted.* 

*Edit: A few of you are asking how my old man reacted. Every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of God. Being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. I was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the Bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in Christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. I never had sex with the Deacon's daughter ever again.*

**TL:DR Made ungodly love to a Christian girl. She went crazy with guilt and confessed all our filthy fornicating to the pastor of our church. Aka my dad.**"

So I’m at home for a little, sitting in my room, browsing YouTube as one does. Suddenly my dad bursts in the door and tells me he has to show me something.

I’m like “what” and he tells me I have to come look at the TV. There’s a lot of crazy news on these days, so I’m like “what’s up.” He tells me that CNN is doing a report on the stock market and it’s hard to explain, but he wants me to come take a look at it. Right now. He emphasizes that I have to come quickly. 

Normally, I wouldn’t have wanted to see, but I figured maybe something interesting has happened, like happened to GameStop earlier this year. Plus, it couldn’t really hurt, and I wasn’t doing anything anyways. So I decide to humor him, get up, and follow him to the living room. 

I am immediately greeted by 4 realizations:

1. The TV is on, but it’s not playing CNN

2. It is in fact MTV doing a throwback night. They’re playing 80’s music. 

3. The Never Gonna Give It Up music video is been playing.

4. I have been rickrolled by my father. 

Fuck.

Turns out my brother had told him about the meme, and I was the unfortunate victim of his first attempt. The most old fashioned rickroll I’ve ever seen, and I have to give him credit for it. 

TL;DR: Dad told me I had to come look at a stock report CNN was playing. Turns out it’s MTV and he rickrolled me."

It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

It was our first Valentine's Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

I decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

I needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

This is when things begin to go wrong.

All of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


Sure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

We're both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

Fight or flight kicks in and I know I must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. I'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. So when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, I go balls to the walls.

I grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*CLACK*


Once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. I drive him to the hospital
And sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
So not only, on our FIRST Valentine's Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder. 

TLDR: Had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs."

I got his attention and jokingly pulled one boob out of my bathing suit top which is pretty normal for our relationship and didn’t realize his mom had come out of the bathroom and was almost directly next to me. She made a shocked face, he started cracking up, and I wanted to die. Needless to say, I won’t be flashing him with anyone around jokingly or not for a very long time.

TL;DR flashed my boyfriend one boob for a laugh and accidentally flashed his mom as well

ETA: just wanted to say thank you guys for the awards, I didn’t know everyone would get such a kick out of my one boob wonder."
w2t0n4,TIFU by letting a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She was a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to sit on my sofa and masturbate,37987,0.92,1402,2022-07-19 19:09:52,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/w2t0n4/tifu_by_letting_a_delirious_woman_into_my_house/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/w2t0n4/tifu_by_letting_a_delirious_woman_into_my_house/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"This happened yesterday in the UK while we are going through the hottest heatwave on record. It's 4PM and I'm minding my own business in my back garden tidying my shed when i hear somebody trying to get into my back gate. I peek through the gap to see an elderly woman looking very hot and distressed, she notices me and starts shouting please help me, please help me. I can't open the gate, so I tell her to go to the front door. I ran through the house and told her to come in and take a seat while I get her a glass of water.  She's mumbling gibberish and rocking back and forth. Tells me she is lost. I suspected she had heat stroke and was suffering from delirium and exhaustion. Poor woman, thank god I saved her.

I pop upstairs to get a damp towel and the fan. When I return I find the woman sitting on my sofa, smoking a cigarette, masturbating. Great.

""You can't do that"" I yell in bemusement but she carries on, telling me how nice it feels. ""Can you lick my clitoris?"" she asks, to which I said no way and she needs to leave. ""Do you have a dog?"" I see my chance to get her out of the house. ""Yes I have a dog, come with me"" and I managed to get her up and out into the garden.

She collapses onto the floor. Making gagging noises, telling me she's going to die, still with her hand between her legs. It is 40 degrees and I myself am struggling to be fair, so I know she will be in trouble if I don't get her out of the heat. 

I call 999, they take 5 minutes to answer, and eventually they tell me there are no ambulances. ""Is she breathing... is she conscious... OK then, if she passes out, put her in the discovery position and fan her, then call us back and we will try to hurry up.""

She keeps asking for the dog and that she wants us both to make love to her. When I try to move her into the house she keeps grabbing me and trying to kiss me. What the hell am I going to do?  
The hospital is a 5 minute walk, so I make the decision to get her there by carrying her or she is going to die from heat stroke. So I tell her I know a really nice dog across the road and I'm going to take her to it. Her eyes light up and she heads with me out of the garden. 

I get her to put her leggings on and begin to walk to the hospital while being sexually assaulted the whole way. 999 rings me back and I tell them the plan. The closest door is the ear and throat department or something like that, so I carry her in there where there is air conditioning and sit her down. I shout for help and a nurse appears, she fetches some water and I leave her in their capable hands. They all seemed to know who she was and apparently she had been on the mental ward. As I walk out she yells ""Where is this dog to lick my clitoris??""  The nurses look puzzled, I shrug my shoulders and walk out. 

I return home, lock all the doors and gates, and have a shower to wash the woman's sweat and fanny juice off me. I've not seen her today, hope she is feeling better.

If the mods so wish I can verify the story with video evidence as my house has Nest cameras, but I won't post these publicly for obvious reasons. 

TLDR: I let a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She turned out to be a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to masturbate on my sofa and sexually assault me

Edit 1: Gonna leave in the typo of recovery/discovery, I believe they call that a Freudian slip

Edit 2: Getting lots of requests, so here is a photo from my back garden cctv: [https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q](https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q) The inside video with sound is much better but will remain unshared, sorry.

dymg67,TIFU by giving my wife a facial in front of my step-daughter,37970,0.69,2971,2019-11-19 21:39:38,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dymg67/tifu_by_giving_my_wife_a_facial_in_front_of_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dymg67/tifu_by_giving_my_wife_a_facial_in_front_of_my/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,True,False,False,"Still processing this one since it took place about five hours ago. Me (45M) and my wife (47F) have been married for about 5 years and have a combined family. Most of our kids are half time with us and half time with their other parents. Anyway, my 20yo step-daughter's room is just down the hall from the Master Bedroom. About 6 weeks ago, she started sleep walking and wakes standing in random places, she even woke up in the kennel with our dog once (yes I know it's super strange).

Because my wife and I are trying not to scar the kids, we wait until they are all asleep before we have sexy times. Many times this means we go to sleep and then wake each other up in the middle of the night for sexy time. Last night was one of those nights. When we went to bed (between 8 and 9 because we get up at 4am to workout) kids were still up and milling around, so we figured we'd wait until the middle of the night or have a quicky before we went to the gym.

A few hours later I wake to a stiffy pressed up against my wife's backside and decide it's game time. Within a couple of minutes we are deeply into it and a few minutes later we know it's about time for the grand finale. My wife breathlessly tells me the words that every man around the planet loves to hear ""I want to finish you with my mouth"". I practically jumped off the bed and stand there as my wife gets on her knees to give me a toe curling BJ.

I am going to interrupt this story for a moment to give another little factoid. My wife was a single mom to four girls for many years prior to meeting and then marrying me. Her and her daughters are pretty immodest around the house. I'm constantly asking them to put shorts or sweats on.

Anyway, there I am standing naked beside my bed. My wife is on her knees sucking my soul out through my dick. My eyes are closed my head is back and I'm just about to release when I get that weird feeling that I'm being watched. I open my eyes and see my 20yo step daughter standing three feet behind her mom in a tank top and panties. I reflexively pulled back from my wife's mouth which caused her to grab extra hard the next thing I know I'm spraying my load all over her face while I'm looking directly into my step-daughter's eyes. My wife is trying to be playful and thinks I'm just feeling kinky and I was just trying to cover myself. My step-daughter just stands there for what seemed like an eternity before saying ""holy shit"" over and over and walking out of our room and back to hers. Of course as soon as my wife heard her daughter's voice she became much less playful and everything got deadly serious.

So now I've gone to the gym, am sitting at my desk working and my wife has been in talking with her daughter for the past couple of hours. Honestly my only fuckup was the timing. But it did happen today, so there is that.

TL;DR My wife and I had middle of the night sexy time, sleep walking step-daughter walked into the room and watched me frost my wife like a cake.

Follow Up: They are done talking came out of the room laughing and stuff so I guess no harm no foul. My wife said the three of us should sit down later and talk about the what happened and that her daughter has some questions.

Edit: To all those wondering why I added the part about how my step-daughters dress. At the time I was worried that my wife was going to be thinking I was a freak for nutting as soon as I saw her daughter in her panties. That didn't happen at all, when I mentioned it to my wife she waved it off. If I were to write this post now I would leave it out, but it was important to my mindset at the time.

Edit: People are claiming that it's been deleted, but I still see it and haven't tried to delete it. Any how, I just tagged it as NSFW (something I should have done in the beginning, but I didn't know) maybe that fixes things. I'm enjoying some of you funny sick people.

Edit: Well we just had an hour plus conversation. My step-daughter was just wanting to clear the air (she was a lot more mature about it than I thought she would be). She asked a couple of questions about how often is normal and stuff like that. I don't want to get too specific, but all of her questions centered around how far my wife and I pushed each other's boundaries sexually. We were open and honest with her about it. Turns out she is not a virgin (I am actually surprised) and the first guy she was with was very pushy. The guy she's with now is very laid back, but maybe too laid back. We told her to be vocal with him about what she wants. I think she understands, but my wife is going to follow up on the conversation later.

BTW, she did not even realize what was going on at first. All she saw was that I was standing there naked. It was when I saw her and started to freak out that she understood what was going on.. My wife and I have already stripped the bed and are washing the sheets and comforter. I am shampooing the carpet this afternoon and there are spots on the wall that need to be washed. My wife found some of my material in her hair... at work she sent me [this pic](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xLxBjV-kW_8/UI2KgL4_O_I/AAAAAAAAG8U/yMWE-6BXi8I/s1600/Cameron-Diaz-There's-Something-About-Mary-Ejaculate-Hair-Gel.jpeg).

I got back on here and this post is at almost 10k and my inbox is screaming for mercy. I'll try to answer as many questions as possible.

OK, I'm disabling inbox replies. I can't believe that my (by far) most upvoted post is about my wife and I nearly emotionally scaring my step-daughter. Be well everybody."

I know it’s overpriced coffee and a poor financial move, but I felt like treating myself today. 

So I’m walking into work, an iced coffee in each hand, and a coworker greets me. He notices the two coffees and says “double fisting coffees today, eh? Man you love that place.” For some reason I was immediately embarrassed by the fact that I had bought two large iced coffees for myself. So, I lied about it and said “actually they accidentally made me 2 and gave me the second for free, so I guess it’s two coffees for me today.”

I thought that would be the end of it, but then he, thinking I had a happenstance second cup of coffee that I didn’t need, asked if he could have it. Being the nice guy that I am, and not wanting to be caught in a lie, I gave it to him, pretending like I probably wasn’t going to drink it anyway. 

So I essentially bought my coworker a large iced coffee today. There was absolutely no reason to be embarrassed or lie about this lol. Why am I like this??

TLDR: I bought two iced coffees for myself, was embarrassed about it so I told a coworker that one was a free one made by accident. He then asked for it, and I gave it to him because I didn’t wanna get caught in a lie."

My boyfriend told me he'd wait for me by the car. I leave the store the sun in shining and I don't have my sunglasses but I can see him standing close to our car with his back facing me.

I could feel my face turning red and I start apologizing profusely while trying to explain the situation in a panic. A little further away by our car I can see my boyfriend walking towards me almost tripping for laughing so much. After what felt like forever the man also bursts out laughing saying it's fine that I'm glad I liked his ass. 

I couldn't laugh even if I wanted to. I was horrified. I still am. My boyfriend thinks this is all too funny not to share but I'm going to stay anonymous doing so.

If the man whose ass I grabbed happens to see this I am so sorry. Just know that a part of me died today and this gave me another reason to never leave my house again. Social distansing no longer feels difficult in any way.

TLDR:  I went to surprise who I thought was my boyfriend with a firm ass grabbing followed by a moan only to find out he wasn't my boyfriend. I'm now dying from embarrassment

Edit: Wow thank you everyone for sharing your funny stories keep them coming, me and my boyfriend are having a blast reading all of them! I'm glad that I'm not the only ass grabber around It's really helping me with the embarrassment.

Edit: wow this blew up thank you for all the nice comments and the awards. I'm able to laugh at it now thanks to all of your stories so thank you. I truly felt horrible and embarrassed for what happened and yes the situation could have been worse if the genders were reversed or if the recipient of this mistake didn't take it so lightly. Thank you for everyone who can see when people make an actual mistake and can distinguish that from an actually vile act. I shared this because the man didn't take it seriously and laughed with my boyfriend about the accident and no harm was done apart from the shame I felt. And yes rBangerz YT you can use this story for your video, thanks for asking me beforehand I appreciate that."

So, I was making Instant ramen, as college students tend to do. And then I thought to myself ""business has been good lately, I can afford to treat myself"", so I figured I would indulge by adding the most precious of treats to my broth: a hard boiled egg.

So I looked up on the Internet if you could hard boil an egg in the microwave. And, as luck would half it, I found a very easy to follow article with instructions on how to do it. I was filled with glee.

So, popping the egg in some water and in the microwave, I put the timer to 8 minutes, following the instructions to a T. 3 minutes of me salivating for the fruit of my labor, a loud bang ravaged me from my thoughts.

Indeed, the egg had exploded, filling my whole microwave with bloody egg gore. Dumbstruck I checked the article for the source of my mistakes, and that’s when I noticed the article is from April first, 2014.

Well played, internet food journal. I’m gonna clean the microwave now.

TL;DR check the date of articles if you don’t want your kitchen to get nuked

Edit: wow this blew up! Disclaimer for everyone blasting my ass about this, I was high as shit when that happened.

Edit: Also my girlfriend was involved in the cooking of the egg, just so you folks know!"
asppfi,TIFU by telling my three year old daughter that I would eat her booty,37858,0.86,1859,2019-02-20 21:06:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/asppfi/tifu_by_telling_my_three_year_old_daughter_that_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/asppfi/tifu_by_telling_my_three_year_old_daughter_that_i/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Alright so let’s start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you’ll be like wtf? 

So my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it’s more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife “Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom” and off to the races they go. 

Obviously this is a game that both parents play and she’ll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it’s cute and we haven’t gotten any feedback on it.

This brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells “GET MY BOOTY DADDY!” To which I reply nonchalantly “I’m going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom” since her butt was right next to my face. 

I immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling “EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY” and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it’s too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

I took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I’m dreading picking her up.

TL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I’m going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. 

Edit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

There were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

Thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

For those that got offended, sorry? None of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. Cheers!"

We decided to go to a local bakery before heading home. The bakery sells great hot chocolate and other treats. We got in and ordered two hot chocolates.

My girlfriend is lactose intolerant so having milk makes her feel sick but she is able to enjoy it with no problems if she has lactase enzyme capsules before eating anything with milk in it.

The bakery was empty apart from us and an older lady sitting a few tables from us. As we were waiting for our order my girlfriend had to use the restroom so she left for a while. Our drinks arrived in the meanwhile.

My girlfriend uses lactase enzyme capsules that can be opened and sprinkled on top of the food/drink before eating it or consumed as is. My girlfriend finds that opening them and adding them straight to food works best for her.

I was carrying her stuff in my pockets so I decided to mix the lactase enzyme in her drink before she came back so it could take its time to dissolve properly. I opened the pill, poured the stuff inside her hot chocolate and mixed it in and didn't think much of it.

The lady left and I was sitting there alone now. My girlfriend was taking a while and I started wondering if everything was fine. A while later my girlfriend, looking like she was holding in laughter, came back to the table with the old lady. The lady looked at me with a stern panicked look on her face and asked me what I put in my girlfriends drink. I was confused and it took me a while to process the question. 

Then I realized how suspicious I must have looked. A guy out with a girl, taking a pill from his pocket and mixing the content of it in her drink while she is using the bathroom. And that's exactly what the lady sitting a few tables from us saw.

I'm an anxious man so I panicked and frantically started explaining everything to the lady showing the package for the pills and everything. My girlfriend confirmed what I was saying but the lady was still having a hard time believing it. She had called the cops so we had to wait for them to show up and explain the situation to them. I felt extremely awkward and embarrassed. The old lady was in a bit of a shock but eventually she believed everything was okay and left.

In the end we were able to laugh about the situation. I'm really glad that the lady actually took action and I did thank her for trying to help in a situation like that. It's good to know that people look after each other.

Tldr; I ordered hot chocolates with my girlfriend at a bakery. She went to the bathroom and I put a lactase enzyme pill in her drink making an old lady think I was roofying her. She called the cops

Edit: Some people are confused about why the lady didn't stop when I explained what the pills where. She hadn't heard about those things before and she was scared and confused since she thought a crime was happening right infront of her. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, so it took some time to convince her it was all fine. It wasn't entitlement or anger it was confusion. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay and that I wasn't lying, the old lady was very kind. And she called the police before talking with my girlfriend"

As in at least a month and a half. 


I went to stock up on groceries, and as I left my house, and got on a bus
(you don’t need a mask on them where I live)

I realised I forgot my mask. 


I got off and walked home because I’m not about getting the rona. 

As I arrived at my house, I reached for my keys. Nope. There was nothing in my pockets. 

I retraced my steps, thinking I must have dropped them on the sidewalk. Nope. I then realised that they must be on the bus. I think they must have fallen out of my pocket when I left the bus in such a hurry.

That’s when it struck me, I probably should call a locksmith. ( I have a spare set in my house) so I go home to connect to my WiFi. I reached into my pocket, and then I realised I left it on charge...

So my big brain does some really smart thinking, and I decide to break in, to my own house...

I tried climbing on to my balcony, because I thought I left the window unlocked.

So there I am, looking like a ninja climbing on to my balcony. I thought I finessed it and I could get in easy, but that’s where my little hope broke through. 

I heard a siren, looked down and saw a police car. I then realised how bad I looked. 

I explained what happened, and they looked really confused. I showed them some ID and showed them it was my house. 

That is the story of how I nearly got arrested.

TL;DR I forgot my mask, which led to me losing my keys, which led to me nearly being arrested for breaking and entering, into my own house."

About 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the TVs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

I can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

After a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

As it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. They're also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I'd grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

And **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.


**

TL;DR: I made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. Everyone lost their minds."

I understand that politics has had some really bad repercussions over the last couppe of years for some families, but I am just now beginning to witness it first hand. My mom made a post on FB about condemning the invasion on the U.S. Capitol. Someone commented on it basically saying that Antifa is planting people in there to make the right look crazy. My fiancèe showed it to me and said she can comment actual substance to disprove these comments and I encouraged her to do so because I honestly think the truth should be shared, especially if someone is passionate about the subject. So she linked her research and my mom thanked her for the backup and the other person didn't have a reply to it and that was the end of that...until it wasn't. My soon to be MIL basically commented that everyone should keep an open mind and that there's a lot of fake news being spewed by the media. She argues that Trump has done a lot of great things that the media doesn't acknowledge and that people shouldn't make rude comments about her president. My mom didn't realize who made this comment, and immediately replied that MIL is one of the idiots who blindly follows Trump and that if she agrees with him, then she's a traitor. She immediately apologized after realizing who it was and tried messaging her and texting her, but shes been unfriended, blocked, and now my fiancèe is having a pretty heated political discussion with her mom. We've tried apologizing on behalf of my mom, but MIL is airing out aalllll of her political beliefs. Man I can't wait until the wedding! /s

1. I’m a shower gal. The last time I took a bath was when I was sick, YEARS ago.
2. I am a teacher under copious amounts of stress from this lovely school year

The FU:

Today after a particularly stressful day teaching, I decided I needed to do some self care. I went to ulta and was browsing and I stumbled upon the bath bomb section. In my head I thought “why not?? Baths can’t be that bad, I always see people in movies relaxing in a bath. Let’s give it a try!” I carefully selected a pink bath bomb, and that dear reader is key to my fu.

When I got home I decided to make a night out of it. I got my book, poured myself a glass of wine, put  on a bubbling face mask, and I turned on some tunes. I was sitting in the tub and I dropped in the bath bomb. It was pretty! And smelled great! In order to soak in the ~relaxation vibes~ I leaned back and gracefully, with my gangly ass elbows flailing about for balance, knocked the wine glass into the tub and the glass shattered instantly.

So there I was, in a tub with pink water, broken glass floating EVERYWHERE, and bubbles all over my face from the face mask. I tried to wipe my eyes to see but instead rubbed the bubbles in my eyes. I called for my boyfriend who runs in and sees me crying from the soap, surrounded by glass and “bloody” pink water. He then sees the 3 inch long shard of glass JUTTING out of my back. After a mini freak out on his part, he fished out all the glass, yanked that sucker out of my back, and had to flush out my eyes because by that point they were burning and I was hysterical. 0/10 would NOT recommend taking a bath to de-stress.


TL:DR baths are overrated unless you are a graceful swan who can control their appendages.

Edit: a lot of people keep saying that glass doesn’t float so this is fake, I used the wrong word guys! I didn’t mean like floating on the top, but rather mixing in with the water/flowing around any time I moved? My movement stirred it around. Sorry for the confusion!"

I had 11 years of orthodontic work starting with a gum graft when I was 5.

We'll come back to this later.

When I was growing up and even in early adulthood I could hardly breathe. I would sleep in a sitting position when I got sick, and when I wasn't sick my nose was always clogged and my tonsils were the size of golf balls.

I never really complained that I couldn't breathe with my mouth closed because I assumed that it was normal somehow.

Eventually when I was 24 I went to an ENT specialist to get it checked out because one more night of sitting upright unable to sleep because I couldn't breathe was too much.

I went to this German doctor who checked me out and he was very confused how I had lived so long with such a horrible airway. At this point I was about 270lbs and just shy of 5'11. Physical exercise wasn't my forte.

He asked me if I had ever broken my nose and to my knowledge I never have. He was confused by this so he sent me for some x-rays. Before I left he told me that I likely need a structural rhinoplasty, and I probably also needed my tonsils out.

The x-ray comes back and he tells me that it makes no sense. I'm not a doctor but when the specialist says your bones are wrong, you get a bit concerned so I went back in.

He showed me on the x-ray that my jaw was not a straight line, there are sections in it that go up in levels as if I had a ton of work done on my teeth and that the work likely messed up my nose so bad that it wasn't functional.

He asked me what orthodontic work I had and all clicked for him when I gave him the laundry list of work that they had done. I told him I had gum grafts, headgear, braces, tongue cages, spacers, retainers, and they wanted to break my jaw and move it forward but after 11 years of this I decided enough was enough. I wont have my jaw broken in the name of good teeth.

The doctor told me to roll back to the spacers. I explained it was a device they installed in my mouth that opened my pallet from a V shape to a U shape and he said that's what did it.

When the orthodontist increased the size of my upper jaw it pulled my nose over to the right side of my face permanently blocking that nostril and partially blocking the other.

I had this done when I was 7 years old and coincidentally that's also the time that I turned into a walrus of a young boy.

So long story short they gave me a structural nose job, removed my tonsils and adenoids and I lost 80 pounds in 6 months and had a lot more energy. I could sleep laying down even when I was sick and even can kind of breathe with my mouth closed.

So to the German guy who fixed my face, thank you. I would not have lived as good of life if it wasn't for your work.

And to the orthodontist... thank you for fixing my teeth even though it cost me 14 years of health.

TL;DR Orthodontists fucked up my nose, I didn't understand the problem completely for 14 years.

Edit: Wow the amount of people responding that they have similar issues is massive. If you do a class action holla at your boy."

I like to chat, makes the day go faster. I see that the elderly woman has several big bags of green marshmallows and I comment on the nice mint smell coming from them, which I could smell through the mask. She was worried, because she hadn't thought they were mint. They were for her grandchildren. I just told her that I would check the ingredients. Nope, no mint. Turned out to be the chocolate mint candy UNDER the bags. I did comment on the fact that it had tilapia in it, though. She had no clue what that was, and was absolutely horrified to hear that her marshmallows contained fish. I just offhandedly told her that it was probably just a new alternative to the pig's feet they normally use. If anything, she turned greener. She had no idea where gelatin comes from. She still did buy the marshmallows, but was in shock and horror at the idea of what she was feeding the kids.

TLDR: I horrified an old woman by telling her that marshmallows are made of pigs feet and fish. Ruined them for her for life.

This just happened this past weekend

I hate the word horny but I am that x 1000000 right now and was sexting with a friend and it was getting pretty graphic.  I sent her a bunch of vids and she was so impressed by my seductive stripper skills that she asked if I could surprise her friends by posing as the Uber Eats guy and stripping for them.  Fuck yeah!  I’ve always fantasized about this, i’m an exhibitionist, what a dream.  We decide I’ll deliver the food, and she’ll make a joke like how much to take it all off...

We set up the plan, the time, etc and I go and pick up the food and come to deliver it.  I’m wearing a man thong under my jeans, i’m freshly groomed, I’m rock fucking hard and I’m nervous but excited.  I give myself a little fluff in the hallway and knock on the door.... which is answered by MY EX.  Like, not a kind of dated ex, but like lived with.  She is apparently friends of my friends friend (that makes sense, I read it back).  I’ve always held a good job, and she looks at me with so much sympathy. Like shocked my life has come to this.  She asks why I’m doing Uber Eats and I just say l need the extra money and she is like “that’s so sad do you want to come in”

I hesitate, but come in and see my sexting friend. She’s drunk and says “heyyyyy uber eats,  how much to show me that cock!”  Her friends laugh, but my ex is like, “chill, this is my ex.  i feel so bad he’s delivering food!” or something along those lines.  Me and sexting girl share a weird look, she is confused as fuck.  I say I have to go, and race out of there.  Holy fuck.

tl:dr went to strip for my friend, didn’t realize my ex would be there, and she thought i was at a very low point


edit:  wow didn’t expect this to blow up!
- no the photos in my post history are not what i sent to sexting girl.  what i sent to her was much more..... graphic?  lol
- yes i have had sex with sexting girl.  we met on tinder and our relationship has been 10000% sexual
- no i have never stripped before
- no sexting girl didn’t say anything to my ex.  we talked after and she’s just bummed that i didn’t whip my cock out in front of them all.  she said she would have made my ex realize what she lost lol.

edit 2: more answers to more questions!
- as i said the photos/videos i sent to texting girl were more graphic.  i’ll just say that she’s really into butt stuff.  and she really likes it when I wear her panties.  I’ll leave it at that

- nothing wrong with uber eats, and surprised it’s so well paying!  i have just had a “career” type job since college, so seeing this change of path seemed like I had fallen on hard times to my ex i’m guessing, understandably 

- no i don’t have an onlyfans lol.  but feel free to dm me i’m happy to share"

Now , I am known for eating right before bed and recently my doctor had recommended that I add more fibre to my diet along with some sleeping pills . This was my first fuck up. Unknowingly to me fibre causes MAD GAS. the kind noise that is only found by a heard of elephants running though a concrete desert. 

Months have gone by and I started to sleep better than I ever had before due to the pills and diet change , forgetting all about the app. But one concerning thing was that my boyfriend was starting to feel distant. I would wake up in the morning and he would have made his way down to the couch until I got up and came down . No arguments nothing of the obvious I could wrap my pea brain around at the time but as anyone would I started to get suspicious there was someone else. 

About an hour ago , I remembered the app records noise and decided if I checked the app I should be able to tell what time he is getting up and leaving the bedroom and maybe see if his phone rings or anything of that sort to try to piece together why my lovely caveman was leaving me to go sleep downstairs. 

WELL LET ME TELL YOU. 
I Found out why.
And I am about to reveal my sad embarrassing truth to you. 

I have been indiscriminately but vigorously farting the most thunderous claps from the depths of hell you can imagine. I mean there was 124 recordings from last night alone , as soon as I fall asleep I start letting them RIP unknowingly because of the strength of the sleepers. 124 times my sphincter deceived me . And to make it worse , I sleep on my side shimmied into him with my butt and back. So I’ve been hitting him with the devils breath directly ON HIM. and after about 10 of these clappers you hear Rustling and footsteps and low mumbling of cursing the whole way until the door slams. 

So my friends , do not take too much fibre and sleeping pills if you don’t want your significant other to mildly dislike you and be distant 

TL;DR changed my diet to more fibre , took sleeping pills to knock me out , recorded myself blowing gas as strong as a whale coming up to breathe.

Edit: since you guys are wondering I did bring it up to him when he first started to go to the couch and he just shrugged it off saying he’s having a hard time sleeping in the bed  and I was not buying it lol

EDIT: Okay so he is out for the evening , but I will text him now to confront him because you guys are making feel funny about it instead of embarrassed and I will come back with an update

Edit ok it took me forever to figure out how to post photos to Reddit but I think I got it :

[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/jZmwtLD?r) 

[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/74Z4yLI)

Edit : I sent him this post and we are now having a great laugh about it. Thank you for all the stories I enjoyed every single one lol

Edit Ok I’m sorry for all the edits but the app is - sleep booster : auto tracker
Edit: I recommend getting a different one for this one costs a fair bit to use the basic features while some are free for the same feats

Edit : okay guys I will post the recordings when I go on break I’m heading to work now

Edit : still going to post the recordings on break but just wanted to address this because it’s in every few comments -  I am a paramedic so my shifts are very long leaning from 12-16 hours and usually disable me from eating the last 4 hours ish of my shift for that is the busiest time .. Once I’m off I eat and go straight to bed so I will be trying to prevent myself from doing that or packing extra lunch to snack on at work. Thank you all lol. 

Edit : okay last edit .. A lot of you have asked for the recording and a lot of you are asking for me not to post it. To safe my face and peoples ears, and If it’s allowed I will just get you to inbox me if you want to hear it and I will send it when I can lol ( hopefully this is allowed and works )

Edit: can anyone explain to me how to send a file through inbox lol

Okay y’all win I can’t send them via inbox so here we go. I had to cut it really short because he says my name multiple times but this is my I believe worst fart of the night L O L enjoy. And If you don’t want to hear it I don’t recommend opening lol

So I went to the flea market and found some cool stuff like a Didgeridoo and an old Gameboy advance. But something else struck me. A microscope for only 5 bucks.

It was in great condition and still had all the little extras since it was made for kids. As soon as I got home, i needed to examine everything. So I grabbed a thin slice of cucumber, and than a leaf. I was astonished how well it worked given that it was for kids. I then used a drop of blood, and you could see the red blood cells in all their glory.

So I thought what every guy probably would have done. I know it's no nut November, but i was eager to look at my future children while they were still inside my balls. So I pulled up a nice video from my girlfriend and started to masturbate. I managed it to catch all of my cum in a petri dish, and used a pipette to add a bit to the microscope slide. I was so excited. 

As I slowly upped the magnification, i needed to adjust the focus. And there I saw my sperm. But it wasn't moving. Not one bit. I was shocked and didn't knew what to do. So I made an appointment at my urologist to make an infertility test. And now k know it officially that I'm indeed infertile. Sorry mom and dad, as an only child, it seems like out family genes end here.


TL;DR used a microscope to look at my semen, only to realize I'm infertile"

On Friday, i went to view an apartment. I had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
So i see the apartment, everything’s great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

I get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. I’m going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

Okay so now it’s Saturday night and i’m just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let’s call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

So monday rolls around and I go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

I walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

The woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve’s WIFE. steve looks totally chill, while i’m freaking outside but trying to remain calm. I did not sign up for this. 

Anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married. 
Can’t wait to live there for a whole year! 

 
TL;DR 
Slept with my landlord without knowing who he was and found out he has a wife.

EDIT: YALL IM A GUY. sorry, i didn’t clarify that in the original. 

EDIT 2: wow this blew up what the hell. i’m not going to tell his wife because 1) id like for her to not kick me out of the apt and 2:) as many people have pointed out they could be in an open relationship and i don’t want to accuse him of cheating and make things messy or weird.

EDIT 3: yes i used protection, i’m always safe."

My wife's face is still a mess and I'm sitting here with an ice-pack on my dick. Alternate account because I don't want my family reading this.

&#x200B;

So my wife and I were trying to get in the mood tonight. It's been a rough couple of weeks as I am sure it has been for everyone. I'm a physician dealing with coronavirus at work while experiencing a massive paycut, meanwhile my wife's been working from home while managing the kids who have been home from school. Needless to say we've had a lot of anxiety and stress on our plate but we're committed to making time for each other. 

So we are getting in bed and she wants me to tie her up and tickle her. I get her in position and give her a little slap to get things started, and I mean a little slap. Suddenly, she starts crying. Initially, I thought it was a joke but she just kept going. Within a few seconds she's sobbing, tears are everywhere. I undo her knots and try to comfort her with little success. The floodgates open and she starts pouring out about her worries with the mortgage, my health, and on and on. After what felt like an eternity, she begins to calm down. 

Obviously, I'm no longer in the mood and I didn't think she was either, so I suggest we just go to bed. She feels guilty and insists we can still have sex. I tell her it's ok let's just go to bed. We go back and forth about this for a bit. Then I start to roll away but I guess in her guilt she grabs my pants and frantically starts to pull them down. Before I can stop her she accidentally grabs my penis and yanks it like a lawnmower starter. I drop to the floor in agony and she suddenly realizes what she just did... so seconds later we're now both rolling on the bed crying. I ended up with a rug-burn in a very sensitive spot and after another eternity of crying, my wife's face is beet-red and puffy. 

tldr: I slapped my wife during foreplay and she cried, in her guilt for killing the mood, she tried to take my pants off and yanked on my dick giving me a rug-burn."
13smbtl,"TIFU by donating $15,041 to a poor community in Bangladesh instead of the $150 donation I intended.",37415,0.94,426,2023-05-27 01:04:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/13smbtl/tifu_by_donating_15041_to_a_poor_community_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/13smbtl/tifu_by_donating_15041_to_a_poor_community_in/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"This happened in February of last year, but my friends have been telling me I need to post this story online … so here goes nothing:

My wife and I (both 31 years old, at the time) moved into a new three-unit apartment building in San Francisco.  One of our neighbors is a 70-something year old retired veteran, we’ll call him Joe.  For context, Joe is a white American guy and he’s also a devout Hindu priest.  One day I run into Joe in my hallway, and he tells me about this charity he manages for a community in Bangladesh.  I wanted to support my neighbor and the charity, so I ask Joe to send me the GoFundMe link.

The next day at work, I go on the GoFundMe page and donate $150.  Or so I thought.  Moments later, I get a text on my phone warning me of an unusually large transaction on my credit card.  I’m confused and swipe to open the text message. It says I have made a payment of $15,041 to GoFundMe.  Immediately I’m sweating.  How could I have donated FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS?  I spend the next 10-15 minutes retracing my steps, and finally I realize my credit card starts with the numbers 4 and 1.  It seems I had accidentally started typing my credit card information while my cursor was still in the donation box, and just like that 150 became 15041.  Yikes.

I call GoFundMe’s support line in a panic, and when I finally connect with a human I explain what happened.  “No need to worry”, he tells me, they will initiate a refund of the transaction which should process in 3-7 business days.  That’s a huge relief.  But then I ask the agent if the charity will be able to see the donation on the GoFundMe page until it is refunded.  “What do you mean?” the agent asks me.  “What do YOU mean what do I mean?” was my response.  “Will they be able to see the $15,041 donation?!”  Unfortunately, yes, the agent tells me.  They will be able to see it until the refund process is complete.  I tell him that’s a big problem, as the entire GoFundMe had hardly raised that much at that point.  Surely they will notice their fundraiser doubling overnight?

My plan was to knock on Joe’s door the following morning to give him the full story, so that he could pass it along to his contacts in Bangladesh.  But when I woke up the next morning, I looked at my phone and saw I had 40+ notifications on Facebook.  Someone had sent me a friend request, had liked many of my old posts, and had sent me many messages. Immediately I was concerned when I saw that the individual messaging me had a Hindu name, but I never could have imagined what I saw when I opened his first message…

The man had sent me a video of himself from Bangladesh, surrounded by dozens of impoverished and hungry people holding bags of food, thanking me BY NAME (Michael) for my generous donation.  A big round of applause for Michael.  At this point, I’ve leapt out of my bed and I’m pacing.  Part of me wants to scream, part of me wants to crack up laughing.  I start swiping through the man’s messages, and it is picture after picture after picture of poor Bangladeshis thanking me for my kind donation.  Literally hundreds of photos of frail, elderly, disabled, and malnourished individuals holding signs with my name.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  I've uploaded a portion of the video, and a few photos, for you guys to see here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/tROXniV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tROXniV)

Needless to say, I couldn’t live with myself just donating $150 after seeing how the community responded to the $15,041.  I decided the least I could do was to add a zero, and so I donated $1,500 once the original donation was refunded.  The charity’s host was incredibly gracious and understanding, and he explained to me that $1,500 goes very far in Bangladesh for urgent food relief.  Here is the charity’s new GoFundMe link if you want to check it out: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-food-relief-assistance-in-bangladesh](https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-food-relief-assistance-in-bangladesh)

Ultimately I think the whole experience was a win-win.  I helped a great cause, and I got a funny story out of it.

TL;DR: Some impoverished folks in Bangladesh thought I had sent them $15,041 but it was an accident and I had to request a refund for most of it.

EDIT:  Many are asking why there is no $1,500 donation listed in the fund’s donation history.  I donated to an old campaign link for the same charity.  It is readily findable online, if you feel compelled to search for it."

Sorry I’m on mobile, but this is the original post


So this fuck up is only like 10 hours old.

This morning, I was at the airport to head back to school. I look ahead in the security like an I see Joel McKinnon Miller AKA Detective Scully from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. My sister takes a picture of us and I’m on my way. While waiting for Coffee I decide to post the picture on the subreddit. I get on my flight and it’s at 100 or so upvotes. I land and I’m at 4K updates and have a whole slew of comments congratulating me for coming out. I go and look back at the title of the post and find out I said “came out to him” instead of “came up to him.” I’m at 25.4k upvotes now and am still getting comments on people congratulating me for coming out...


Also most of my swim team knows about the post and now I’m never living down the whole “accidentally came out on the internet” thing...

TL;DR- Met a celebrity, ended up accidentally coming out to the entire internet

Edit: to make explicitly clear, no I am not gay."
ho9wtc,"TIFU by applying to a job in my city, but it was 6000 kilometers away from where I expected.",37365,0.93,1353,2020-07-10 01:18:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ho9wtc/tifu_by_applying_to_a_job_in_my_city_but_it_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ho9wtc/tifu_by_applying_to_a_job_in_my_city_but_it_was/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"I've been laughing at myself for the whole of today so I thought I would share this with you, it's probably not as funny as I think it is, but alas. 

For context, I've just finished school and I'm looking for temporary jobs over the summer so I can get a bit of money for when university starts. I have been looking at a number of job sites and I have applied for three jobs. I have the setting to search for temporary jobs near me when I saw another advert. 

This was for a job at a well-known shoe company that has two separate stores in my city. On the job advert, it didn't say which one the vacancy was for, it just said in Edinburgh. This is where I'm from. So I started the application process and put in my details and CV. Now it was all going well until there was a slightly confusing question asking if I had the right to work in the USA. 

Now, this definitely confused me but I ticked no and opened the job advert again. I searched it from my computer and it still said the job was in Edinburgh and that it was within 5 miles of me.  I thought huh, strange but I'll tick no and if they don't want me I won't hear from them, no big deal. 

Anyway later on I received an email saying they had checked my CV and they wanted to conduct a virtual interview. I was very surprised because it was less than a day after I had applied but I was happy that I thought I might have a job there. So I selected the time for 1 pm the next day (today) thinking nothing more of it. I'm good at interviews so I didn't feel the need to prep. 

Anyway, I got a very polite email shortly before the interview from a very confused manager of the store who had looked at my details. 

He asked me why I was applying for a job in Edinburgh Indiana when I was based in Scotland. When I read the email my jaw absolutely dropped because the job wasn't ""In Edinburgh"" it was IN Edinburgh, Edinburgh Indiana USA. 

I'm not from the USA so it never dawned on me that it could be a state code and not just in Edinburgh Scotland. I sent him a very apologetic email but I'm just glad he noticed before what I imagine would be an incredibly awkward job interview, although that definitely would have been a good laugh. 

If this does well I'm sure I can link the job interview and his email in case anyone wants to make sure this actually happened but I can't be bothered right now. 

TLDR: Accidentally applied for a job in a town with the exact same name as mine 6000 km away and didn't notice until a store manager sent me a polite email asking why I was applying there.

On Wednesday’s our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it’s a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we’ll call her Sarah (changed). She’s quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here’s where the first fuck up happens.
   While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah’s right knocker my words start to trail off. “Damn I hope everyone is oka.....” that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said “that’s funny I haven’t had that much action in a while” which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying “ahh well we all have our dry spells.” Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what’s up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn’t care about that and that it was fine it’s just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.

TLDR: I yanked a widows titty

edit:*formatting* p.s. - damn I didn't check this for hours until I got home, thanks for all the kind words and your internet points, I never thought I'd be given gold for stopping short thanks!"
k8efbh,TIFU by lovingly laying out some clothes for my GF to wear the next morning,37338,0.91,1588,2020-12-07 16:16:47,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k8efbh/tifu_by_lovingly_laying_out_some_clothes_for_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k8efbh/tifu_by_lovingly_laying_out_some_clothes_for_my/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Happened 2 weeks ago. GF said she’d come stay at mine, but had work early the next day and didn’t have clean clothes. Obviously I was super happy and not wanting her to head home before coming over (losing valuable time with the woman I love) I reassured her that she had clothes here that she’d left previously. 

So I went to my drawers and found her a set of clothes, and laid them out on the chair in my room. She arrived, we had a lovely evening - dinner, sex, movie, cuddles, sleeeeeeep. 

The next morning she’s up at 06:30 and I go downstairs to make her a coffee. Bring it back upstairs and she’s standing in my room holding the sexy black panties that were part of the ensemble I laid out for her. 

“These aren’t my pants”

“...wh.... what?”

“These aren’t my pants...”

I don’t really need to go on. Needless to say I died inside and visibly outside too. she left for work shaken and upset. They really weren’t her pants. 

I’ve never cheated on her, so I know they are either from a previous partner (we’ve been together 1 year) or there’s been a launderette mishap or something. But I totally understand how she felt. 2 weeks have passed and we’ve worked through it. We have a few theories, but will never truly know where they came from. 

TLDR. Gave my GF some sexy black pants to wear, thinking they were hers. They were not.

EDIT - I’m English. When we say pants, we mean underpants. Not trousers. I’m sorry this has proved a difficult concept for so many people. I hope adding clarity to this edit will bring peace to those with troubled minds. Good night"

This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

Late last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

Though I’ve always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

I’m pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn’t. In the meantime a cardiologist said “Tough shit” and bumped up the meds.

During the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.

Flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must’ve been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled “metoprolol doping”, there it was. I still haven’t told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?

TL:DR Started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug."

I always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. So apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

I realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. Since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. It wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. Its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


TL;DR Dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


Update: So im not getting fired luckily. Im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. Ive heard so many Michael Jackson just beat it references its unreal. The group chat is mostly comprised of people I go to college with. Even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. My boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  Also holy fuck this blew up! Thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

Edit 2: People think im lying so group chat image for proof added https://imgur.com/cUKvx5w.jpg


Edit 3: just got off work, and apparently people still dont believe thus happened  so heres me and my SO conversation after it happened.  With the time on  the SS cause I sent it to the group chat so they knew what was going on

Today I arrived to the doctor a bit early so was killing time on my phone, where I came across this article:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/2019/07/art-student-dick-pic-painting-tinder.html
I read it, looked at a few other things, and then it was time for my treatment.

The dose of ketamine I receive is therapeutic, not recreational, but I definitely experience some of the side effects of the drug. Usually I see a lot of colors, fly through space tunnels, that kind of thing. It’s very relaxing. Not today. Today I saw dicks. Dicks everywhere. I flew through a tunnel of dicks. I twirled through a field of dicks. I looked through a kaleidoscope of dicks. It’s like every dick I’ve ever seen made an appearance. 

TL; DR: Looked at a painting of 140 dicks before ketamine infusions; ended up looking at 140,000 psychedelic dicks for an hour.

EDIT: (1) I’m a middle-aged, married lady. I’m only interested in my husband’s dick, which I’m sure was in there somewhere. (2) I receive treatments for Bipolar 2 disorder, which is characterized by longer depressive periods and shorter hypomanic periods. Ketamine is the only thing that’s allowed me to avoid the crippling effects of mood episodes. I’ve been able to reduce my other medications which had side effects I didn’t like, and I’ve been able to go off of anti-anxiety medications completely. (3) I don’t do recreational drugs and have never tried anything like that—not even weed. I also only have maybe ten drinks per year. (4) My doctor is the one who said I don’t get a recreational dose. He was really clear about that. Maybe he was downplaying things so I wouldn’t seek out illegal ketamine. I’m very creative, and my doctor has told me I’m “highly suggestible” and that I have the most vivid ketamine dreams of any of his patients. Not sure if that makes a difference. I would most definitely not try anything recreationally. (5) I’m not a doctor and not in the medical field. I don’t know if ketamine treatments will help you. They help me, but YMMV. I felt relief within 72 hours of my first infusion."

He included a drawing of how he did that.

So my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

I commented about it and said ""Hey that's how the TIFU guy sucked his own dick."" 

My boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and I gave him a little push.
Obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and I said;

""Well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

And in that moment I felt as if time slowed down and I can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

And that is how I fucked up by hurting his feelings.


TL;DR: I told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

Edit: Y'ALL NEED TO CHILL. I never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
To give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. Sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look I saw) but obviously I reassured him and we laughed about it. 

Reason I posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and I am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

We are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;) 

And thank you to those random redditers that find this post worthy of even a silver lol."

I heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. Upon my forehead I had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. The curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm.

On mobile so sorry for formatting and such. 

This happened last week and I still wince when I think about it..

I run a smoothie truck in a smallish southern city in the US. I was fairly busy making several drinks with my back to my service window. Next to my machine I have several drink carriers with handles. The lady sees them and asks if she can have the carrier with handles for her drinks, I tell her I’m sorry but those carriers are only for the Whites. 

As soon as the words left my mouth I could have died. I dropped the smoothie I was working on and did an about face so fast the truck rocked. 

I looked at the lady, the black lady, and just started apologizing, trying to explain. 

The Whites are a family of 7. The father comes by twice a week gets drinks for the family and at some point he bought and gave me X amount of carriers for him to use to make his trips easier. Turns out she knows the Whites, she goes to church with them. Thank you, Jesus. 

She couldn’t have been nicer over the ordeal and I still feel horrible about the whole thing. 

I have since put the carriers out of view.

TL;DR I told a black lady the drink carriers are only for the White family, but made it sound like they were only for the white families."

So, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

I figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.

We cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn't feel a damn thing.

We started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn't feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

Turns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

We were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might've been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

We threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

TLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.

Edit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?

Edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

Edit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn't do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You're **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.

Edit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn't much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We're enjoying them! 
1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. There's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. There's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind. "
fcsete,TIFU by trying to please my wife so hard I thought I’d die.,37122,0.78,1447,2020-03-03 15:28:35,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fcsete/tifu_by_trying_to_please_my_wife_so_hard_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fcsete/tifu_by_trying_to_please_my_wife_so_hard_i/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"This happened last month.

I have a wonderful wife, and even though we are in our late thirties and have three kids, we still like to copulate on a recreational level. 

Now, my wife can be hard to please. She’s a slow starter, and has a hard time reaching an orgasm from intercourse, which means that once I’m finished I’m dedicated to helping her reach the finish line too. This can take an additional 90 minutes from any previous coital activities. Frankly, it’s the hardest workout of my life, and often leaves me with a tennis elbow and inability to pronounce words for 30 minutes after. On the plus side I often don’t have time to do the dishes after.

Now, I’d say I’m more of an attentive lover than a good one. I tend to think of the female orgasm as a beat ‘em up on Playstation — if I just push all the buttons something special has to happen sooner or later. Over the years I’ve come to identify which buttons my wife likes to have pressed, and I’ve realized part of her being a slow starter stems from her being able to orgasm multiple times until she reaches a huge finale with a standing ovation, fireworks etc.

This means that any amorous activities need to fit into our packed time schedule. It had been a while since we were able to put the little monsters asleep at a reasonable time, which had probably led to a loss of form on my behalf.

Last month we were able to git ‘er done, as our local priest likes to put it.

This time, like an amateur, I tried to match her and make her reach climax first. So I’m mixing intense lovemaking with pulling out and going to town on her to help her reach her destination.

Through no fault of my own, my wife seems to enjoy it. She is having multiple of the minor orgasms, and I’m clinging on for dear life, hoping that she will reach the big one already, and also trying very hard to remember not to say that out loud. I’m a sweaty mess, the room is really warm, and I’d like to take a break for a sip of water and turning a fan on. Or to send in a replacement. Also, we will probably have to buy a new sofa.

We keep going at it, my pelvis is thrusting like a jackhammer on the fritz, and my tummy is making weird sounds.

Suddenly, my entire stomach decides that if I’m dumb enough to keep going despite its many warnings, it will take matters into its own hands. 

The worst pain I’ve ever suffered suddenly hits me mid-thrust, as my intestines try to break free of their confinement. I fold like Rivaldo during the World Cup 2002, doubling over on top of my wife, who thinks I can no longer resist her sexiness and am about to fall asleep in five minutes. “I love you”, she whispers in my ear. “I’m dying,” I croak in return.

I finally push myself to my feet, and try to make it to my phone on the TV table to call 911. It’s no good. I fall to the floor in a little ball of pain. It feels like the stomach is trying to rearrange the guts but can’t decide where everything goes. After what feels like an eternity, the crashing waves of pain start to ebb out.

My wife stands over me with a slightly worried expression. “You ok?”

“Just cramps,”  I pant as I realize what just happened to me, finally realizing why people would drown from cramps.

“Oh.” She’s quiet for a beat. “Can we go again?”

I have spent the last month getting real exercise in a gym, and taking up stretching. I’ve also realized that if I ever come close to dying, I’m properly fucked unless my wife has been too.

TLDR: The one time I didn’t please my wife it nearly killed me.

Edit: Someone gave me a “I’m deceased” award, and I want to say thank you and that this was a close one, but I’m still very much alive.

Edit2: Holy crap, this is blowing up. I’m trying to respond to all of you and the comments are a truly entertaining read! To those of you calling it a humblebrag or a boast about having sex — Hell yes I got laid! But I also try to explain that much of the time I have no idea what I’m doing, so I’m not trying to toot my own horn here. I leave the tooting of horns to my wife.

Edit3: I would like to give a big thank you to all the wonderful people who have given rewards for this post. Thank you!

As for my TLDR, a lot of people are unhappy with it. I’m sorry for that; it’s the result of being a first-time poster in this subreddit. I don’t want to change it now after the fact, but I’ll try to improve on it if I ever fuck up again."

Well it was around noon when I ate my pasta.  Shortly after that I found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.

TL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office."

I'm one of those people, where if I fall asleep I sometimes forget what I was doing before I went to sleep.

So I was playing RE7 in VR, but it was getting kinda late but I wanted to stay up and play anyways. I started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

Then I woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. BUT HOLY SHIT I JUST WOKE UP AND ALL I CAN SEE AROUND ME IS A DARK ROOM WITH SOME TABLES CHAIRS ALL I CAN HEAR ARE CREEPY NOISES AND ITS DARK OUTSIDE AND  I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM. 

So logically I stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but I'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

Somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), I also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because I wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

I start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that I didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""What the hell, are you ok?""

She took the headset off of me, and I see the destruction I did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall. 

My mom laughed her ass off at me, and told me we will talk about it tomorrow.

Maybe you already know where this is going.

My niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. They're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we'll call L), and my nephew (who we'll call W) don't have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

But imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...

&#x200B;

""A\_Sad\_Frog, can you check your bank? ""

It was my brother in law. L and W's father.

""W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200B;

My heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200B;

All told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. That's **FU number 1.**""Tell them to stop what they're doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out"".

&#x200B;

I immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can't do anything about it.

So here's where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.

I'm not mad at the kids. I genuinely don't think they meant it. I'm mad at myself. I didn't think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F'ed. We're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

So, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**TLDR:** Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. This is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. It would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **FU number 3** confirmed.

**UPDATE #1:** Playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when I can contact them."

This girl and I had a fun filled day out on the town. Afterwards we got a hotel. Things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. One thing led to another and I started fingering her. She was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that I was doing a decent job. A good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. I'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. I call her name and start panicingly shaking her. She's not responsive and I slap her face. As soon as I did this she starts having a seizure. Now I'm freaking the out. I jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. I'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. She's giving me this wtf just happened look and I tell her what happened. At first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. She said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. I just sat there in that ""thank god I didn't finger a girl to death"" state. Needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

TLDR: I fingered a girl into a seizure. She stops and says it happens sometimes."
l4jmup,TIFU by hooking up with a girl while my friend was in the house.,37031,0.74,1434,2021-01-25 14:02:15,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l4jmup/tifu_by_hooking_up_with_a_girl_while_my_friend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/l4jmup/tifu_by_hooking_up_with_a_girl_while_my_friend/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,,False,"Obligatory this didn't happen today.

So I (Chris,19M) did something stupid. Because of the Lockdown and shit, I hadn't fucked someone since 3 months, and was low-key feeling desperate and was just looking to smash. Met a girl, let's call her Maria, who was also thinking along the same lines, went on a couple of dates, blah blah blah.

So now, a little backstory. I live with a Housemate. Let's call him Mike. We both have different rooms, and it's a 2 room apartment. He and I go to nearby colleges, and we're good friends. He knows me well, and I know him well. So he likes pranking, and I like pranking too, It's okay, we get along fine.

So anyways, after our last date, I told him I'm probably gonna sleep with this girl in a couple of days.

That's what happens, Maria's in my room, things get hot and steamy, we both haven't had any contact with the other gender since a lot of time, we're making out, clothes come off, and as we start getting down to business, Mike walks in on us in the room.

And the cunt-head doesn't simple walk in. He's wearing baby clothes, has an apron on, he's holding a FUCKING ladle, he has this surprised look on his face, his hair looks like a Wasp Nest, he even has this sort of black smearing on his face, he's holding some lube and a sandwich, and you know what the asshole says? He goes 'Damn it Chris, What's wrong with you? Just as I get down to fulfilling your Fucking Ladle Fantasy (Jesus knows what that means), you go Hetero on me? I thought you swore you were gay?'

I learnt that laughing in such a Scenario isn't a good idea. She thought the laughing gave it away that I was pranking her. In my defence, it was hilarious seeing him like that.

We both are VERY straight, like literally nothing sexual has ever happened before between us, and the MF does this without the slightest HINT of a smile. Well Maria goes ' I KNEW something was off!' and simply leaves the house, even as I try explaining the shit to her. I'm simply standing there, explaining, Naked, that he's lying, but apparently the lube gave it away, and she's sure I'm messing with her, and if I try contacting her again, she'll call the fucking Police.

So that's how Mike ruined a Hook up, and how a girl thinks I'm a pranking bastard. I swore at him for at least half an hour straight, but that doesn't bring the girl back.

To add insult to the injury, he got the idea from Reddit, of all places.

TL;DR: My roommate walked in on a girl and me about to have sex, he convinced her that I was gay, and I'm lonely again.

Edit: Lots of people are saying there are many loopholes in my story. I'll address the main ones.

1. I'm 16: I dunno where y'all got this from. I noticed a post saying that I was 16 in r/teenagers.

I don't use that sub, and didn't notice. My flair over there had been set long ago. Sorry for that. I've changed it now.

2) The baby clothes: Mike is an acting major, and we both are in the Boston area. By baby clothes I meant clothes that babies wear duh.

3) Now I'm pretty sure the comments saying I was gay are jokes, but I'll clarify: I'm straight, sorry for disappointing y'all.

4) I'm a girl. I know where this one stems from. It's a meme I made. Do people not understand that a meme is a fucking MEME for gods sake? This account is a meme account, majorly. You can dig up my profile and find out that I'm a 45 year old women who came from Mars and occasionally lives in the UK and Zimbabwe while attending classes in Boston. I'll clear this. I'm a student, in an Ivy League University, about to turn 20. I'm a straight guy. Same description applies to Mike. He's majoring in theatre, and I'm majoring in Engineering. We both are tall. He's better looking. He's an extrovert, I'm in the middle you could say.

5) This is fake: I dunno, hard to believe, for sure, definitely not fake. I'm pretty sure the homies saying this is fake are all middle aged people or 14 year olds, who have forgotten how wild college was, or dunno yet how wild it is.

6) The lube: I think that it implied anal, since you need lots of lube for that. Thought it was pretty clear. I misjudged the average IQ of this sub. Sorry

7) Immature of us: Glad you realised

8) Yes we both are friends, very close ones at that. I'll clarify. We share a lot of stuff with each other.

9) We prank each other all the time, together prank others, it's a fun life.

10) I asked where he got the idea from. He got it from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fn67j/i_hear_my_house_mate_masturbating_should_i_walk/c1h5ruf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)

TL:DR: I'm not 16, I'm a straight guy, This is real and fuck you if you think it's not."

7y6bqu,TIFU By Revealing That I Had Secretly Hid In My Roomate's Closet During His Pre-Bedtime Ritual,36985,0.89,1017,2018-02-17 17:42:58,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"Obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

I lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we’ll call them Ned and Ethan. The three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. The most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out Adam Sandler’s At a Medium Pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (Everyone thinks they’re hilarious in college, I know).
The most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. But one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in Ned’s bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of Adam Sandler on my shitty Washburn 6-string. 

Trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but Ned was no random college student. Ned was the 6’3” milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. Ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. Ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. In short, Ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. So to me, that meant that whenever Ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

So I grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he’d think I had went to bed early), and snuck into Ned’s bedroom to position myself in his closet. It was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/UC2H/HMVJA37Y/FYAUC2HHMVJA37Y.MEDIUM.jpg). Ned’s bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so I’d have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and Ned, in case I accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. But directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was Ned’s computer and desk. 
Ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. Due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, I could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. The 12 inch proximity of Ned spiked my adrenaline, and I began to control my breathing. My back was pressed against coat hangers, and I had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. Ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and I had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([Artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/XmLM5Bh.png))

As Ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. Ned did not reach for his glass of water. Ned did not opt for the pajamas. Ned did not leave his desk. Ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

A million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. If I make myself known now, he’d be immensely embarrassed and angry that I had just violated his privacy. But if I *didn’t* speak up now, chances are I’d have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. So I was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while Ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. It felt like I was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

My hands began to cramp as I awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn’t generate an ounce of noise. My legs began to jitter as I compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as I waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell I was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

After Ned’s satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a Kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that I had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

Ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and I had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. All critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until I remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. But with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would I get the phone out my pocket? Somehow I did, and I texted Ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: In Ned’s closet. Was trying to do Medium Pace gag. Ned started wanking before I could start. Now I’m stuck in the closet and can’t get out. Need help.
> 
> Ethan: LOL right.
> 
> foogama: Ethan, I’m dead serious. I need you to help create a distraction for Ned so that I can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> Ethan: …we’re going to need to have a talk later.

Right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). It was 10:45pm on a Thursday, but I could hear Ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **“HELLO? WHY YES NED IS HERE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NED! NED COME HERE, PHONE FOR YOU!”** Ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. How this never raised suspicion, I’ll never know. It was a cordless phone. There was no need for Ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. But thank god he did. I bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and Ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

I was forever in debt to Ethan for saving my ass, and we never told Ned. That is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in Ned’s wedding. There was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we “found interesting” about Ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, I was convinced by Ethan to write “That he enjoys anal sex with large black women” because it would make a fun “bachelor story” over 10 years after the fact.

But of course that’s not what happened. The best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we’d be reading the bride’s, and they’d be reading Ned’s. And of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. I didn’t even know her name. I had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

The bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. Ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. He immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. I immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. Ethan and I waited for Ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. We were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – Hid in my roommate’s closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride’s best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

I've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

EDIT: Thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for Ned. Ned is a really great guy and I'm sure we'll be fine.

EDIT 2: I got ""Ethan"" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. You can [find his comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

Was talking to a girl over text for 2-3 months. We were finally gonna meet up. I figured I'd be getting some action as we have been sending pics for awhile now. Now I'm a minute man so I was very nervous about the first time being 30sec, so I stopped by a circle k on my way to meet her. In a rush I picked the one with 5 pills in one pack and took them all... I guess ur only supposed to take one.
By the time I got to her house, my heart was racing and I was very jittery. I tried to hide it as best i could. We made out a bit but nothing more, which I was glad bc I was starting to really feel weird. Idk how to describe it. As soon as I left, I got super nauseous. I pulled over and puked my guts out. So glad I left when I did. Then I drove home. I'm still puking. Stting on the toilet as I type this. Also, still jittery. Hoping theres nothing more to puke so I can try to go to bed

Tl;dr: took 5 times regular dose of gas station dick pills and now I'm puking my guts out

To cement my idiocy here, I thought I'd let everyone know that last month I became a registered nurse(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞

hi frontpage... guess it's time to delete previous post that will identify me=I

Some updates: a lot of people have asked if it worked. The answer is yes. I tried to rub one out at home after puking, and just cpuldnt get to climax. Also, I take my job very seriously. I know some of u are concerned, but my dick logic is confined to my personal life. I never felt like I cpuldnt function after puking. Some of u were very forgiving and supportive and I commend u for that. Very sweet of u. Also, to the guy that suggested to use ""speed base amphetamine"" I hope ur joking. Please take care of urself and get some help if ur not. Also, no I wont do it again, was joking when I said I would.

Last update: feeling better. Only got an hour or two of sleep. Ate breakfast. Feel queasy but not throwing up. Stomach def not happy with me. Here's pics of the package for all the people asking what I took and what's in it.[https://i.imgur.com/APF4nSD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/APF4nSD.jpg)[https://i.imgur.com/Pgn0tyU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Pgn0tyU.jpg)"
emlnqo,TIFU by not inhaling properly when smoking weed for three years,36979,0.84,3261,2020-01-10 09:42:49,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/emlnqo/tifu_by_not_inhaling_properly_when_smoking_weed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/emlnqo/tifu_by_not_inhaling_properly_when_smoking_weed/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"I’ve been smoking weed since I went off to college ~3 years ago. I always thought weed just didn’t have that much of an effect on me other than a little tingly feeling that made me slightly less anxious than I normally am. I’ve had dozens of people tell me “oh you’re not inhaling properly” blah blah. I figured at first I probably wasn’t and had each person I smoked with teach me how to inhale properly. “Take it into your lungs” or whatever. Okay...but every time I breathe in I’m taking air into my lungs right?? So why are we acting like this is something that’s hard to do...yeah I’m a fucking idiot. So I’m watching an episode of Skins (UK) yesterday and one of the characters Effie teaches someone how to smoke.  It went something like pull it into your mouth, then breathe deeper and pull it into your lungs. Something just clicked inside my dense little fucking head and I was like OH. That makes sense.

So today I’m supposed to be having a boy over and I’m feeling a bit nervous so I decide to take a couple hits of my oil pen that I’ve been hitting for MONTHS. It’s an indica cart with a high ass THC concentrate but at this point I’m under the impression that I’ve built up tolerance to it. So as I hit it I try the Effie technique (the first explanation that actually made sense to my dumbass) and I coughed so hard I almost threw up. I was like oh shit...this works. So I proceed to hit it three more times like that. Biggest fucking inhales and I felt that shit SIT in my lungs. 

FML. Next thing I know I wake up in my bed but I think I’m dreaming. I close my eyes and open them again but I’m still dreaming. I do this about 8 more times until I realize holy shit I’m not dreaming I’m tripping HARD. I literally lost an hour in which I remember nothing, and when I start remembering things nothing felt real. Everything felt like a dream or a simulation. Every time I thought it was over I’d reopen my eyes and lose my shit again. At one point I was sniffing essential oils to try to bring myself back, and at another I destroyed my room looking for something I thought would “save” me (I don’t even remember what). I was convinced I had “switched frequencies” and was now on the wrong “frequency of existence” and couldn’t get back to the “right frequency.” It took me 3 fucking hours to come back to myself and realize I wasn’t going to die. During this time I called my brother, his friend, and my mom who now think I’m losing it. Also the guy that was supposed to come over thinks I’m ghosting him now. And I’m never smoking weed again.

TL;DR: I inhaled properly when smoking for the first time, overestimated my tolerance and had the scariest trip of my life. I lost three hours during which the guy I like was waiting on me to send my address and now he thinks I’m a bitch. And now weed is ruined for me forever

Edit: I hope it’s okay that I edit! A couple things, I went to sleep and feel a lot calmer now, I’m aware my initial post was dramatic. I did not expect to wake up to this! Also, I’m aware I’m an actual idiot for not realizing how to inhale correctly. This is why I posted in this sub, so everyone commenting or messaging me calling me all sorts of names, I know!!! I’m an idiot and all I can do is learn from my mistakes. I’d really only smoked socially before and I’ve learned a lot about smoking from this thread, so thanks to everyone that commented helpful advice! Side note, in my panic I googled what to do and one of the tips was to smell something citrus like essential oil, so that’s why I did that. I don’t remember if it helped, I think maybe for a moment it made things a little bit clearer. 

Lastly, I told the guy I got “sick” and he was super understanding; we’ve rescheduled the date. I plan on telling him the whole truth in person. Thanks again to everyone giving advice or sharing similar stories! You’ve made me feel a little less stupid for this fuck up"

He lays on his side so the easiest thing to do was to give him a gentle stroke. He started stiffening but didn't really stir. He loves me licking his balls so I tried to give them a lick.

It wasn't easy without him helping to manoeuvre into the right position. I lifted his leg a bit and got a good angle. He started to stir and shift. So I sat back until he settled more on his front but still on his side. 

I was clearly in quite a determined mood and I tried to get to his balls from behind through his raised leg. 

As I was trying to get in there again he let out a massive fart. Just instantly stinky, inches from my nose. I saw it before I felt it and I felt it before I smelt it but there was nothing I could do to save myself. So gross. Wouldn't recommend! He's not even that windy. It was bad luck.

Of course he woke up hard and wanted to get going. Reader, there was no way for him to get me back in the mood that morning.

TL;DR I tried to wake my husband up by licking his balls, but he farted I'm my face."
hp24c3,TIFU by getting fully erect during an ultrasound on my balls,36918,0.84,2916,2020-07-11 07:46:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hp24c3/tifu_by_getting_fully_erect_during_an_ultrasound/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hp24c3/tifu_by_getting_fully_erect_during_an_ultrasound/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"Forewarning: This is basically going to be a horny teenager story.

About two years ago, after my physical exam, my doctor recommended that I go get an ultrasound on my testicles because he felt a mass. I went to go get an ultrasound and it was a young male doctor and everything was fine. So I thought I knew what to expect.

My parents switched insurance and now I have a different doctor. A few days ago, I went for a physical and my doctor again recommended that I go for an ultrasound. The next day, I went to go get my ultrasound and to my surprise, a young female doctor (probably a resident since she looked 27-30 years old) called my name. She introduced herself and then said, ""we're a bit short-staffed so I will be doing the ultrasound today."" My heart started racing and I was confused because I expected a male doctor since it was a checkup for my balls and didn't really want to show another female my parts. Honestly, I would have been fine with an older female doctor but the issue with her was that she was very, very, VERY attractive. She was wearing a mask but she had a great face and eyes, small boobs, a slim waist, and a PHAT ass. inb4 all the comments ""I dOn'T sEe A pRoBlEm,"" I'm a virgin male teenager with helicopter parents and ever since coronavirus, I don't get much privacy and probably haven't jacked off in 3 weeks. Now you kinda get the idea of where this is going.

We get into the room and she hands me a towel and instructs me how to use the towel to fold my penis up. The way she enunciated ""penis"" made my heart race and my head pound. She leaves the room to let me undress and I use the bathroom and see that I have a half-chub. I undress, lay down on the table, and probably went through 5 iterations of how to fold the towel over my dick to hide my half-chub. I'm laying there for a while (probably less than a minute but it seemed like 5 minutes) and reach for my phone and decide to browse Reddit while I wait. Unfortunately, the second post I scroll to is a highly upvoted post on the facefuck subreddit and I instantly go from half chub to full-blown boner. Fantastic! My mind was racing with how to get rid of it. I eventually settle on browsing buildapcsales to try to calm myself. Suddenly... knock knock! I immediately throw my phone to the chair next to me and grab both sides of the towel to pin my boner down.

I look down and could definitely see a bulge but think, ""maybe she'll just think I have a massive flaccid dick."" My mind wanders to porn mode as she sits down next to me and I start having absolutely ridiculous thoughts like ""holy shit! She's going to blow me to help ease my nerves!"" which does not help with the boner situation at all. I'm trying to think of the most unhorniest thoughts ever to try to control myself.

She starts by putting the gel on the probe and immediately gets to it. Upon contact, I think ""Oh my god, this super hot doctor is touching my balls with a probe"" and my boner is literally pulsing under the towel. I'm looking at her and she's mostly looking at her screen and typing so I reassure myself that she probably doesn't notice. ""Perfect, she's not even looking at me, I'll just hold the towel down and this will be over with."" After a bit of probing, she turns to me and says ""now I need to go up your groin area a bit so I'm going to fold the towel up and push everything to the side like this."" This all happens in slow motion. I see her hand slowly reaching for the bottom corner of the towel as she gently pries the towel from my death-grip and...... BOINGGGGGG! My fully erect dick springs up and launches the towel off, fully exposing me.

I honestly don't remember her reaction. I frantically looked at her, looked at my dick, quickly grabbed the towel and wrapped up my dick like a burrito, and for the rest of the examination, I laid there with both my hands holding my erect dick back and let her finish the ultrasound. As I'm writing this I realize I didn't even apologize to her. I was dead silent the rest of the time.

Thanks for reading my embarrassing story of the first female to see my fully erect dick. On a more serious note, I was wondering if other people who have gotten an ultrasound on their balls have also had female doctors do the ultrasound. Did you guys talk to the doctor while they were probing your balls? I'm honestly looking to hear more personal accounts from other people so I know what is ""normal"" and what to expect in the future if I ever have to get my balls checked out again.

TL;DR I went to go get an ultrasound on my balls and did not expect the doctor to be a HOT female doctor. Couldn't control my raging boner and accidentally exposed myself to her.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone so so so so much for the reassurances, personal recounts, and in general positive responses. It makes me feel much better about what happened and what to expect when I go again. I appreciate all the LPT people telling me to flex my legs or a large muscle, I'll keep that in mind for the future. It's funny because she actually told me to flex my abs a few times so maybe she was looking out for me. 

To everyone asking about my balls, my balls are fine, thanks for asking! Apparently, they are just so massive and the biggest balls they've ever seen... just playing. They actually don't know what it is or what they've been feeling. Both my doctors felt something but both ultrasounds came back fine so I'm not sure what's going on. I personally can't feel anything but I've also had these balls since I was born and I haven't really noticed anything out of the ordinary. 

To everyone saying ""Two years ago...coronavirus"" and saying I don't have my story straight. I apologize for the confusing timeline. Two years ago, I got the same ultrasound done but with a male doctor. I was just setting the precedent that I thought I knew what to expect. This story happened last week."

Because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. I always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. One person in our office is a vegetarian, I am aware of this. They passed by as another person and I were enjoying gummy bears, I quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer I was like ""oh sorry, right! You won't want these!"" 

They responded with ""Why wouldn't I?! I love gummy bears!"" I stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

Them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? Why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

Me: ""I thought all gelatin came from animals.""

Them: ""are you serious? You aren't serious right? I love gummy bears. My kid and I eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

Me (now panicking): ""I think I am. I don't know. Maybe you're right! I'm 
sorry! You're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

They now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. I swear I could see them going through the stages of grief because I know how sad I would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. So TIFU by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

TL;DR TIFU by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

Edit: omg. Front page. All you guys are awesome! And I'm learning so much! I just want to clarify a couple of items. First, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. I just happen to know their choice and respect it, I have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. Second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (Yay!). I'm excited about all the dialogue. And feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. But pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. Thanks Reddit world!

Edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. Hopefully it's a bit better now). Also, thank you for the awards!! But! It they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. Or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!"

She was very shy and would barely talk. 
Her Bestfriend kept telling me that she likes me, but I never believed her, and since the girl would always avoid talking to me I didn't even bother to make a move.
We were at a summer camp, making origamis. 
She then nervously came up to me, and handed me an origami and said here I made this one for you.

Didn't think much of it, now 5 years later I still have this Origami on my night desk. I'm going to move out in a few days, I was packing my stuff, I saw the Origami on the night shelve and picked it up. 
I noticed a little writing on the inside of the Origami.
I didn't want to spoil the Origami, but I eventually did.

 It was actually a little note. It said I really like your freckles, and you're very kind below was her number. Now I do feel very very dumb, not really because I missed the chance, but because she must have thought all this time that I ignored her etc. 
We still follow eachother on instagram, but Idk if I should hit her up.
I just want to punch my face into the wall, 
I missed such a great opportunity, should have listened to her friend :/

Btw I'm 22 rn I'm not quite sure how old she ist but I think 20-21.
TL:DR

*UPDATE*

It's currently 11 o'clock. I send her a message on Instagram, she replied. We chatted for a bit, and then it was sort of awkard, I explained to her how I just found the message, and that I thought it was a nice gesture. Surprisingly she was quite ecxited and happy, didn't expected that.
She immediately asked me, If I wanted to get coffe today at around 17 o'clock.

I'm not sure If I'll be able to go today, since I'm still at the hospital, and they're taking soo long, but if I do I'll definitely keep you guys updated on how it went.

(Plus, Never realized how much of an impact a compliment could have, personnaly I never liked my freckles, since they basically cover my whole face, and I never met someone who liked them either. Knowing that someone thinks they look good honestly made my day. Just wanted to share)


*UPDATE*

We met an hour earlier than expected, luckily I  got out of hospital in time. The weather was nice, so we decided to meet at the parc, and bought Iced coffe.
While I was texting with her a few hours prior, she sounded really confident etc, but when I met her, she was still super shy.
She was very nice, but yeah didn't talk much.
 A few hours In she did start to open up a bit and get talkative.
We went to an Asian resturant, ( All you can eat).
And damn I must say, she really took All you can eat to another level, she understood the assignment, and was out there trying every dish, I think the waitresses where on the edge of kicking us out lol.

Afterwards, she didn't seem shy anymore, we went over to my place, and y'all I honestly need to shit so bad, but I can't. Anyways we're currently watching a movie, and her head is on my shoulder, that's a good sign I guess. I need to put my phone away now.


Btw her Bestfriend texted me saying I told ya, didn't I?"

She’s super terrific to me, and I really think things are going better than they’ve gone in my most recent relationships. We met on Tinder! I personally deleted Tinder two weeks after meeting her because I was that into her. She told me she did the same about two weeks after that. However, a recent Instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. Figured I’d look at it, because we had each other on other social media’s (and I was curious)
BIG MISTAKE

She’s got a substantial amount of followers and notes, but I’ve noticed all she talks about is her ex and how she’s in love with him, and other Tinder guys she’s gone on dates with. We started playing video games together recently, and I’ve just found out that her interest in them came from a guy she just spent last weekend with. 

She has no idea I know any of this information, and I’m too into her to say anything. Please help! What do I do?

Newly obligatory this will not end in incest. I didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.

&#x200B;

It's a perfect summer night in 2018. I'm leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200B;

Last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200B;

MAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I'm being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I ""want both"" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.

&#x200B;

Next thing I know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.

&#x200B;

My drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&#x200B;

I launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* You're so much better than him.
* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn't deserve you.
* You'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&#x200B;

I'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. 

&#x200B;

No, he fucking ***DIED.***

&#x200B;

The guy died in a car accident and I'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I was invited back to a girl's house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she's better than him, etc. He didn't break up with her, he fucking died."
bonrm0,TIFU by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.,36701,0.86,1863,2019-05-15 01:31:27,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bonrm0/tifu_by_not_closing_the_tab_of_porn_on_my_phone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bonrm0/tifu_by_not_closing_the_tab_of_porn_on_my_phone/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. 

So, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

I brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it’s only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven’t had a good release since a week. 

I take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

I reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

The invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

I try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won’t get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

Soon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. 

One of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.

 She stares at me and picks up my phone. 

“You seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?” She said. 

“I am not. It’s an honest mistake.” 

Then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she’ll let me go. 

My heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

My heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There’s nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. 

“Cheating from a video?” She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

There it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

The professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. 

Now I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. 

Anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. 


TL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn’t allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

Edit : 

1. For the people who think this is fake. It is not.   
                                                         
2.  For people who are saying why was I failed and now need to produce an apology one even though I wasn’t cheating - It is because in India these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. Also, I only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. The porn was Manuel Ferrara and Dani Daniels, they don’t have much together. You will easily get it with one search on PornHub. If I may suggest something much more better, please try Manuel Ferrara and The Goddess Remy LaCroix. The video starts with them talking about cup or something. That also is easily available. 

4. About the girl who asked for the link. 

I was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

The girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. As she came outside she asked me why did I bring a phone to the exam and even if I did, I could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. I said I could have but my I couldn’t think at that time and was afraid. 

After that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. The girl accompanied me to the admin office. I accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

It was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. She asked to show me what was the video while giggling and I thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. She started laughing and told me I am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. Then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. She remembered my name and my Department. Then we parted ways. 

For fuck's sake, she is cute. Stop telling me to pursue her. I have another exam later. Maybe will meet her there. 


The Indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

Edit 2: Man I have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. I have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

Thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. I haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

Edit 3: Invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. In fact, that is the word for Exam Proctor here in India borrowed down from the time when we had a case of Britishers. 

Thanks for the Gold and Silver again. Open some sort of privileged Sub-Reddits I think."

So this happened over 10 years ago but still gets me nauseated when I think about it

I just started college and was on a full scholarship after working hard and completing many interviews and references to get this highly competitive scholarship. 

In one of my classes the was a stunningly beautiful woman who came to me asking questions all the time about the course we're on and we also end up being study partners in some group tasks. I was very much attracted to her and she seemed to enjoy my company so one day I asked her out for dinner date and to my delight she accepted. 

Being a poor college kid, I did not have much money, but I did not want to go to a horrible chain restaurant, so I booked restaurant in the next town that had decent reviews but hopefully was not overly expensive. The dinner was going well we were having a very animated conversation and the food was very good. The restaurant was almost empty but and other large group people on the other side of the restaurant. But I was a bit nervous on how much the bill will be and did not want to get caught being not able to pay the bill but alas this was the least of my problems to come.

In the restaurant a group of people were on the other side of the restaurant had one uncontrolled child approx. three or four years old running around unsupervised. The waitress was getting really upset with him and the group as he was disturbing other tables and pulling cutlery from other tables and the parents didn't seem to be concerned with his behavior. But he wasn't really disturbing me as I was having a great time with my date and I ignored the antics of the child. 

My date and I ordered dessert and I excused myself to go to the bathroom, while in the bathroom I could hear the small child making motorbike noises running around in the bathroom for a few seconds before exiting. I didn't see him as I was facing the urinal, and he had left by the time I turned around to wash my hands. I proceeded back to my table when dessert had just been served. During dessert, my date commented that the other table were the child belongs to seemed to be staring at us in a funny way. My back was to them, but again I was having a great time and did not care if another group was staring at us or not.

After we finished dessert, I was surprised to see the restaurant lit up with the blue and red lights of a police car. A lady from the other table in which I now know is the mother of the child went out and met with the officers and then led them to my table and pointed to me and stared ""here is the man that assaulted my son."" 

I was completely shocked! I told the child's mother that I had absolutely nothing to do with her son and never spoken or touched him. She told in the offices that I exposed myself to him while he was in the bathroom. She explained to the police that her son said to her “I saw that man’s wee”, when I walked past their table from the bathroom. There were two police officers one male one female officer, the male officer led me outside for more questioning female stayed inside talking to the mother. 

I explained to the police that I when I went to the bathroom, I heard the kid come into the bathroom for a few seconds, but I didn't see him, and he was gone by the time I washed my hands. I never spoke to him or talked to him or even look at him in the bathroom, the police officer took notes, and the female officer came out and advised I was under arrest and they will take me to the police station for further investigation. The mother out the front of restaurant is yelling at me that I was a pervert and I need to be locked up.

My date made a brief statement to the police. She ended up paying and catching a cab home and I got a free ride to the police station. 

At the police station the officer advised that according to the mother, the child uses the word “wee” as a euphemism for penis and the mother have made a formal complaint that I exposed my penis to the child while I was in the bathroom. I gave my own statement advising that I was “weeing” in the bathroom, the mother was not there and yes the child must of seen my back whilst I was urinating as that's what I was doing in the toilet at the time- there was no way he saw my penis in the few seconds when he ran in unsupervised and out. Nevertheless, the police charged me with indecent exposure to a child under 12.

This being a small town I got locked up for the weekend because there was no judge available to grant bail on the weekend.  I rang my father explaining the situation and he arranged lawyer to appear with me on Monday. I basically had no sleep for 2 1/2 days in the lockup and I was still wearing my restaurant clothes for my Monday court appearance. My lawyer petitioned the judge for the charges to be dropped as if we locked up everyone who went to a public bathroom in the presence of someone under the age of 12 then we would have to lock up the whole country. The judge agreed and the charges were dropped, and I could go home. 

But the damage had been done, my date told her girlfriends what happened as if she was the victim of a horror date and then her friends who then told the whole college that I exposed myself to young children. The next day everyone was staring me in class some people coming up to me asking what happened some people no longer go near me or talk to me as the rumor mill was on fire. My date never spoke to me again.

2 weeks later I had to front the college board and had to defend an honor code violation as my scholarship was now in jeopardy.  Though cleared this incident hung like a dark cloud over my time in college being a social outcast and severely curtailed my social and professional life in my early 20’s not to mention having a hefty legal bill being sent to my parents.


Tl;DR– I got arrested for indecent exposure just for urinating in a restaurant bathroom"

At this time, I will be away from my wife and we will both be not having sex until i come home (sometime in December). It is also important to state that I have some heart issues and am currently on blood thinners.

I want to prep to have some mind blowing sex when I come home, so I have been ""training"" to hold my orgasm.

Over the weekend i had to make a long drive and didn't have time to give it a wank. Today was the first time since thursday (4 days) with no wank.

I went to the bathroom to do the deed and decided to lay in the filled tub while doing it.

After edging for 55 minutes, I crossed the point of no return. I could feel an immense pressure build up, and I inadvertently aimed my rifle at myself.

 The pressure from no wanks and the edging turned my first part of the load into a mach 1 projectile. This projectile shot right to my eye, and I literally gave myself a facial. But then it got worse - my eye started burning and I could feel my contact fold into my eye lid.

I panicked to get out of the tub to a towel, and ended up slipping on the tile and whacking my head on the edge of the tub. The next moment I am laying on the ground, dried cum on my face and eye, and something sticky on my head.

From whacking my head on the tub, i cracked my head open and there was blood everywhere. I could still feel the blood wet on the back of my head and I felt sticky all over. Then suddenly I was getting very dizzy. I crawled out of my room and pounded on my door asking for help.

Next time I woke up, I was in an ambulance heading to the hospital. One of the service maids heard me pounding on the door and opened the door to see me naked and covered in blood and she called 911 (according to the EMTs).

The EMT said I was lucky I made it to the door, since I was losing alot of blood still (there was a small pool by the door). He also said he ""cleaned up the blood and other secretions from my face.""

So here I am, leaving the hospital, knowing that the hotel staff and paramedics saw me covered in blood after giving myself a facial.

TLDR: edged too hard, rubbed it out, blasted eye with cum and slipped on tile floor trying to get a towel.hit head and almost died of blood loss due to blood thinners.

Sorry if this is ramble-y, I am very much so mentally lost from the crazy ride today.

EDIT #1: hey guys, I talked to my boss and he is sending someone out to relieve me from work for a month. I was told to work remotely at home while I rest and recover. 

To the people asking for pictures of my head, I'll have my wife take pictures when I am home.

I learned a lot about VHS tapes that day and that if you are careful you can transplant that tape into the case of an advertisment VHS tape for crash bandicoot I had received because I was cool and subscribed to nintendo power. Damn Im a genius! It was fappin time and I went to town. It was the perfect hiding spot too! Nobody suspected a thing but eventually I got the internet and the VHS tapes got put in a box and forgotten about. Fast forward to now and my mom is a volunteer driver for people that need rides to the hospital. This job allows here to interact with many types of people. She meets this sweet lady that fosters kids and mentions she has a ton of old VHS tapes the kids might enjoy. 1 week after my mom gives her the tapes the lady calls my mom back and is furious. She had put the Crash Bandicoot tape on and started making dinner in the next room. Those kids learned a few new things about life that day. As you would expect my mom called me very confused and I had to akwardly explain to her how my horny adolescent ingenuity caused this to happen over 2 decades ago.

So a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I'm learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. She's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
She kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she's what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that's when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

Her face fell. It's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I've been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. I don't think I'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

TLDR: I decided to be sexy and asked my gf if I made her moister than an oyster. She doesn't think oysters are sexy."

When I was around five I made this new friend, let's call him Tim, who had the coolest stuff. I would go to his house to play and we were becoming pretty good friends. His house was awesome. His dad had a sweet computer we could use with games, and he just happened to have this HUGE glass container filled with some really dope marbles. 

So one day we bust out the marbles and start rolling them into each other, as you do, and everything is going normally. Just two normal kids playing with marbles. We were playing with a whole set of different colours, patterns and sizes. There were gigantic ones and tiny little ones. Unfortunately the marbles began to induce a kind of childlike creativity they didn't deserve. 

To us, being five year olds in the late 90s, asses and toilet humour were some of the funniest things you could conceive. Somehow a connection was made between those smooth-ass marbles and our smooth-ass asses. A simple connection but one that would come with repercussions. 

An idea was conceptulised and there was no turning around. We thought it would be hilarious to put a marble right up inside one of our tiny little asses. 

Thankfully it wasn't mine... 

After much of a struggle Tim managed to squeeze a small marble into himself and upon realising it wouldn't come back out, began bawling his eyes out, having to be driven to the hospital by his mum to have the said marble removed from his anus. 

Needless to say, I got in a LOT of shit. I was banned from ever going around to Tim's house again and I don't remember ever seeing him again to be honest.

TL;DR: Today (around 23 years ago) I lost a friend, and my friend lost a marble"
ef2ivm,TIFU by buying a car with heated seats that burnt my ass (and pelvic bone). I have to lay on my stomach for 3 months and will miss Xmas and NYE stuff.

 This happened two weeks ago, I’ve just left hospital but have to spend the next three months (at least) on my stomach in bed. I’m planning on using that time to ~~learn a new language~~ look at memes. 

**Marked NSFW because I’ll link a photo of the burn on my ass in my tl:dr below.**

I’ve been a paraplegic since a military accident in 2004. I’ve always lived independently and taken very good care of myself and my ass because sitting-pressure plus lack of sensation, and decreased blood flow in paralysed areas can cause pressure sores that never heal, and I like to be as active as possible. 

So I check my skin every day with a mirror or phone camera (belfie), change position, lift myself to allow blood flow etc. I spent a lot of time in hospital following my initial injury and saw guys living with open weaping sores that never heal, it terrified me (search for “pressure sore paraplegic” if you enjoy being disgusted) and I’m proud to say I’ve never had a pressure sore because I’m so careful, despite skiing, kayaking, and even paragliding still. 

Basically I’m a dumbass with a numbass, but I look after it... normally. 

I had an *open-book* pelvic fracture when I was hurt back in 2004, and quite a few other problems at the same time so they put me back together in a bit of a rush whilst idk ... resuscitating me and stuff. My pelvis is now tilted down to one side, when I sit it’s considerably lower and bears all the weight. The leg on that side looks 3 inches longer than the other. 

As I sat in my car for a three-hour drive home that side of my pelvis must have been pushing directly onto the heated element within the seat. Even though it wasn’t hot enough to burn immediately, I suffered a “low-heat” burn after three hours. Which is *way* worse than it sounds. 

I could feel the heat on my lumbar region and never thought it would be able to burn me, I even turned the heat to the low setting to be careful. 

That night I checked my skin and found my worst nightmare.  Which got worse. What initially looked superficial developed a softball sized blister overnight that burst to show something looking like an effect from the walking dead. 

Two weeks later and the first layers of dead tissue are starting to lift, the skin is healing. Now I just have to worry about osteomyelitis. 


**TL;DR** An injury 15 years ago messed up my pelvis so badly that when I drive it pushes directly into a heating element in my new car’s seats. A three hour long drive burned my ass as a result (possibly bone) and I’ll be spending 3 months it so laying on my stomach while it heals. 

NSFW link to pics of my skinny, burnt ass:

Two weeks later with healing and necrosis:

*Edit:* The bum burning car is a **2019 Ford Focus Active X**, UK model. 

I’m sorry some of you clicked the pic links expecting to see a girl’s ass but feel that’s a lesson you needed to learn. I’m happy so many people have seen my ass though, am I a “thot” now?"

My wife loves Christmas songs, and she looooves to sing them. 15 Years ago, we were on a holiday car ride and she decided to pass the time by singing ""The Christmas Song"" over, and over again, and me being me decided to fuck with her just to be funny.

When she got to ""Jack Frost nipping at your nose"", I blanched and asked her why she was singing THAT song, in an absolutely mortified voice.

When she looked confused, I feigned surprise that she was unaware of her faux pas and proceeded to  inform her that like many a Grimm's Fairy Tale, Christmas songs often have a dark past and that ""Jack Frost"" was the name of a mental patient from the 20's who broke out of an Asylum during a Christmas break and went around devouring faces, particularly noses, to which he had acquired a taste for.

She bought it hook, line, and sinker. She was shocked, horrified that people would sing about it, and we talked about it for the duration of the ride, Jack Frost's antics growing darker and darker as the miles flew by.

Fast-forward to this morning: I'm in a good mood, it's super snowy, and I have snow-blow the driveway. As I'm getting dressed, I start singing ""The Christmas song"" and she chastises me in a teasing voice.

I had NO idea what she was talking about. She then confides that Jack Frost, the serial nose biter had forever ruined that song for her, and she can no longer stand it.

I laugh and explain that I was teasing that day, and I honestly didn't think she believed me.

She got mad. MAD mad.

Apparently, this has been her go-to-fact during the holidays, and for the last 15 years has shared this dark and gruesome tidbit with anyone who would listen. I guess a sea of confused and disbelieving looks and a flashback of people staring at her as if SHE were a nose biter came back to haunt her as the lie she had been spreading for years came back in a moment of dawning comprehension.

She's mad and a little hurt, and I am apparently the King of Lies who is never to be trusted again.


TL;DR - I told my wife that a Christmas song was about a serial face eater, and she spread that gospel like it was handed down on a stone tablet.

*edited a word that spellcheck didn't like - ALSO, thank you for all the awards, well wishes, and what not. She's forgiven me, feels stupid, and now...I have to explain to her what Reddit is, and how this is my top submission, so I'm not out of the doghouse yet.*

*Next Morning EDIT:  All is well. She loves me, should have expected this from me as I have a tendency to lean towards mischief, and even laughed about Reddit AND Newsweek. All is good, there will be no divorce, I'm sorry that I'm basically Satan from the small group of you requesting that I kill myself for a good-natured teasing, and those of you who claim that you'd never marry me because I'm a manipulative asshole, you've never seen me dance. You would. You SO would.*"

Obligatory didn’t happen today - happened in 2000. I was 12. My mom was annoyed at my brother (2.5 yrs younger than me) for some reason and me being ever helpful decided that I would take care of the situation, so for Mother’s Day I decided the best course of action would be to just get rid of him.

I posted my brother on eBay &amp; after a few days and several bids I managed to sell him to someone in Taiwan for $17.

Don’t ask me how in the hell I managed to do this and not get it taken down - looking back I can’t make sense of it.

So once I sold him I then was faced with a thought that hadn’t crossed my 12 year old mind - how am I going to ship him?? So I ignored it because according to the internet what I did was illegal. And what better way to make something go away than to just ignore it?

2 weeks later I’m thinking I’m in the clear because I just stopped getting on eBay and again my 12 year old brain thinks nobody knows me and I’ll never have to think about this again (what’s an IP address?!) until my family and I are eating dinner and there’s a knock at the front door. I instantly got nervous because nobody uses that door so it must be serious or someone we don’t know.

My dad comes back into the kitchen a few minutes later and tells my brother to go to his room.. and for me to follow my dad. I walk into the family room to have a seat in front of two state police and the states version of FBI.

eBay reported me to the state police &amp; my IP address was acquired - they were not however expecting a 12 year old girl to walk into the room as their culprit.

I got a slap on the wrist &amp; a formal ban from eBay until I was 18 - and a very very long talk from the feds about what I had done.

EDIT: this seems to cause some confusion - when I say FEDs, it was the states computer crime task force (federally funded department)

EDIT 2: I fessed up immediately- my parents were questioned of course but I showed the computer crimes people what I did & took full responsibility.

TL;DR when I was 12 I sold little brother on eBay, didn’t know how to ship him. Ignored it. FEDs showed up &amp; got banned from eBay."

I'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. Starting this job it was no different.

Now, a few weeks later I'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. Somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. My manager named a few and I said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

Then I jokingly said, 'And nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

My co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. She raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. It was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

I guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

**TL:DR** Joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement. Tension on the workplace ever since have been, so to call, quite high. "
f2856v,TIFU by shaving my butt,36511,0.85,2449,2020-02-11 18:44:16,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f2856v/tifu_by_shaving_my_butt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f2856v/tifu_by_shaving_my_butt/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"I'm a dude. I got a little carried away with personal grooming time. My usual mindset is along the lines of ""trim the grass but don't scorch the earth,"" and I'm not really into body shaving. But I had the brilliant idea that maybe a non-hairy butt might be something nice to explore, so on a whim, I decided to give it a go.

I failed to take into consideration what a massive undertaking this would turn out to be. Even if you're normal-sized, your butt is bigger than you think. It's not like shaving your face, where there's a relatively small amount of surface that needs actual shaving. A butt represents a decent-sized parcel of real estate. And even if you're not super hairy, the hair is probably widespread, which means you probably have to shave the whole thing.

With my face, I get maybe two or three swipes of the razor before I have to rinse off the blade. With my butt, as it turns out, I get about half a swipe before the razor is full. And I mean full in a ""rinse it off, oops that didn't work, I guess I'm going to have to swipe backward against a washcloth or towel and then rinse it off some more"" kind of a way. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to throw out this washcloth because even after washing it, it still has the appearance of my grandparents' shag carpet.

Also, even if you're flexible, your butt's kind of difficultly positioned and awkward to reach. I had to keep reminding myself which way I was going, and at some point, I developed a very real fear that I was accidentally going to do a sideways swipe instead of a vertical swipe, which would disastrous for obvious reasons.

Then, at some point, you have to make a decision: Am I only shaving the outside? Or do I go, uh, between the pages? In my ongoing brilliance, I decided that shaving just the outer cheeks would only serve to make the inside appear that much hairier, so I parted the fold and continued inward. This, it turns out, is a different undertaking altogether. Skin that never sees the light of day is, understandably, much more sensitive. Also, by this time I was sweating from nervousness, and it helps nothing to also now have the potential for losing my grip on the razor.

It took probably 45 minutes altogether, and by the time I finished this somewhat harrowing project, I was feeling pretty accomplished.

I wasn't done, however, with my string of bad decisions. Aftershave was a terrible, horrible idea. I only had a minute or two of enjoying my nice, smooth butt before I decided something along the lines of, ""Now let's make this smooth skin feel like someone set it on fire."" It took a solid half-hour for the burning sensation to subside. And by then, there was no real enjoyment over my achievement, just a relief that my ass no longer felt ablaze.

And that brings us to the final experience, which is the ongoing consequence of this particular grooming experiment. You know how each of us sort of learns the best way to position yourself so you can stifle a fart? Shaving your butt changes all of that drastically. You will never fart quietly with a shaved butt, and I do mean never. About an hour or so after I had finished, I dropped a normal-sized fart without really thinking about it. The sound visibly startled me. It was like someone fired a machine gun in an echo chamber. Anyone within earshot will clearly hear the unmistakable sound of your butt cheeks slapping against each other. And without hair to provide an easy exit, you will feel the little gas bubbles as they slowly work their way up your butt crack, like the carbonation bubbles on a Sprite that you've poured into a glass. Every fart since then has been a very similar experience, and I now suspect this will continue until the hair grows back.

I guess it was worth doing in the sense of, ""Well, now I know what that's like."" But I can't say I recommend the experience, and I'm certainly never planning to do it again.

TL;DR Shaved my butt. Was difficult. Used aftershave, which set my ass on fire. Can never fart silently again.

Edit: To those of you sending me private messages, I am 100% not going to send you a photo of my butt. I'm flattered, but it's not happening. Not even for ""science"" or for ""education."" My story in text form is as far as I'm willing to go. You all are hilarious, though!

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!

Final Edit: I can't even begin to thank you all for the ridiculous amount of awards, comments, messages, and hilarity. This has been the highlight of my 7 years on Reddit. You all are the best!"

Long story short, I forgot my own birthday. 

Yeah yeah I know it’s weird, had a little bit of a ruff childhood and my birthday was either never celebrated or forgotten well….both. So as I grew older I forgot about it myself, I mean we never did anything and what not so who cared. 

Now I’m married with a wonderful women who’s very thoughtful *but* she always does some kind of party or date on my birthday. But sometimes I still forget, so today I came home early from work to surprise my wife….who was surprising me. 

I walked in quietly, and I saw her in the kitchen, with flour and cake mix on her forehead and tapestries, birthday cups flowers and gifts around the table. She was making a cake, for a surprise party. *my* surprise birthday. 

My mouth dropped and I quietly walked backwards to the door, exiting quietly and waiting till 7:30 to come back home. My wife would be so sad and she was workin so hard😅.

So within to time frame of about 3 and a half hours, I practiced my “oh my god I’m so suprised face” 

When I came home she yelled “surprise!!” And I did a very crappy surprise face hugged her and we had a movie marathon. 

This secret will never come out. But I think this was the best birthday ever. I find this kinda funny😂. I will be taking this secret to my grave. 

TL;DR i forgot my own birthday, came home from work early to surprise my wife and my wife was making a cake, for *my* surprise birthday. Whoops!"

I like shrooms and usually I'm a 2g shroom guy, but yesterday I wanted to see what 4g would do. I asked my gf to be my trip sitter just in case I decided to Peter Pan off the balcony or something. At the time my gf seemed really keen. She even joked about getting popcorn, which she actually did. 

She ran out of popcorn more or less the same time she ran out of enthusiasm. I spent most of the night doing an invisible hula hoop dance and laughing hysterically. The higher dose definitely hit different. My gf said it was getting late and wanted us to go to bed. We ended up in bed and my gf eventually fell asleep. I was still wide awake and unable to stop touching my Adam's apple every time I swallowed. 

My gf woke up to me standing on the bed completely naked and continuing to do the invisible hula hoop dance. She grabbed a blanket and left the bedroom. I have no idea how long I was dancing on the bed, but I must have exhausted myself and passed out because I remembered nothing else afterwards other than waking up alone in bed this morning and finding my gf sleeping in the living room. 

When my gf opened her eyes, I was standing by with breakfast and an apology, which my gf was grateful for. However, she broke up with me. Last night was ""too much frat boy"" for her liking. Apparently she expected an ""older guy"" like me to be more mature. I'm 22. She's 19. What the fuck. Anyway, she left. I really liked her.

As any parent does, I tell my son to give me all his dirty laundry (mostly so I don’t have to touch it) so I can wash them for him. 

One day he was not home, so, I went into his room and grabbed his dirty laundry. I notice a balled up towel in the corner of his closet and I just grabbed the end of it, thinking it was just a towel, nope! Out falls 2 of my girlfriends recently worn/dirty underwear! I stand there coming up with crazy scenarios in my head for a second like “must have gotten caught in the towel when he was done showering” or “maybe it got messed up in the clean laundry”. Then the realization hits me that our laundry basket is in the bathroom where we shower. 

All I could say to my girlfriend was “we are about to have a weird conversation and I’m sorry”. I pull out the underwear and say “I found these in (insert son’s name) room” and her jaw just drops. 
I didn’t know what else to say besides “at least we know he likes you”

Now it is a little weird and quiet around my house. The worst part is, I don’t know how to bring it up to him!

TL;DR: found my girlfriend’s underwear in my teenage son’s bedroom when I was just looking for laundry. Now there is a weird silence when my girlfriend encounters my son.

UPDATE 1: The decision has been made to sit him down tonight after dinner. Im going to be short and sweet about it. Tell him that I’ll love him no matter what. Tell him why it wasn’t ok to violate my GFs privacy! Then take the opportunity to see if he wants to talk about anything, but not force him to. 

OFF TOPIC: To the guy who messaged me asking to trade my girlfriends dirty underwear for his SISTERS! You’re disgusting!

UPDATE 2: Ok, so here is the update everyone is waiting for! First of all, my decision was not based off any “bro code”. I feel it is my job to mold the best young man. Also, to those suggesting that I should not have told my girlfriend, her privacy was invaded and it’s only right she knows. If he didn’t want to be embarrassed about it, he shouldn’t have done it. I decided to talk to him about it when it was time to drag the trash barrels out to the street. After we each dragged a barrel and we’re walking back I said “listen buddy, I’ll love you no matter what, BUT I found what was in your bedroom in the towel. You’re lucky it was me who found it and not her! That’s extremely inappropriate and not ok, do not ever invade a woman’s privacy like that. Especially, not a girl who has never consented to you in a sexual way. Do we understand each other?!”

He just dropped his head and said “sorry dad” and I just completely dropped it and said “don’t forget the last barrel and went inside.

UPDATE 3: here are some of the messages I’ve gotten! 

“I’ve been in a similar position”  
Either by sons or moms that have gone through this, THANK YOU to these people! Perspective truly helps in situations like these! 

“Does your GF have onlyfans” 😂🤔😟
She better not!!! 

“What he is doing is normal. Please leave him alone” 
No, I appreciate your opinions though! 🤥

“You’re a terrible father for not talking to him right away” or “you’re a terrible father for talking to your GF about it” 
I think figuring out the best move is better then reacting with angry emotions right away!"
ec2wh8,TIFU by cheating on my SO and karma came FAST,36327,0.87,950,2019-12-18 03:41:23,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ec2wh8/tifu_by_cheating_on_my_so_and_karma_came_fast/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ec2wh8/tifu_by_cheating_on_my_so_and_karma_came_fast/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"This actually happened about 10 years ago and we split up because of it. Before I go any further I want to point out that I am fully aware of how shitty and inexcusable cheating is. I was young and made a mistake that I paid for immediately. This is my story.

So one night my room mate invited me (21 years old at the time) to the beach to see a bunch of people that we knew from high school and hadn't seen since graduation. We had spent all night in the bar drinking and taking shots. Eventually the bar closes so me, my room mate and the remaining members of our group decided to grab the coolers from our friends hotel and head towards the water to finish the night off with a few more beers and listen to the water. The waves seemed to be appearing from a void. This is about the time things took a turn.

We had been debating getting in the water, but this is not very smart at night especially when you don't know the schedule of the tide, plus we were absolutely shit faced. I was the first one to start heading that way, removing my clothes down to my underwear, when one of the girls we were with sprints past me. I turn around and everyone is naked. I admit that at this point I had not even considered how my girlfriend would have felt about this, and I got naked too. We had been swimming for about 30 minutes when everyone started splitting up. This was during low tide so you could go quite a ways away from shore and still be waist deep. I had come up to a sandbar with this girl that I had been friends with for years. Neither of us had even realized how far away we had strayed from the group or the shore. This is the moment I cheated. About halfway through the deed I heard my room mate screaming our names at the top of his lungs. We were the only ones left out there and the tide was coming in. We made it only a few feet from the sandbar when I noticed what looked like fireflies in the water. I quickly realized that these were jellyfish and they were EVERYWHERE! We both frantically tried to hurry through but they just kept coming. There were at least 50-75 that we could see. Suddenly I felt a sharp sting across the back of both knees. I grabbed my friend by the wrist and started to pull her as I did my best to run because now shit had gotten serious. I made the one mistake that every beach goer knows better than to do. I decided we needed to get out immediately and climbing the rocks would help. I didn't even get a single foot planted because my toe was immediately sliced open to the bone by a clam. Now I'm naked, pouring blood, and both of us had been stung all over. We started back towards the beach when I was doubled over in pain shooting through my penis and balls. I thought I had been bitten by something, but it turns out a jellyfish had wrapped around my genitals. I had never been in pain like this before. When we finally got to the beach we were surrounded by all of our friends who heard us screaming and had called the police because they thought we had come across a shark. It's now almost 5 am and the experience had completely sobered me up. The police were surprisingly cool about the whole situation and one of them offered to walk us back to the hotel.

Fast forward to later in the morning when my room mate had driven us home. When we got home I started evaluating my injuries, I definitely needed stitches, but opted out because I didn't have insurance at the time. My penis looked horrendous however. I couldn't even believe what this jelly fish had done to it. It was swollen, tender and was a different shape. I took a handful or Ibuprofen and took a shower before passing out for the remainder of the day until the evening when I wake up to my girlfriend crawling in the bed with me. My heart sank. She knew I had gone out the night before, and my room mate informed her of my rough night excluding the fact that I betrayed her. She was there for maybe a total of 10 minutes before I completely broke down and confessed, but did not tell her about the cut or the jelly fish. She never looked at me, never cried and left without saying anything. I saw her about 4 years ago in a bar. She approached me and asked if we could talk for a while. She told me that she was never mad at me and that after some time she was just happy I was honest (after the fact she noted). To which I replied, ""well I've got something else to tell you about that night that you're going to love."" She fucking loved every second of hearing the rest of the events from that night. We laughed pretty hard about it. I paid for her tab and left. We haven't spoken since.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I cheated on a very good girl and was stung on the dick by a jelly fish immediately after."
uyh8uc,TIFU by eating the hottest peppers I could find while having no sense of taste or smell due to COVID.,36224,0.92,1276,2022-05-27 02:23:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uyh8uc/tifu_by_eating_the_hottest_peppers_i_could_find/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uyh8uc/tifu_by_eating_the_hottest_peppers_i_could_find/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"My FU happened 3 days ago and I’ve just now recovered enough to relive it. 

I got COVID for the second time over the weekend and by Monday I had lost all sensation of taste and smell. At the peak of the pandemic I’d joked with my brother in law about running a hot pepper gauntlet if I ever lost my sense of taste and smell from COVID because I *heard* you could handle spicy things. 

Mind you, I’ve always loved spicy things, but habaneros are usually the hottest I can go. So I started with those, because why not?  And nothing. So I thought, let’s just jump right into one called the Death Spiral, which is hotter than a ghost pepper but not as hot as a Carolina Reaper. 

This is the moment where I think I can pinpoint where my fuck up happened. Nothing. No taste, no spice. So I IMMEDIATELY threw two Carolina reaper peppers down followed by about 10-15 pieces of habaneros and death spiral peppers. About halfway through, my body started to retaliate. I was sweating. I was numb, I felt like I was going to die. But the burn wasn’t there. Until it was. It’s hard to describe. 

Anyway, I suffered through the night with awful indigestion and took antacids to try to calm it.  I was miserable. 

I didn’t think it could get any worse, but then the moment came where I had to evacuate them. And my god, the pure fire and rage that my sphincter had was unbearable. It felt like satan himself was trying to claw his way out of my rectum. I swore I’d shat blood, but there was none. For hours afterwards I swear the fire feeling that came from my exit hatch could have made s’mores for the entire family. I’m still in pain days later. 

TL;dr - lost taste and smell due to COVID, thought it was a good idea to eat the hottest peppers I could find. Paid the price when satan escaped from my ass. 0/10, would not recommend.

Eventually we exchanged instagram accounts after which she asked if I wanted to have video sex on hangouts. She's a pretty girl and we had a good time. Or so I thought...

This afternoon I received a message from her saying she recorded everything and she wants me to pay €500 or else she'd send the video to all my contacts. I'm not the guy to start to panic so I called the police for advice. They told me to block her so that she can't send me threats anymore so that's what I did. I came up with the idea to post on my social media that if anyone receives a video of me to not open it because I am being blackmailed.

But to do that I first had to inform my parents. So i'm calling my mom. She says i'm very dumb but she appreciates me informing her. She then passes the phone to my father so I can explain myself to him. He asks if i'm just naked on the video, or if i'm performing any ""actions"" to which I respons; well yeah, i'm beating my meat of course.

So now i'm waiting for someone to tell me that they received a video of me masturbating while having to explain myself to everyone who is concerned for me because of my post.

tldr; had video sex with a stranger, am now being blackmailed. I've had to tell my father that I'm choking my chicken on the video.

EDIT: a lot of people are asking me how she got my contacts; she copied a list of all my followers on instagram. She also showed me proof of the recording. And for an update: no video has reached me or my friends yet.

EDIT2: I can't keep up with the comments anymore. A lot of people are telling me their stories of how they got blackmailed. We're all a bunch of horny idiots, aren't we? I wish all the best luck to anyone who is or has been in a similar situation. Stay safe kids"
htcbd3,TIFU by mistaking Tom Holland for an extra,36198,0.9,1062,2020-07-18 12:23:34,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/htcbd3/tifu_by_mistaking_tom_holland_for_an_extra/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/htcbd3/tifu_by_mistaking_tom_holland_for_an_extra/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory, this happened a few years ago and kinda a funny story to look back on now.

So I used to work in film and TV production. Just graduated college and finally got a shot to work as a production assistant on Spiderman: Homecoming. My first union run set.

Didn’t, and still do t care about MCU movies, nor did I really follow who was acting in them at all. At this time, during shooting Tom Holland was pretty new to the role and the only thing I think he was in that people heard about was Civil War which I hadn’t seen.

My boss, told me that I had to watch the food spread for any extras coming in and direct them to a different food spread, as extras weren’t allowed to have the main spread. This may sound kind of rude to do but this is pretty typical if you have a lot of extras because it would take too much time for everyone to get a plate and eat so they divide it up.

Anyway, it was right before break and my boss told me as I was waiting for the cast and crew to arrive I can get my food and wait around. So I did. While getting food I noticed a black cadillac pulling up (should have been my first clue) and a few people getting out, Tom being one of them. Again, still didn’t know who he was so I just thought he was maybe an extra. 

Tom is a super nice kid, came right up to me in line and started talking to me asking me how I was doing and all that. As we were making small talk I interrupted him and said “I don’t mean to interrupt, buy you by chance wouldn’t happen to be an extra are you?”. His face looked really confused and I looks like he thought I was joking, all he said was, “No, I play spiderman?”

My stomach dropped, all I could think of in my head was my first big set and i mistaken the lead actor for an extra. I apologized to him and told him that I didn’t know who was playing spiderman at all nor did I ever watch the movies before. He laughed and said it was okay. Bs’ed with him for a couple minutes after until he had to go back to his trailer. I was happy that he took it as well as he did, was really cool to meet him too, but was so incredibly embarrassing.

TL;DR
I had to make sure no extras went to the food table on Spiderman: Homecoming, with no prior knowledge of who was playing Spiderman. Tom got food next to me and asked him if he was an extra.

EDIT:
I should of put this in the post originally but didn’t think it was relevant at all, but i’m seeing people comment the same thing. On big sets like this, typically what happens is that production changes the name of the film, in this case the film was called Summer of George, this is for anonymity among outsiders so we don’t attract a crowd. This goes for the same thing with the casts names in the call sheet, it’s usually abbreviated. When I got the call sheet the night before all I had gotten was where, what time PAs were supposed to be. Didn’t even know it was a MCU movie until I signed my contract."
m4ryho,TIFU (Update) by not realizing the cute gym employee thinks I'm a trans woman.,36169,0.89,1004,2021-03-14 14:48:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m4ryho/tifu_update_by_not_realizing_the_cute_gym/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m4ryho/tifu_update_by_not_realizing_the_cute_gym/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"UPDATE - You can read my original post [here](https://redd.it/m1jy2b).

Hello, I'm back. Thank you for all your comments and awards. I never thought my post would get that much attention. I am glad a lot of you were able to get a good laugh out of it and I'm grateful for those who asked for an update because it helped pushed me to come clean to her. I felt it is my responsibility in the end to man up instead of chickening out and switching gyms or trying to play it off as a misunderstanding.

Before I begin, here are some things you guys wanted to know:

1. I only used the women's room once. After the first day, I waited until I got home.

2.  I introduced myself as Chris. I know that doesn't really help.

3. Some of you wanted to know how I look and I am honestly too embarrassed to post a picture for everyone to see when I am at my lowest. Instead, I give you [this](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4497202/mediaviewer/rm2107681280/) picture of Jimmy O. Yang. My hair is the same length as his in the photo and if I lost my COVID 19 weight he would be my closest celeb lookalike.

Alright anyways, it's been a couple days and while I had the intention of coming clean to her every time I went to the gym, more and more people were returning to work out and so I didn't feel comfortable coming clean to her with so many people around. It wasn't until Saturday that there were less people around. We were chatting as usual and at one point I bit the bullet and told her how I knew she thought I was a trans woman but that I couldn't bear to correct her. I also offered to switch gyms if she felt it was too awkward. She took it surprisingly well. She told me one of her ex who she is still friends with recently came out as a trans woman and that's why she was trying hard to be open minded and inclusive. We ended up talking about how we both still have a lot to learn about the trans community (like how I should have used trans woman with a space in my previous post). So yeah...I'm not sure how to end this but the situation has been resolved.

Special shout-out to all the people who commented/messaged me about the correct way to spell trans woman, the guy who wanted to CashApp me funds to go to a new gym and lastly to the person who said I should post on r/bustyasians

TLDR; Told the cute gym employee I am not a trans woman and we [may or may not have a date lined up.](https://imgur.com/nMSSTrz) 😏"
10s0pfe,TIFU: Inviting a girl over,36163,0.91,316,2023-02-03 02:29:31,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10s0pfe/tifu_inviting_a_girl_over/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10s0pfe/tifu_inviting_a_girl_over/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,True,False,False,"This happened this morning.   


This TIFU started on Saturday (it's Thursday now)   


Matched with a girl on Facebook Dating and she was very cute. I did notice that she only smiled with her top row of teeth in the pictures and figured that her bottom teeth might be effed up, but didn't think much of it. She had trad wife energy and I was into it.   


We end up meeting on Sunday after some pretty clean chatting. Turns out she lives exactly 8 mins from me so I offer to pick her up for our first date. I learn a LOT about her in a very short time - I won't reveal all the details, but she had battled a long time with eating disorders - thus her teeth a bit janky. From what I saw they weren't that bad.   


This is all a red herring - nothing about this TIFU has to do with the teeth. I wanted to mention it because I was so focused on this that I didn't pick up the other red flags.   


I also find out that she doesn't drink all that often and only at meal times if it's appropriate - how nice. She also lives with her parents - why? She has a surgery coming up and it's involving a lot of physical therapy - I piece together it's probably due to her aforementioned eat disorders and a complication thereof.   


Otherwise, great date.   


Fast forward to last night/this morning.   


I invite her over for dinner. The plan was her dad would drop her off because she doesn't have her car due to a recent wreck and I would drive her home later that evening. Okay.   
She also tells me that she is a felon like 1 hour before we hang out. Okay...   
Don't worry, it's just 3 DUIs and it's over with. Thanks for telling me? \[No, really, I should've paid attention to this red flag\]   


She comes over and after pleasantries I start to cook a shrimp curry soup. She asks for a drink - I show her my drink cabinet and picks out the most expensive tequila I have - that's fine. She proceeds to have 2 shots.   


Biggest fuck up: I presume that EVERYONE is good at self regulation of their drinking. It's just what I believe - we know if we are getting toasted or not and it's intentional.   


I join and catch up with 2 shots. I get a seltzer for myself and she grabs a cocktail. And another one. 4 drinks in 40 minutes for this 110 lb person. I assume she's good at holding her liquor.   


After dinner we are cuddling where she has her head in my lap. Suddenly! To my surprise she takes her pants off and says ""let's go to bed - a woman has needs.""   


Gentle reader - let me mention nothing sexual happened here. I was barely registering as tipsy and she was beyond drunk. 

I set her in bed and she immediately passes out. No worries. I'll put a trashcan near her and I'll go watch some tv/plays games and check on her.   


The horror story starts here:   
I check on her and I realize that my bed is dark. I touch it: it's pee.   
Just fucking great.   
I attempt to rouse her and alert her she has soiled herself (and my bed). She wakes up and asks me why I'm waking her up and then tries to flirt with me. I then notice she's soiling herself. Again. Actively. .While trying to seduce me.   


I somehow manage to get her to the bathroom and sit her on a toilet and have her drink water to sober up - this was a bad plan later.   


She refuses to use the toilet and I ease her down to the ground on my fuzzy bath mat. I drape her with a towel and place another beneath her - just in case.   


I then spend the next 5 hours until 4:30 AM washing my clothes, her clothes, my bedding, and comforter. At some point I sit on the couch where she was earlier and realized that she had soiled my couch. That's why she was so urgent to go to bed. FML.   


(I do check on her to make sure she's okay and I end up changing her towel twice)  


I finally decide to go to sleep at around 5 and I have work at 9, despite the ice storm. I set an alarm at 8 so I can drive her the hell home and forget it all happened.   


At 6:30 she wakes up, confused and naked, to which I provide her some of my gym clothes that I don't really care about. I go back to the couch and she is embarrassed and hungry. Fine. Go eat leftovers, but let me sleep. She clangs around the kitchen awhile. She apparently ate all the shrimp in the soup. Great.   
She decides to cuddle with me on the couch and I had no energy to push her away. She attempts to kiss me, but I rebuke it - and then realize there's gin on her breath.   


I spring up and go to the kitchen and realize SHE DRANK ANOTHER 4 OZ of GIN. At 7:30 AM!   


I run back to the bed and she's catatonic again.   
I start to freak out and see her phone - she told me her birthday on the first date and used that to open her phone - voila. Turns out she missed like 9 calls from her parents, so I call them from her phone.   
I explain every single detail of the happenings of the night and they are mortified.   
I tell them I have work and they need to come get her now.   
An hour later her father shows up - which is ridiculous because they live so close, but I was just happy he was there. 

I had gathered her laundry, belongings, etc and give it to Dad. Dad is not happy. He yells at her and I tell him, ""Hey, sorry, my house - please no yelling."" He apologizes and agrees (surprised that actually worked, but I guess he was embarrassed about everything?) Dad takes the stuff and comes back and says, ""She was almost 1 week sober. And this happens. Not your fault, son.""   
Oh.   
The DUI thing makes sense now.   
She CANNOT stand up by herself, so he tries to scoop her up from the couch, but she's completely dead weight and wakes up, yelling that she hates her dad  
AND   
PEES  
ON  
HIM  


And my couch. Again.   


We both end up dragging her to the car and my neighbors are watching, mortified of what seems like a kidnapping happening.   


Her mom just texted me to apologize a few hours later and that she would get me my clothes back.   

Edit: I'm most upset that in sitting here eating my shrimp-less soup

TL;DR: I ignore red flags on a cute a date and she ends up pissing on everything in my house and her father."
gob6q6,TIFU by cumming in my pants while my mom showed me a picture of Jesus,36157,0.76,1489,2020-05-22 08:24:55,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gob6q6/tifu_by_cumming_in_my_pants_while_my_mom_showed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gob6q6/tifu_by_cumming_in_my_pants_while_my_mom_showed/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,,False,"TIFU by cumming in my pants while my mom showed me a picture of Jesus.

&#x200B;

I'm a ""man"" of 21 living with my relatively conservative and religious parents while I go to college. My parent's house is a one story, cheaply built house. This means that the walls are PAPER thin, you can pretty much hear any normal volume conversation from anywhere in the house with pretty great clarity.

&#x200B;

In my case, doing the business isn't a loud activity so I don't have to worry about timing my strokes with the whir of the AC unit to mask the sound. I more have to worry about the activity level of those around me; as it is frequent where my parents will come to my room to talk or ask me to do tasks.

&#x200B;

With that being said. I have been caught off guard quite a lot and I have my lock down protocol in place to lower suspicion and avoid getting caught. One of the tactics of this 'lock down protocol' includes the time it takes me to answer a knock on my door. This consequently, is also the fatal flaw that now has me recounting the traumatic events of today. I figure that the quicker that I answer a knock with 'come in' the less suspicion I draw. I personally feel that if I were to yell 'hold on' and take like 10 seconds to hide the evidence, I would be raising the level of suspicion.

&#x200B;

Now, some may think that the tactic of answering as quick as possible is dumb. However, I have a little hallway inside of my room which is about 3 feet from the entrance of my door to my bed cutting off line of sight to anyone who even fully steps into my room. For the most part, my family never fully walks into my room past the hallway because they know that sound travels and that they don't have to make eye contact with me to get whatever they have to say across. However, tonight, my mom, who has gotten into painting during the quarantine, had a new piece of art to show me.

&#x200B;

So it's about 7pm and I can hear that my parents are in the living room down the hall watching their favorite TV shows, which they do for an hour or so every night after dinner. So I figure that now is as good a time as any to 'get busy' since I wouldn't be interrupted.

&#x200B;

I was wrong. No one was watching the TV, and my mom was in her office right next to my room scribbling away at our messiah.

&#x200B;

The folly of my judgement became clear as day when I heard a knock at the door just as I had past the point of no return. I scrambled to hide the evidence as the words 'come in' left my mouth. As I pulled my pants up, my mom turned the corner with a freshly painted picture of Jesus fucking Christ holding the hand of a little girl whilst they strolled down a dirt path in a meadow. I stood there looking into the eyes of Jesus while my mistake soaked my inner leg and sock.

&#x200B;

But at that moment I realized that this was only the beginning of my problems. I began to wonder why, in such a dark room, I was able to see the face of our lord and savior so clearly. It was then that I realized that in my rush to save what pride I had left, I had pulled my phone by my earbuds on to the floor, showing in glorious 1080p HD what could only be described of as SIN. I rush to put my soaked foot over the screen to possibly save myself from the eyes of the lord.

&#x200B;

With the lack of reaction from my mom, I figured that she hadn't seen what was on my phone, only fixated on my reaction to her new creation.

&#x200B;

I try to pick up my phone, mashing buttons on the sides hoping to find the power button to turn it off. Unfortunately, at the same time, I was trying to disconnect my earbuds to put my phone into my pocket as quick as possible. The combination of both frantic actions lead to the high decibel release of pain and pleasure that filled the room and serenaded the ears of my poor mother with the sounds of some woman being ass-blasted by a well endowed gentleman. My mom exits the room with not another word spoken.

&#x200B;

It has been 2 hours and the house has fallen silent. I fear that my time in this house has come to an end. I will live the rest of my life wandering the streets, homeless, hoping one day to repent for my sins.

&#x200B;

TL;DR : I was masturbating and about to cum when a knock at the door from my mom had me rushing to be presentable. I came in my pants while looking at a picture of Jesus that she had painted while porn blared from my speakers, causing an awkward moment in the universe.

Generalized update and edit:

It's the next day. I've crossed paths with my mom a few times and shes been kind of quiet. She doesn't seem too cross, so I'm gonna stay under the radar and ride it out the best I can. My parents have really mellowed with age and I feel that this may have been just more awkward than ""wrong"" and time will probably alleviate the tension

I've read through some of the comments and I would like to thank you guys for the humorous and light-hearted responses. Really helps take some of the anxiety out of the situation.

&#x200B;

I would like to address some other types of questions to give a better understanding of my situation

&#x200B;

\- I don't have a lock to my door. And I couldn't get one.

My parent's theory on door locks is ""If you're doing something that requires a locked door, then you probably shouldn't be doing it""

\- Yes I know I should have done it in the bathroom. And yes, I should have done it when no one was awake

However, as the title suggests ""Today I Fucked UP"" I fucked up everything for this situation. From my conditioning to respond to door knocks the way I do, to my inability for self control sometimes.

\-The Phone

I know that video players across all modern phones pause the video when an audio device is connected or disconnected. However, on the website that I was using (xfantasy), touching anywhere on the screen plays and pauses the video. In my anxiety riddled, fat fingered attempt to hide the phone, a brush against the screen was bound to happen.

\-It's fake

Everything is fake. Nothing could ever be real. You're just living in a simulation that is tailor made to anger you by filling Reddit with ""creative writing"" papers. What horrors it must be that you alone have to endure such torture, to be exposed to such inhumanities. Thank you so much for being the one to decipher the falsities of our universe.

Bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. So our sex life has stayed at our normal level. Probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

I've been having horrible nausea and headaches. I already have anxiety so I figured I'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

This morning I woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. I Google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. Symptoms include nausea and headaches. And the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

I've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

You're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. Now that I know this it seems SUPER OBVIOUS. But uh, guess I was too horny to think it through.

TL;DR did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

ETA: Thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

To answer as many questions as I can and also because I feel mildly defensive: He is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. There is no cure but no timeline either. We probably have a few more years. He is in EXCELLENT care at a renowned university program. We adore his team. I've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. This was not reviewed with us, only side effects. The separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. We didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. But it is mine. So all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. We're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. Or they just forgot. Or they figured we'd read the info. Shit happens.

3im341,TIFU by throwing my steak out a window,36147,0.96,1716,2015-08-27 21:40:08,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/,self.tifu,0,33,,text,False,False,False,"Last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. 

I scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. 

My wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

Now,  I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. 

Claim vegan-ism? No, I'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.

I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

Here's the big time FU.  The window wasn't open.  It was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

My wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. 

My wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

I just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was ""I... I'm so sorry. I am such a clutz... I don't know... I was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up... I can't believe this... I am so sorry"" etc... etc...

Both women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story.

I knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

I remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. My wife's only two words to me since the incident are ""I'm fine"". 

TL;DR:  Tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.

Edit: Thanks kind redditors (:

Update: Just got the first post-""I'm fine"" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

""good news, [boss' name] and i just had a good laugh over how much of a fucking idiot u are. i hope u know u will never live this down. love u you moron"""

My partner is a farmer and we get up at 4am every morning. We also live in an old wood house up a mountain.

Ok so this happened this me this morning. 

We woke up as usual and I went to put on the coffee machine, which we set up the night before because 4am is a ridiculous time to try and do anything

While the coffee was brewing I absent mindedly began to clear the sink from the night before. We are pretty lazy at night so all the dishes etc just get soaked.

So in my 4am haze I'm fishing about in the sink trying to clear out the rice from yesterdays meal so the water will go down. I grab what I assume to be a tea bag and go to put it in the bin. But of course, before I can do that I have to squeeze the liquid out as i dont want shitty water in the bottom of the bin.


Here's the fuck up incase you didnt see it coming. The 'teabag' is a dead mouse that has drowned overnight and become waterlogged and swollen. I squeeze the mouse and it explodes, covering my face with it's awful pink water/viscera.

No idea why my mouth was open at the time apart from it was 4am and I was probably mouth breathing and half asleep still.

It tastes like pennies and sadness. I may never be the same again.

TL;DR I exploded a mouse thinking it was a teabag and drank its divine juices, which I assume shot out of its waterlogged anus.

EDIT: thanks to everyone contacting me to tell me to seek medical advice. I have and have a follow up appointment next week. I'm glad my fuck up could turn so many stomachs"

As I sat up and reached for the light, it stung my other leg, then moved up to my thigh and stung again.  Lights on now, I reached down and began swatting at it and attempting to swipe it away from my with my hand.  Each time I tried to find the culprit, it would viciously sting my hand.  I discovered that it was hard and at least a couple of inches long- I was thinking scorpion or one of those giant man eating bees invading the northwest.  Three stings on the hand and I had located it- it was under the sheet.  Two more stings as I attempted to kill it while it was still trapped.  Finally and reluctantly, I pulled back the sheet, ready to deal with whatever monstrosity escaped.  It was a damned sewing needle, sticking halfway out of the mattress- and I’d been repeatedly stabbing myself with it.

TLDR; Mistook a sewing needle in my mattress for a stinging insect.  Repeatedly stabbed myself trying to swat it away with my hand."

So I have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we’ve only been together three months. And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

Ragebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I’d take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

I fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn’t care and...

I broke my back.

And then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

Woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

TL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face.

EDIT - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so I’m not paralyzed and there shouldn’t be any life-ruining effects. I’m just on bed rest and LOTS of pain medication!

Thanks for the silver! And gold! AND THE POO! And all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

I (29M) work in digital marketing. Company held party to celebrate the completion of big project. As I was walking to my car, I noticed a drunk female coworker (mid 30s). We worked together for 3 years, but it's a big department and I don't know much about her. 

She was having difficulty walking. I offered to help and she held out her hand. I asked if she drove here. She took an Uber. Helped her call another one as she vomited. Uber driver arrived, saw the condition she was in, and took off without saying a word. Understandable. 
 
I decided to drive her home. I have a duel front and rear dashcam setup. I moved the rear camera, placed it in front, and adjusted angle to make sure inside of vehicle is covered (lifesaver). 

Fast forward one month to April 25 (last week) and I was called into HR. My manager was sitting with a serious expression. They asked what I did after the party. I immediately became defensive and asked what the meeting is about. 

HR person said that they received a complaint from an employee accusing me of inappropriate behavior. I responded, ""I have no idea what you are talking about. I did nothing inappropriate during or after that party. Whoever complained has the wrong guy!""

They stepped out into the hallway for a couple minutes. I'm starting to sweat even though I did nothing wrong. Thinking, I remember giving coworker a ride home. That must be it. They step back into the office, manager says they have a witness who saw me put drunk coworker into my car. 

I said, ""Yea, I drove her home. Nothing happened...and I did not 'put' her in. She accepted the help."" Silence. They stare at me like I'm guilty. Nothing but suspicion and judgement. HR says they'll continue investigating and will speak to me the following week.

I received an email today, telling me to make a statement for the police and that I'm suspended until the case is dismissed. I'm pissed. Really pissed.

I hired an attorney and submitted statement to police. After asking around, I learned the coworker I gave a ride to is apparently the ex-wife of my manager's golfing buddy. Yea. 

Little does the company know I protected myself with dashcam footage as well as a short cell phone video of me walking her to the house. I am innocent and will fight this.

TL;DR - I drove drunk coworker home. Accused of inappropriate behavior one month later. Suspended by my company while they investigate. I hired attorney and have video footage proving my innocence."

So, what do I do go to a bar. There i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.


Fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. We went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. I dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if I won he would get Graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those Graham cracker Christmas houses, yes it was Spring, yes we were wasted.


So the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. The liquor probably helped a lot but I thought it was hot as fuck. He starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and I close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. Not a second later I hear a girl screeching. It scares the shot out of me so I scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. The guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and I'm still laying down and I cant see shit. She runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


I dont really know what I was supposed to do so I just kind of took a shower and left. Their shower was really nice though. It was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.


Overall
Guys looks: 8/10 Nice beard

Sex: 9.4/10 Nice and steamy 

Cum in eye: ß Gritty?

Shower: 10/10 Really cool


TL;DR: Got drunk, lost a bet, got titfucked, got cum in eye, fucked a relationship but showered in a really cool shower.


Edit: So... I was piss drunk when I made this post and simply put I would much rather have not posted this story at all. However as people seem to be deeply intrigued in it I will leave it up. I apologize for the parts of the story that seems to be just rambling as I had quite a bit to drink last night. Also, to those that gave me the awards I greatly appreciate it."

I'm one of those losers who loves Snapchat streaks. I collect them diligently and keep them going with morning and night streaks every day. At this point I have streaks with about twenty five people, some of them reaching almost 500 days.

I say all that to set up the fact that I'm affecting several people that I've been doing this with for a long time. Today I was brewing coffee in my giant metal percolator. It's very shiny and... reflective.

I sometimes sleep in the nude and last night was no exception. This morning I was waiting until I had to get ready for work before I got dressed, so I was still very naked when I decided to send my daily morning streak. Today I decided to take a picture of my brewing coffee as the picture (I'm not very creative). I did so, added a couple of ""good morning"" graphics, and sent it without a second thought.

Then one of my friends took a screenshot of my streak, prompting confusion. He sent it back to me and asked ""Uh... did you mean to have your dick in the pic?""

Sure enough, in the picture, my dick is CLEARLY visible in the reflective surface of the percolator. I just sent this to 25 people and so far only a couple of them have opened it, but I now live in dread of what this day brings.

TL;DR sent a reflective dick pic to 25 people via snapchat streaks and a coffee percolator

&#x200B;

**UPDATE** since everyone keeps asking. Fortunately for me but disappointingly for many of you, no one seemed to notice except my friend who told me about it in the first place. At least, no one said anything to me about it so far. Lesson learned!

&#x200B;

Double edit! For those who are wondering what a streak is, it's simply when you send a snap to someone and get one in return once every 24 hours. After three days, you get a little number next to their name showing how many days in a row you've snapped.

For those who are insulting me for being a grown man who uses snapchat, I'm sorry that my usage of a social media app that takes perhaps one full minute out of my day is so annoying to you. Let people enjoy things!

For those reminding me that there's no way 25 people care about what I do in the morning, *I know that*. You think I care about whatever bullshit they send me back? We do it to see the little number go up and get that quick dopamine rush, not because we give a shit about what coffee we're drinking!

Finally, god damn you thirsty bitches, [here's the picture](https://imgur.com/a/qFOWhbP). It's not super noticeable unless you know it's there.

**Final edit:** No, I will not be starting an OnlyFans. Please stop DMing me about it xD"

He likes to follow us around the house and is generally near me.

I also happen to have IBS, which has been aggravated by the stress of having a new puppy, and has apparently decided to manifest itself by me farting loudly and incessantly.

Since these farts are rather embarrassing, I’ve taken to jokingly blaming them on my puppy. Whenever I fart in front of my family and he’s around (which is most of the time), I would loudly say his name in a scandalized voice. This would usually result in him walking over to me, so of course when my adorable puppy comes over, I would pet him and kiss him.

Yesterday, I was home alone with him and he was on the other side of the room. I let out a roaring fart, but since I was alone, I didn’t say his name to “blame” it on him. However, as soon as he heard it, he still walked right over to me and sat down, tail wagging, waiting to be pet, which is when I realized I accidentally trained my dog to associate my farts with coming over to me and getting pet. 

TL;DR I accidentally trained my puppy to come when I fart.

The whole unit (and the neighboring floor) has been turned into negative airflow rooms to keep airborne COVID-19 particles from infecting the rest of the hospital. This isnt a big issue for the semi-sick covid patients, since they are generally droplet and contact precautions. But in the ICU, most of these patients are ventilated and constantly aeresolizing this virus.

Anyways, I'm lucky enough to have a PAPR, which is a hood that goes over your head and shoulders that's hooked up to a machine around your waist by a tube. This machine blows air into the hood, making it so any aerosolized material in the air is pushed away from my face. It's not a closed system like a scuba tank or anything though; all the air that's blown at your face is sucked in through this belt machine, which is filtering it constantly through a 3M filter.

Anyways, I'm all geared up and working in a patients room when I have to pass some gas. The patients intubated and sedated, I'm wearing a hood, no one else is around- what's the harm?

I let a silent but deadly rip... right under this PAPR machines intake. Now, no particulate is getting through this thing, but gas sure does. I spent the next 5 minutes trying not to wretch as this hood circulates my toxic ass scent through my hood.

Note to self, wear the papr on the front next time.

My sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until I realized what the first thing I do in the morning...

She said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. After a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

My girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so I thought. I called her the following night cause I felt extremely guilty. She said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. She simply asked that I never do it again. 

Come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. I absolutely love her so much but I let lust get between us. 

I really fucked up guys..

TL;DR: I fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends."

This happened 30 minutes ago and is exactly what I get for going out during COVID.

I would also like to add that I'm still tipsy from the marg, so sorry for any errors...

So today is my birthday and has been incredibly uneventful. I took the day off of work, but despite that it's just been a normal day. No friend group gatherings, no gifts, just another day (and I'm totally fine with that). My mom on the other hand felt bad that there was no celebration of any kind, so she was insistent that we go to my favorite restaurant (a local Mexican restaurant). I agreed to go for a very early dinner.

We get there and are having a good time and it was nice to pretend the world was normal for a moment. I ordered a margarita, they ID'd me and figured out it was my birthday. Fast forward to the end of the dinner and I thought I was in the clear from a birthday celebration from the staff. As they bring the bill, they put a big sombrero on my head and started clapping and singing and set down a dessert in front of me. One of the guys had whipped cream on his finger and went in to put it on my nose, drunk me didn't comprehend that and was very confused. Due to the big sombrero covering my face, he was kind of stumbling trying to find my nose, I thought ""oh I know what I'm supposed to do!"" and my dumbass self sucked the whipped cream off his finger.

I realized immediately after that, no 'Dundermifflinhoe, that is not how you interact with strangers' but it was too late. They picked up the pace of their singing and the guy ran away right after and hid in the kitchen. The whole restaurant (which granted was like 10 other people, but still) stared at me and my mom couldn't stop laughing.

We got put the dessert in our to-go box and left. 23 years is off to a great start.

TL;DR - My waiter was trying to put whipped cream on my nose to celebrate my birthday, drunk me was confused and sucked his finger instead

EDIT: getting a lot of hate for going out during COVID. I agree with everyone saying that it was a stupid decision to go out to eat. It was. I know I’m the asshole. Thank you for all the lovely reminders in my inbox. I wanted a break from the stresses of life and went about it the wrong way. I take full responsibility.

EDIT PART 2: Guys, thank you so much for all the kind words. I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me. My inbox is flooded with messages and I can’t respond to everyone but just know that the positive responses really turned my day around."

It was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
So i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where the FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  
The next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction

It's a **long** one so buckle up.

Me: $D

Friend/Co-Conspirator: $F

&#x200B;

This story starts with me, a 'quiet but well liked throughout the school' 17 year old in IT class at my High School in a large suburban, two city public school district. We had one of the best high school IT programs in the country at the time for many reasons. Part of our class (of about 35) involved us going around the school to do basic maintenance on school computers. Although with the exception of myself and $F, our class never touched staff computers.

Myself and $F were the two students always finishing our two week classwork cycle in about two days. So we were always tasked by our IT Teacher with helping the school IT guy (district employee stationed at the school in the IT lab) to go around and fix issues throughout the building while everyone else worked on their classwork. Often, we were loaned the IT guy's keys and district keycard to go around the school and take care of business. (This is important later) Over time, myself and $F became well known by staff around the school for being able to fix ""anything"" so we eventually gained a lot of trust from our IT Teacher and District IT guy. To the point that we knew passwords we **ABOSOUTELY** should not have known.

We knew everything from the password to the surveillance system to the master (domain admin) password district IT used to access everything from HR files to grades to mechanical systems. This password literally let us access anything on any computer in the entire district. And before you ask, yes all buildings in the district (including admin) were linked together and no they weren't firewalled off from each other. Now we never used our powers maliciously as we loved our school and never would've done anything to harm anyone or damage any systems.

One day I thought to myself ""wow, Information Security (InfoSec) in this district is **atrocious**, I wonder how easy it would be to test it from a student perspective, then present my findings to the district IT guy"". This, would be the beginning of the biggest fuck up of my life.

(I'll try to keep the technical stuff to a minimum)

My mission started one day when I was tasked to grab a computer from a classroom and bring it to the lab. Easy enough. I was given IT guy's 35+ keys and sent off. While walking to the room, I dropped the ring, it took me a minute to find the right key on the ring. When I found it, since I was looking  bit harder than usual at each key, I noticed something peculiar about the key he used to open doors inside the school. It was stamped DGM and looked different than the usual \*M stamp master key for this one high school building. Not seeing this abbreviation before, I thought, ""ok this must be an important key since it works like a school master but looks different"".

I opened the (empty) classroom, fired up a locksmithing app on my phone and took a digital impression of the key that gave me the bitting code so I could duplicate it later on, grabbed the computer, went back to the lab and gave the keys back. Curious about what this DGM stamp meant, I started googling on my phone, ""DGM \[Key Manufacturer\]"". It came up with GM as ""Grand Master"", the key above the master key. Nothing with DGM came up in the search.  I thought ""ok this is just the ""grand master"" key that opens all three buildings on the school property, NBD. (Main School, Theater, and Aux Gym buildings)

""Ok. but what does that D in DGM stand for? Nothing in the school district starts with a D, except... **District**. Holy shit, it must mean ""District Grand Master. But they can't be stupid enough to make one key that opens doors in all 15 schools. Right?""

I get home and order a key duplicate on the website that built that locksmithing app. A week later it shows up and I bring it to school. Before gym class I tried it on one of the doors in the Aux gym and low and behold, it worked. Great! Part one of my test plan is complete. Someone with this key could cause a lot of damage if they wanted to, but how would they get past the alarm systems in each building? Because it would be difficult to discreetly do a lot of damage if the building was full of people. Naturally someone with ill intensions would carry out their act at night while the building alarms are armed.

I already knew that the alarm systems were controlled by keycards that every staff member in the district had. (It was an antiquated system with flaws known to the IT world) Their cards only worked for the buildings they worked in. So the cards, electric doors, and alarms must be controlled at the school level, not at the district admin office. Right?

So how was I going to get a hold of a keycard long enough to scan and duplicate it onto a new card? It required a laptop and a special piece of equipment that I couldn't just bring to school while everyone was there. I thought ""I can't access the security system and lookup badge codes with the IT master password I know, that defeats the whole purpose of this test. Where's the next vulnerability in this system?"" Then I realized, there's a gate to the staff parking lot that's opened with keycards, but not their district cards, they had separate cards for the gate. I scanned the entire network for this gate controller, but couldn't find it anywhere. ""Good Job school district, leaving your gate system closed circuit. It's inconvenient to program, but definitely more secure.""

Okay, so where is this gate controller located? I've got a district master key so when I find it, I can access it locally. I look at the gate itself and see a freshly paved line in the concrete leading from the gate motor to the Aux Gym. ""Okay, its somewhere in the Aux Gym.""

I wait until Saturday during Football practice, the Aux Gym is disarmed and the front door is open. Everyone's out on the field so no one will see me enter the building. ""Hey there's a closet by the front door I'll try this one first."" There it fucking is. The gate controller is mounted on the wall. I open up the panel and attach my laptop. ""Fuck there's a password, what could it be? It's not going to be the master password, this isn't connected to the network."" I look at the circuit board, there's a label with ""admin - (name of city school is located in)"". Unbelievable, that's the login. ""District IT People are paid six-figures to make this shit up? Seriously?""

I accessed the swipe log and I noticed an interesting trend. Half the time someone swipes into the parking lot, there's an access denial that immediately precedes a valid gate card swipe. ""They must be swiping their district cards first instead of the gate card!"" Lucky for me, this system records badge numbers when access is denied. So I had access to several district keycard codes, protected by a password that is the name of our city. Wonderful. I sift through the logs and notice the names of three district janitors, all three with the preceding access denied messages and codes, followed by their valid gate cards. I remembered these people from my previous schools, so their district cards must open multiple buildings. (Remember when I mentioned that district buildings weren't firewalled off from each other on the network?)

I took one of the codes and encoded it onto a blank keycard with that special piece of equipment that cost me $20 on eBay, walked out the front door and scanned the card. I heard a loud click and the reader light turned green. Holy shit, I now have a DGM key and a keycard that disarms **EVERY** school alarm system in the district. Nothing is off limits to me. Part 2 complete.

I call up my friend $F who somewhat knew what I was doing, and once nighttime rolled around, we decided to visit almost every school in the district. Just to see if it actually worked. And boy it did. We easily swiped into each school, the alarm automatically disarmed, and the DGM key opened every door in every building we visited. I found myself thinking ""Good Lord, security here is even more atrocious than I thought"". We had the decency to rearm each building before we left and once we were done, we planned on telling the IT guy on monday when we went to class.

Well, my dumbass decided to try one more school the next day (Sunday Morning), I swiped in and within 10 seconds, the (middle school) principal walked through the door and asked ""Who are you?"" I could've bolted out the front door, but I wanted to be honest because they were gonna find out on monday anyways. So I told him who I was and what I was doing (very short version).

He took me to his office and had me sit down while he made a phone call. It was someone at the district office. All I heard him say was ""I can't distinguish this from my own badge, its a perfect copy but it has his name and photo on it"". He hangs up. Asks me more questions and it eventually leads to the DGM key. This especially panics him because he knew what it was but didn't know anyone other than the District Ops manager that had one. He makes another phone call, ""This is (principal name) at (middle school) I need someone to come down here now."" I'm thinking ""Okay, someone from the district will be here to ask more questions, cool.""

**Boy was I wrong**, within a few minutes about six police officers show up and start asking me questions. I'm honest, I tell them my plan and what I did. They all looked utterly confused by the end of my short explanation. They took the keycards and DGM key and asked me to call my parents to pick me up. They search my car and find pot in the trunk (oops). So there's a charge right there. They said they'll notify us later once they talk to the district and I was released into my dad's custody.

A few hours later, my mom gets a phone call from $VP saying I'm not to attend school monday and we will have a meeting that evening at the high school. ""Okay, understandable. I haven't been able to explain myself. They're playing it safe.""

**Whoops wrong again!**

&#x200B;

IT Teacher: $ITT

District IT Director: $ITLady

Vice Principal: $VP

Cops: $PD

We arrive at the school for the meeting, my IT teacher is sitting in the school office with a disappointed yet very proud look on his face. As we arrived we were called into the conference room, I expected it to be just $VP, lmao no. It was $VP, two cops, and some random district official. My IT teacher was there just to translate the technical terms. I explain my whole plan, being interrupted many times by everyone to ask their questions. At one point $VP says ""Jesus $ITT you're not supposed to be teaching this stuff!""

$ITT: $VP, Do you realize the amount of critical thinking and work that went into this project?""

Well, after he says this, there's a knock on the door. ""$VP, $ITLady is here""

""Random district official"" leaves and $ITLady enters and sits down in front of me""

$VP: $M this is $ITLady, the District Director of IT. She has some questions for you.

$M: Ok

She proceeds to tear into me, asking ""WHAT DID YOU BREAK, WHAT DID YOU HACK?!"" I could literally see the veins popping out of her head. She was **pissed the fuck off**.

She couldn't accept that a bored teenage kid that just wanted to see if this was possible, was able to compromise her systems in one week. At one point the officers asked her to leave the room and take a break because she was getting so worked up.

Fast forward to after the meeting, the police took myself, my mom, $VP, and $ITT to my house and seized all of my electronic equipment. Everything from my cell phone, to my laptop, to my WiFi adapter and everything in between. My favorite part was when they were searching my computer bag. The police officer opened it, rummaged around for a bit, taking everything electronic out, then gently and over dramatically pulling a strand of condom wrappers out in front of everybody.

$Mom: \*Glares at me\* Previously not knowing I was having sex at 17

$Mom's new BF: \*Leaves room immediately\*

$Cops: \*Looks at $VP not sure what to do\*

$ITT: \*Gently facepalms\*

$M: Thinking ""Fuck, this is bad""

$VP: \*staring at the cops for about five seconds\* ""Okay well let's move on""

They all leave after seizing basically everything I own.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a few days later, I get a letter from the district saying I have been suspended pending expulsion. Great.

We attend the expulsion hearing, I say exactly what I said in the first meeting with $VP and the cops.

Get another letter two days later, I'm expelled. We appeal to the school board and the district's lawyers. They don't want to hear any of it. Appeal denied. They're pressing full charges. Okay I didn't know what the charges were but they were pressing them. Cool, great.

&#x200B;

Two months later I meet with county Juvenile, I again explain to them my story, they're just as confused as the district people but my Juvenile rep is taken back by my calm demeanor and willingness to share all the details. By this point the district has done a through investigation and found no evidence that I stole or caused damage to property or their computer networks. They then Inform me I'm being charged with:

\-- 9 counts of Felony Burglary 2

\-- 3 counts of Class A Misdemeanor Computer Crime

\-- 3 Counts of Class A Identity Theft

\-- 1 Count of Poss. Controlled Substance on School Grounds

I'm also ordered not to use any electronic devices until I see the judge. This included something as simple as a TV remote.

***Fuck Me***

&#x200B;

I have a few more meetings with the County Juvenile rep, she was actually a very nice person and was surprised I was assigned to her in the first place because she usually got the murders and rapists. She got to know me and my true intensions with the entire plan over the next month.

Before my first hearing, she (the county) recommended to the school district not to press charges. They felt this could be remedied in-district, since while crimes were committed, I wasn't aware of the crimes and there was obviously no bad intent.

During the hearing, my Juvenile rep and shitty court appointed lawyer explained my side and the district lawyer explained theirs. The judge was extremely confused by the whole situation, saying ""we've never seen a case like this before, at this point I don't know how to proceed"" The DA also looked equally as confused.

Judge asked the district's lawyer: ""How do you want to proceed?""

Lawyer: We'll take this under further review

Judge: $M expect a call from your Juvenile rep this week. Adjourned.

&#x200B;

Three days later, we receive a call from Juvenile. The district is pursuing all charges and wants $80,000 in restitution for a new district security system. **Wonderful news.**

I live in a constant state of panic for the next three months while waiting for the next court date. I end up going to the district's alternate school for a while while attending twice weekly meetings at juvenile.

Went a few more times in front of the judge, my lawyer, Juvenile, and district lawyers doing all the talking, explaining the entire case to the judge. The district still insisting I stole and damaged district property even though I never did and they ever found any evidence.

About seven months into this, the Judge had enough. She didn't want to hear anything more and was going to issue my disposition (ruling) at the next hearing.

She explained that $80,000 in restitution was ludicrous and the district was going to pay for their own security upgrades if they chose to.

She then looked at me and asked me to rise.

Judge: ""I have three options here Mr. $M""

""Option 1, I dismiss all of the charges and we'll be done here

Option 2: I drop the marijuana charge, reduce all other Charges to Attempted (Misdemeanors), and sentence you to one year bench probation

Option 3: I send you to jail right now""

I almost lost it right there.

Judge: ""Based on what I've heard from our Juvenile rep and read in the police reports, I'd like to go with Option 1 and dismiss the charges. But because of the sheer severity of the crimes on paper, I am unable to do that. So I am going with Option 2. I hereby sentence you to one year of bench probation and order you to pay restitution in the amount of $3,200 for district staff overtime. Good luck Mr. $M.""

I don't remember what was said after that because I was so relieved I almost passed out.

&#x200B;

After three months of thinking I was going to prison for 20 years, it was all over. I was numb for the rest of the day.

All in all, The whole experience only left me with severe depression and anxiety for a few years but hey I'm not in prison. Great, right?

Actually it ended up better than I thought. I ended up graduating from the alternate school's accelerated graduation program shortly after that. (The district wanted me out of their hair ASAP)

I received a full diploma from my regular High School at the end of my junior year. I got to essentially skip most of my junior and all of my senior year of HS. Ended up working my ass off and got a great IT job at a company I still work for today. And now I have IT Director as my title.

And that is how I royally fucked up by shaming the fuck out of my school district

Shove it $ITLady!

&#x200B;

TL;DR I exploited security flaws in my school district's security system. They got royally pissed and tried to send me to prison. Instead the judge gave me a slap on the wrist and I graduated a year an a half early. Now have a great job in IT.

9ho3ez,TIFU by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.,35592,0.88,1542,2018-09-21 15:29:14,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9ho3ez/tifu_by_burning_700_lbs_of_marijuana_and_getting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9ho3ez/tifu_by_burning_700_lbs_of_marijuana_and_getting/,self.tifu,0,11,,text,False,False,False,"While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It’s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It’s a remarkable sight. 

For those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify… I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there’s another reason to steer clear.

Anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

A genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

“Well that’s a clever idea!” I thought, relieved that we wouldn’t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

Ah but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200B;

The early effects weren’t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: 

“Hey we need to…. We need to… do something… like… now?” I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

This was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

“Sergeant, I’m… I’m high as shit!” He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

“Someone, relieve him!” (genius)

Several individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

“Who the hell approved this!!?” The First Sergeant yelled

“I believe you did..” The CO responded 

“Well where’s the detail that brought it in?” 

“That would be us First-Sergeant” Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned… I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking “ohjesusohjesusohjesus I’m going to get caught...!” It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

I turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other’s laps, goofing off, and having a ‘deep philosophical conversation’ about a bug’s journey through life.

Inert.

I wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.

I assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

At this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

Although I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.

 

TL;DR – Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us."

First, though, a little back story.  My oldest child, my only daughter, was born in 1998.  She's healthy, smart, witty, beautiful, and all the things a proud dad could hope for.  At the time of this story, though, she was only about 3 years old.  

My second child, however, was not so lucky with the health issues.  At five weeks old, he had a near-miss SIDS incident that left him with massive brain damage and a host of other issues that stemmed from that.  At the point of this story, he was in the state's Early Intervention program, which meant that we as a family got extra assistance with a few things, my daughter got preferential treatment to get into early education programs and a few things like that.  For the events of this story, he was (as I recall) with my parents this day, but that's how we came to be at the particular event where this TIFU occurred.

These events happened sometime in early 2002.  The early intervention program was having a dinner/event for family members, and so my wife, daughter and I were all going to this event.  Due to life being life, my wife and daughter were heading to the event from home and I was heading directly there from work, meeting up with them there.

So, here we are, at an Early Intervention event sponsored by a state aid program, and the wife and I are chatting with director of this program, who is essentially a state empowered agent to look after the welfare of special needs children and their families.  We'll call her Jenn for the sake of this story, which is definitely not her real name.  My wife and I both like this state agent and were enjoying a conversation with her and my daughter was making the most of the event that did have other kids but was mostly for adults.

The conversation turned, however, when Jenn asks my daughter what's on her mind.  I swear, to my dying day I will never forget exactly how my daughter replied to her: ""**Mommy doesn't like it when Daddy beats us**.""

I was, I hope understandably, speechless.  I looked to my wife and she also had no clue where the hell that came from...  we looked to Jenn who was looking back and forth between us, because she'd been working with us for a while and didn't think me capable of beating either of them.  We turned back to my daughter to try to figure out what she was talking about.

It seems that since we arrived at the event separately, one of us had to get there first and that day it was me.  When my wife arrived she noticed my car already in the parking lot. Since we had joked about racing there, she said something to my daughter to the effect of ""Oh, darn, Daddy beat us.""  As in, I beat them to the event.  I arrived first.  But my daughter took the phrase ""I beat them"" to heart, and was happy to share it with Jenn when she asked how my daughter was.  After all, she was 3, why would she be worried about other meanings of the phrase?

Once we figured that out, we shared a relieved if somewhat awkward laugh. The rest of the event came and went uneventfully;  honestly, I don't remember much of it after that, as I was still recovering from the ""OMFG"" shock at what my daughter had said before we figured it out.  Considering that my daughter said that to a state employee I'm very glad she knew us well enough to take the time to figure out what happened with us, but, yeah.  I do still enjoy reminding my daughter every once in a while of how she did me wrong that day, but she usually rolls her eyes at me when I do.  

TL;DR:  My daughter told a state employee that I beat her and my wife to an event in a way that could have been easily misunderstood."
giq9zl,TIFU by drinking “flat soda” and accidentally probably poisoning myself.,35516,0.88,1801,2020-05-13 08:11:58,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/giq9zl/tifu_by_drinking_flat_soda_and_accidentally/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/giq9zl/tifu_by_drinking_flat_soda_and_accidentally/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"First, some background. My partner always leaves a little bit of Coke Zero in his can after drinking it. And this is totally gross, but I love the taste of flat soda. So whenever I clean up the empty cans, I’ll take the last swig of whatever is left over. Really disgusting. I get it. Nobody’s perfect. This is my flaw. 

ANYWHO. This morning I go to do this, as I always do. Come to find out, he had done a water test to test the ammonia, ph, nitrates etc in our aquarium’s salt water the night before. He had dumped the remnants of the test chemicals and salt water into his Coke Zero can, unbeknownst to me. 

I picked it up this morning and was like “oh man, score there’s a lot left in here” and geared up to slurp it down. Slurp slurp slurp. Yes, I’m a disgusting human. Get over it. 

Of course, upon initial contact with this horrific concoction, I had realized my grave error. I ended up spitting it out all over the living room and, not long after, my throat started to tingle. I mean, REALLY tingle. 

This is when panic set in. I was alone. My dogs just stared at me. 

This is how I die. What would the coroner think?

I ended up calling poison control to ask them if I was dying and had to tell them that I had accidentally consumed a mixture of aquarium water testing chemicals and salt water. This is harder to explain than one might think. Especially when you think you might be actively dying. 

At this point my throat is PULSATING and I can feel my pulse quickening. I know I am probably imagining these problems, but I can’t help it. 

After asking me several times, “Wait, you did what?” the kind man at poison control told me to gargle with vinegar, monitor my symptoms, and to not consume aquarium saltwater test chemicals ever again. 

No shit. 

TL;DR: TIFU by drinking what I thought was leftover flat soda. It was actually a mixture of flat soda, saltwater, and aquarium test chemicals. The fear of imminent death ensued. I’m fine, and poison control got a kick out of my story.

UPDATE:

Oh, wow. Thanks for the awards. My first gold, all because I’m a dumbass. 

May my story be a cautionary tale to you all. Don’t drink beverages that have been left open and unattended, and don’t revel in someone else’s backwashed flat soda. 

As for my boyfriend, yeah...he fucked up, too. At least we learned our lesson with minimal consequences. A fuck up all around. Be careful with chemicals. They ain’t playing around."
f5si3k,TIFU by grooming myself on a flight and shaving my beard only to trigger the crew's anti-terror training and make everyone super paranoid for a short while,35494,0.77,2495,2020-02-18 19:52:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f5si3k/tifu_by_grooming_myself_on_a_flight_and_shaving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f5si3k/tifu_by_grooming_myself_on_a_flight_and_shaving/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"This happened while ago while I was traveling to the US on a 9h flight from Europe.

*Context: I'm Greek / Lebanese and am a rather moderately hairy person, most of it on my face.*

I had an important meeting to attend in the US that was happening a few hours after I land, so I had to freshen up and prepare while on the plane still. A few hours into the flight, I went to the bathroom to change my clothes, wash my face and freshen up, shave and trim my beard, put on some deodorant etc. Took my backpack with me since I've got everything in there. 

After spending some 5 minutes in there, struggling to move around the tiny bathroom stalls on planes, someone knocks on the door. I brushed it off with something along the lines of “I’ll be right out”, I thought someone needs to use the bathroom but it was clearly occupied. Another 5 minutes go by and I start hearing chatter outside and could feel some people moving around. I hear a knock again, at this point i had my shirt off and my face was half shaven with mousse all over the other half. I open the door in this questionable state. To my surprise I see 3 flight attendants looking terrified standing around the door... Two women and one man. So I laugh and ask them if there is a rule and a timer for how long you can use the bathroom or what exactly was going on. The man proceeds to tell me some passengers complained because they saw me go in with my backpack, and i stayed in there a while, so they were scared something was going down and reported it to the flight crew. Mind you it wasn’t even at the ""questionable"" beard or stage or anything... it had grown for some two weeks or more give or take ~~just a week or more of fuzz~~ (*edited to say that definitely more than a week’s btw should have been clearer*). So I laugh some more and tell him I fully understand, but I had an important meeting upon landing hence freshening up, and that i’ll need a bit longer to just shave fully and finish grooming myself. He then excuses himself and we laugh a bit then he goes away. 

Shortly after he comes back knocking and I open, this time in a new fresh shirt and fully shaved, and i ask what’s up? He tells me that some passengers are still concerned i’m shaving my beard and thought I was shaving my body too since I opened the door with mousse dripping on my face and without my shirt on. I was very confused and at that stage started to get annoyed, just let me use the damn bathroom in peace there are many others people can use. **Turns out that apparently some extremist muslim groups do this before they ""get up to no good""** (aka sacrifice their life in an act of holy retribution/terror/whatever the fuck you want to call it). Something about going to heaven freshly clean... So at this point i’m laughing too hard but I tell him I fully understand and that this is a good thing they check on such instances. I’d rather be safe than sorry. I then show him my meeting email with the time and date for the sake of their peace of mind. I also mentioned I was Christian born but not religious and that even as a Lebanese dude I had no idea terrorists were shaving before acts of terror, thanks for the information I didn't really need. 

We then had a chat outside with the rest of the flight crew, laughing and making jokes. I could tell they were still a tiny bit paranoid but 95% apologetic. They didn't check my bag or anything and now that I think about it I should have shown them what was in the bag (snacks, iphone cables, some books, clothes and my toiletry bag).

**TL;DR - I groomed myself on a flight and the flight crew along with some passengers went full anti terror alert mode while fearing this was something more than just one beardy dude shaving and putting on fresh clothes.**

Edit: 

[Here's a photo of where my beard was at more or less before I shaved](https://i.imgur.com/mOFrIPP.jpg) 

[And here's a photo I took after I was done with the whole ordeal](https://i.imgur.com/noFtQ0o.png?1) (hoodie was swapped before meeting lol)

----

Edit 2: For the many ""why would you shave on the plane"" queries - it was a special circumstance trip that I booked on a day's notice and my beard grows too fast so shaving before we took off would mean I'd have some annoying stubble when we landed. I wanted to look as fresh as I could for that meeting and I did what I could with the given circumstances. I also groomed myself during a “lights off” time where everyone is asleep. Queues to bathrooms don’t form during that time. Remember, they **offer you shaving kits** on some business flights so to think anyone shaving on a plane is extreme is funny but understandable if you’re unaware. They have plugs for razors, hair dryers, etc in the plane bathroom stall. I mean they change poopy kids in there so think about that for a second Reddit.

I live in a small apartment building in the middle of the city. Even though living directly in the city, the area tends to be really quiet. 

I come home from work, eat whilst watching TV and slowly make myself hover to my beloved bed.
The urge of jerking off has been there all day, i just ignored it for today tho. Everything was quiet when i heard the first few things starting to bang against the other side of my wall. Thinking nothing of it i slowly drift off into sleep when suddenly, WHAM another strike hits. This time louder and more shaky.
I hear silent “moans” and loud “humping”. 
We just recently got new neighbors, a young couple mid 20s. 

As already mentioned, the urge to whack it was there all day, so i did what any man would do: i start jerking off to what i believe are sex sounds.

Time goes on and the noises are getting louder and louder.
Right as i finish i hear a loud *THOMB* like somebody just hit the floor.
In shook, heartrate at around 200bpm, i sit there.
I stare into the emptiness of my room.

Sitting there for what felt like years, was only 1 minute.
Slowly i get myself together and start cleaning up.
No new noise has since been heard.

Done with everything i lay in bed once again, this time ready for sleep.

That’s when i hear a loud *KNOCK KNOCK* from the other apartments door.

“Police, please open the door” 

The door opens, the policemen swarm into the building.
The woman screaming, as she is being brought to the outside.
I look out the window 

1 Cop and 1 Ambulance car.

My thoughts as slowly realize i just did the do to a woman getting beaten up.

I feel bad now.
I could’ve helped.

This shit gon give me PTSD for sure.


tldr:
what sounded like 2 people having sex, turned out to be a man beating up his woman. which i accidentally beat my meat to.

EDIT:

changed: “flick it” to “whack it”.

EDIT 2:

well lol this kinda blew up.
so thanks for the gold and these other awards.
still in shock tho

EDIT 3:

a lot of people think this is fake / a copy pasta / stolen.
sadly it’s not. 
also i don’t know why people say “free karma”, i created the throwaway account especially for this instance. i’m never gonna use it again.

others think i’m a freak, like yeah alright. 
and you’re flawless, aye?"
cntwx0,TIFU when using the shower head to masturbate,35399,0.87,1652,2019-08-09 04:59:45,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cntwx0/tifu_when_using_the_shower_head_to_masturbate/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cntwx0/tifu_when_using_the_shower_head_to_masturbate/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Alrighty it’s now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won’t stop laughing at me. 

Last night hubby & I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

As usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

As a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I’m no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

The night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I’m having a shower & he says he doesn’t care, he’s going to bed. 

I should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone’s concerned we drove under the influence). 

I’m washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... 

Ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

Ok feels better but I could still use more pressure.. 

Ohh ok that’s just right. Yeah that’s the spot... oh YEAH THAT’S THE SPOT!!!!! 

...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

Just as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

Hubby came running in and I’m telling you it was a fucking sight. 

I’m planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I’m crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

I fucked up y’all. 

It takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that’s ever happened. 

I managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.

Anyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. 

I told the nurse & doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

I’ll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

TL;DR went to town on myself with the shower head, as I orgasmed I slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ED for a few stitches.

Edit: changed the TLDR for u/Nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

Edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. Thanks for the awards too. 

To answer the biggest question: I was embarrassed and panicked when I said I was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying I slipped. Stupid I know, but none of us are perfect. 

To all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can’t so you’ve got that 😂

To the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think I’m a man, who slid into my DMs just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. I’m not responding to anyone who attacks me, it’s pretty sad you’ve got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it’s just not needed. 

I’ve also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and I’ve learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!"
ga4gbe,TIFU by accidentally telling my friends family he banged his cousin,35397,0.88,1841,2020-04-29 12:12:10,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ga4gbe/tifu_by_accidentally_telling_my_friends_family_he/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ga4gbe/tifu_by_accidentally_telling_my_friends_family_he/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,,False,"Mandatory: this happened last week but still

So, my friend and I have been close for a long time and he tells me all his secrets because he knows I would never (intentionally) tell his secrets to anyone. I am known in my friend group for being a steel trap for secrets because I don't care, and don't have a good enough memory to share with anyone what they tell me.

My friend, lets call him Hiram, confided in me a while ago that he went to hang out with a female cousin of his, lets call her Amelia. Well, Hiram and Amelia always had a weird relationship because Hiram always found Amelia very attractive, and he thought she would flirt with him sometimes. They ended up going to a movie together and ended up playing hide the cucumber in the back of his PT Cruiser. He tells me this in a dairy queen parking lot, and I nearly had aneurysm. So, I sat on the secret for like 2 years, and I was doing so good in the whole ""not sharing earth shattering secrets"" department.

Fast forward to last week. I was hanging out with Hiram, and some of his other cousins, all of whom are men who he has not had sex with (to my knowledge), and we were just playing video games and having a good time. At some point Amelia comes up in conversation between all of us. His male cousins snicker a little bit because apparently they knew he had a crush on her at some point, but I interpreted their snickers as them knowing that Hiram had boned Amelia. I wasn't too wrong for thinking this because these guys tell each other EVERYTHING. So, anyway I say ""dude I still cant believe you banged your cousin"" and one of his other cousins yells ""YOU WHAT"". I think at that moment I saw Hirams life force leave his body. Now, I have to live with the fact that I may have just destroyed an entire family with one sentence.

So, anyway I'm now going into witness protection because Hiram is going to fucking kill me, forward any of my mail to my new address in Argentina.

Adios muchachos

\- Anon

TL;DR- I unearthed my friends long kept secret of him boning his cousin in front of his other cousins, and now for the rest of their lives family reunions are going to be very very awkward.

A friendly Redditor [u/kevindavebob] suggested I post on TIFU so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). This is certainly a TIFU and it all just happened so I’m still feeling pretty terrible about it.

I have a rare disease called Usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. One of the ways I cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever I can to create visual memories before I go blind. I went to Iceland to try to see the northern lights. I can’t even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. I didn’t know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

I really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for Usher syndrome. Only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, I certainly can’t capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. I was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. The photo has been linked so many times that I didn’t spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

With my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, I posted in r/pics. I chatted with a few kind Redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about Usher syndrome. Then I went to sleep….

Well, all hell broke loose.

My post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. I woke up to THOUSANDS of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me I don’t have my disease, Redditors telling me they’re happy I’m going blind if it is true, that I should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones I won’t write here).

I wish the mods took my post down while I was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite Reddit telling me I was a fraud. It then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where I got even more hate. I didn’t say it was my picture, but I didn’t credit the photographer. I SERIOUSLY fucked up.

I can’t even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. Living with Usher syndrome is NOT easy. There is no cure and it’s terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. My vision especially. I want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for Usher syndrome to discover a cure. Not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

I was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, I didn’t make the effort to credit the photographer the way I should have. I fucked up Reddit. 

I am getting so much hate now, even outside of Reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. I’m sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for Usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. We have too much negativity in this world and it’s got to stop at some point. 

Thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized I made a mistake. Thank you Luke Stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. I’m sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. Your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

I really did fuck up, though. 


TLDR; I tried to raise awareness for Usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, Luke Stackpoole. My post made it to the front page and Reddit now hates me.

Edit: A nice Redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested I share the non-profit that donates to Usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - The Usher Syndrome Society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. Also, full disclosure: I am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!"

I was in the car running errands with my four year old son when he suddenly asks, ""Why are some people Joul-ish on Christmas?"" I vaguely remembered him watching some cartoons where bad guys want to steal Christmas, and I figured he meant ""jealous."" So I told him, ""Well, those people are not nice, and they're greedy, and they want all the toys for themselves and not share, and I don't want you to be like that at all."" He seemed to accept this and the conversation moved to something else.

This morning my husband asked me if I told our son that Jewish people wanted all the toys to themselves. I immediately realized what happened. My son's daycare celebrated Hannukah last week by coloring menorahs and making dreidels and he was curious about Jewish people.

TLDR: My son asked about Jewish people, but I thought he said ""jealous"" people and I explained how greedy those people are."

Since I don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, I agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. It ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

Our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. Don't break ANYthing, NO answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. He was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. This was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. He wore a black mask and black clothing.

Immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. As I mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. I didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and I guess they didn't either.

The escape room was history-themed. Computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. Lots of books stacked around.

The first thing I did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

I put in the first relevant number I thought of, 1492, the date Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas.

Lock opens.

Things got a thousand times more awkward.

I apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. The host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as I could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. He didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

Soonafter, I decided it'd be better if I just left, apologizing again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad I tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. I can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but I appreciate everyone assuring me I didn't FU. I agree with you on principle I suppose, but I also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. The escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. Dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. Thanks for all the positive responses!!"

First, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it’s a lot of fun when everyone’s enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend’s older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

It just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (We’ll call him L) got into a fight with another group of guys. Although he and his bro didn’t sustain too much damage from the fight (The other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) L and I got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. It would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

We caught up and chilled at a local public playground (Keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. Being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we’d deck the other and how we’d essentially easily F*ck the other up. We began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

It was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

All of a sudden, I say something stupid in a mock Japanese accent (I’m Asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at L, when this child that couldn’t be over 8 jumps in and says “Hiiyaahh”

I couldn’t stop my momentum and proceeded to YEET this kid into the sandpit... 

No amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

I went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. He wasn’t seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

His older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. I apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying I talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

His bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. All in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and I got to kick a child in the face... Win-Win.      (that’s a joke)

TL:DR
Best friend and I were pretend fighting in a public park and when I attempted to do a ridiculous kick I saw on UFC, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. Worth it.

Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, I am not worthy of this. I made this post at 12am last night and when I woke up, I was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

I appreciate you all!

Edit #2: I didn’t make one point clear enough regarding the playground. Besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. L and I made sure that our presence wasn’t making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn’t have even entered the playground area at all.

Hope that kinda clears some shiz up"

So my gf and I adopted a new kitten a week ago. She's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

Well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming ""OH FUCK!"" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

It took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

My girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..

TL:DR - I gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... To my new kitten...

gkyfrh,TIFU by calling my wife ugly for months,35318,0.93,1676,2020-05-16 22:52:21,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gkyfrh/tifu_by_calling_my_wife_ugly_for_months/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gkyfrh/tifu_by_calling_my_wife_ugly_for_months/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,,False,"My wife is great, let me start off with that. I am really shocked I ended up married to her; everybody that knows me never lets me forget how lucky I am. She is like a master at being functional, whereas I'm not. When we do household chores together, she gets this beatific expression of contentment; it's adorable. 

About three months ago, we were both in the yard; I was mowing and she was gardening (we live in WA state; it is warmish here in the winter). I couldn't help but notice how wonderful she looked. I stopped mowing, went over to her, and said something like ""I love you so much, you look so homely."" She seemed fine. A week or so later, I said it again. ""You are the most HOMELY person I've ever met."" She didn't seem to respond as expected; I just figured she was down. 

See, I thought ""homely"" was like some adorable snow white type shit; homes are cozy and make you feel safe, right? Here was my wife, going around the house, dusting and playing with the cat, saying hello to houseplants, and doing it in a way that gave me cozy, or what I thought were ""homely"" feelings. I kept calling her homely for another month or so; I could feel some distance between us but couldn't source it. Then it happened.

I got home from work, and went to give my (now sad and confused) wife a hug. ""My GOD you are just SO HOMELY!!"" She pushed me away, looked me right in the eyes, and said ""I...don't think you know what that means. You've been saying it for months, and I really think you have NO idea."" So I looked it up, and found that (at least in America) no, ""homely"" doesn't mean cute, or cozy. It means ugly or unattractive.  I thought I was complimenting my wife whenever I called her homely, when I was really just killing her soul a little bit at a time. With that unfortunate misunderstanding fixed, we are now doing fine. 

TL;DR   I thought ""homely"" meant cute, and ended up calling my wife homely for months. Found out that It means ugly. We both died inside.

Edit: To those who wonder why she took so long to tell me, all I can say is that I wondered the same thing. My wife is *extremely* chill; that's part of what I love about her. What she told me was ""Your body language didn't match up with the word."" Every time I called her homely, I projected an otherwise kind and loving presence. I think that dissonance really weirded her out. She's always struggled with assertiveness; that, her general chillness, and my strange demeanor was apparently a perfect storm that lead to repression.

Edit #2: We live in Western Washington, which is quite warm in the winter compared to the upper Midwest where I grew up. As long as the grass is green, it's warm to me."
c6t0m7,TIFU by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.,35305,0.91,2354,2019-06-29 07:31:18,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6t0m7/tifu_by_wearing_the_wrong_size_shoes_for_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6t0m7/tifu_by_wearing_the_wrong_size_shoes_for_my/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Okay, so by TIFU standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony I unintentionally put myself through, I think it qualifies.

I have fairly weird-sized feet.  They're very wide, but not all that long.  I have no arch to speak of.  I'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  I'm pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

Wrong.

When I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

As an adult, I assumed, well, since I'm full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  For me, that's a size 10 (US).

Problem was, I kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, I'll switch to size 10W.

Still no luck.  Still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  My running shoes were so ill-fitted that I actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

My friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5W Nikes.  I said, ""Sure, fuck it, I'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

Oh.  My.  God.

It was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  I was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  I had no idea how much misery I had been in until I wore those shoes.  I wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because I was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  There's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

TL;DR - I'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes."

Me and my girlfriend were sitting around bored during quarantine playing sporcle quizzes on the computer when somehow the question of what the average dick size is came up. Since we were sitting at a computer, I was like, well why not look it up? (This was my first mistake...)   
I pulled up this article that had a nice looking bell curve and you can look at the percentiles and what not. The average was around 5 inches or so, like yours truly. Then as she was looking she said ""Huh, I wonder where 9 inches falls on this graph"". At this moment, the gears started turning in my head.. What an oddly specific length to ask about. I ask her, ""why did you ask about 9 inches in particular??"" (my second mistake..) and then she casually mentioned that she had a \*COUPLE\* of exes that were 9 inches. A COUPLE!!! That's about as likely as dating two guys that are taller than 6'10""! (for perspective 6.3 inches was 95th percentile, 7 inches was 98th or something, so 9 is literally off the charts)  


Needless to say, I became super insecure and for the next few days we'd be in the middle of sexy time and all of a sudden the image of her getting dicked down by a monstrous 9 inch cock twice my size would pop in my head killing my mood. Like there's no way I can measure up.  Now a month later, I'm mostly over it but every once in a while the image pops in my head again and I think back to the moment where I wrote my own death sentence by asking questions I didn't want to know the answer to.

This happened about 20 mimiutes ago. I am currently bawling my eyes out from humiliation and shock. I will write out this event as if you were me. I will not include details before I knew them. 

It all started when I (f23) got home late from work. We had a meeting after the park was closed and didn't get home until 10pm. I take a shower and smoke my dab pen while drying my hair. (I then proceeded to forget the next hour) So, my hair was dry and I was playing Red Dead Online. I had just got comfy when I hear my cat Winnie make a strange meow. My cat only meows like this when she sees something outside. It's like a low yowl and not a cute meow. I pause the game and take my headphones off. She is meowing in the living room. She runs into the doorway to my bedroom and meows again. I follow her out into my living room which is only lit by a night light. I see that my motion activated light is on outside. Winnie is looking through the blinds and meows again and again. The light goes off and then comes back on. 

I call my roommate(m26). He is at work and gets off in an hour. I am fried at this point and I'm thinking that I am over reacting. Winnie meows louder and longer. Over and over. I'm freaking out and a shadow from my patio moves. A few seconds later, there is a knock on the door. I feel my heart in my ears. The heartbeats are really loud and everything is in slow motion. I'm staring at the door for what seems like about 30 seconds but was probably only 2 or 3. I dart to my room, lock my door, and then was in my closet with a large knife. I don't remember if I got the knife before or after the knocking. 

I'm on the phone to police. My breath is incredibly shaky and raspy. I'm having memories and images of my family and friends rushing through my head. Then I think of my parents and how I need to call them but I'm on the phone with 911 telling them info and location. I am mentally preparing to kill someone or die. The 911 dispatcher was silent. She said there were 2 officers close. 

Silence. 

I ask where they are. She tells me they are turning into my apartment. I wait the most painful 30 seconds of my life. If seriously felt like 10 minutes. I hear voices at my front door. 

I hear the dispatchers voice. 
She asks ""did you order delivery?"" 





TL:DR, I forgot I ordered delivery and called the cops on my delivery driver for delivering my food.

A couple of days ago my wife had a dream where I cheated on her and later leaving her to live with the other woman. She told me about her dream in the morning, clearly distressed. Trying to defuse the situation, I decided to create a funny origin story of the girl I was seeing in her dream. I named her Brumhilda, as this name doesn't exist where we live and I thought it added volume and certain mystery to her character. 

The next day I posted a funny comment on a Facebook page, and received a Haha reaction from a user named Brumhilda. I thought it was hilarious and showed it to my wife, who promptly sent me to sleep on the sofa

When I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

I was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don’t know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn’t a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.

I understand that everyone may think this isn’t a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn’t have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.

Tl;Dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks I’m about to blow up the elevator.

And one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn’t seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what I wrote first :)

When I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

I woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn't move it at all.
At first I didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

During my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
However my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

It appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

Now I'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

My very pregnant wife wakes up and I am already awake, having made coffee for myself and prepared tea in anticipation for a relaxed morning.   I’m watching a PBS special about WWII submarines and she sat down with her tea and started to watch.   

So my wife isn’t a huge history buff and I am constantly reminding her of the order of commonly-known events.   She is incredibly intelligent but she apparently had a very boring history teacher and never absorbed the information.  As such, she had no idea that submarines
were actually torpedo-carrying murder machines that were designed to blow up their enemies.  

I look at her and she’s bawling…tears running down her face and she says, “But I thought submarines were just like for exploration and fun and stuff.”  I chalk it up to hormones, but I really ruined a nice morning.

TL;DR made my pregnant wife cry when she found out that submarines are war machines

Edit:

Wow, went to sleep and this got a bit hairy.   Thank you to those who understand pregnancy brain and found this as cute, albeit shocking as I did. No thank you to those who went straight to calling my wife horrible things or assuming anything else about her, and a big FU to those saying anything mean about my kids.  Without going into much detail, yes, she had a sheltered childhood where she didn’t encounter submarines all too often, in the water, on land, or in the media.  I guess her parents never gave her the “submarine talk”.  She does in fact know a lot more about the grisly details of war now, as we have been trying to get her up to date, especially about the world wars.  She may have had an inkling before that submarines were evil, but I don’t think it was something she wanted to hear that morning.  Pretty sure she thought they were used in war, but just for spying on the enemy. Be nice, and may you all keep your heads above water."

Now, I don’t beat my kids in fact, I’ve never laid a hand on them. You see, my kids train in jiu jitsu and have been going hard on their training now that COVID restrictions have been relaxed.

It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.

My favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.

This morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

TL:DR below. Sorry for the length. Didn't realize all this word vomit would end up being somehat cathartic. 

Last night I decided to get into my car completely naked. I had one job. Meet my gf at her place. Drive us back to my place. End of story. No stripping required. However. As the day was coming to an end, the anticipation of spending time alone with my gf was clouding my judgment. All of a sudden I was horny and thinking it would be kind of kinky to show up naked behind the wheel and saying something silly like ""excuse me, ma'am... did you call an Uber X?"". I was rock hard thinking about the risk factor and how my gf would react. I imagined her laughing at the absurdity but also being somewhat turned on by the nudity. I wasn't too worried about other people catching me because my plan was not to interact with anyone else and to stay in the car until I was back inside my garage. 

I realized I fucked up the moment I pulled into the parking bay and noticed my gf standing in the rain with an umbrella and her two roommates huddled underneath. All of them were frantically waving at me like ""OMG, please hurry, it's pouring"". I had two choices. Proceed as planned and accept my fate. Or preserve my dignity and leave my gf and her roommates in the rain. I drove my naked ass out of there feeling conflicted as fuck. In my defense, there was never any mention of roommates joining us. My gf called and assumed I didn't see them somehow. I apologized and explained, albeit fearfully, why she just witnessed me drive away without her. I promised I'd be back to pick them up in 30 minutes or less. Fully dressed. It was tricky trying to pinpoint if my gf was entertained or annoyed during that phone call. That being said, I couldn't help but feel like I was pushing her buttons when I asked her to lie to her roommates about my reason for fleeing the premises. 

My gf said it wouldn't be necessary to tell lies because she had me on loudspeaker the entire time. Crickets. I fucking died inside. I could hear the roommates laughing in the background before one of them said ""tell him to turn around"". At that moment, another call came through. Unknown number. My saving grace. Or so I thought. I said goodbye to my gf and discovered it was my mother who didn't realize she was still using her work phone after hours. My mom asked where I was because she just arrived at my place. I said I wasn't home and stressed what a bad time it was for her to pop in unannounced. She said she had leftover lasagna for me. My favourite. I said I'd be home in a few minutes and made it clear that when I arrive I'm gonna drive directly into my garage and open the front door from the inside. I emphasized that she should remain in her car, out of the rain, and under no circumstances should she approach me until she saw me in the house looking decent. 

My mom approached me as soon as she heard me honk. Her vehicle was blocking my driveway but instead of getting out of the way so I could access my garage and avoid being seen in the nude, she got out of her car without warning and marched to my car with a plate of lasagna wrapped in tinfoil. I was tempted to drive away again, but I didn't have the balls to abandon both women in my life on the same night in the same way. I rolled down my window and said ""mother, stop"". She did not stop. Not until she realized I was wearing nothing but my seat belt. I asked her to please move her vehicle and not ask questions. She caught me naked. Of course she asked questions. Lots of questions. 

I made it sound like it was nothing more than a dumb prank between friends but my mom was convinced I was under the influence of her nemesis, Satan. I knew what that meant. She was using Satan as a metaphor to describe my gf, which she's done before. Usually I'd bite and we would argue but I didn't have time to dive into that debate because once I was done getting dressed, I had to leave again. On my way out, my mom proceeded to pray out loud. I froze at the door and had to wait until she was done updating God about yet another classic example of how her son was being tempted by the flesh into committing acts of indecency. As usual it was over the top theatrics and passive aggressive slut shaming towards my gf. Somehow all of this was her fault, not mine, I was just a victim of a Jezebel. It took everything in my power not to lose my shit during that prayer.  

Fast forward to the most uncomfortable car ride of my life. My gf didn't really make conversation (or eye contact) other than asking if I didn't mind dropping her roommates at the mall. I could tell she was embarrassed by me. It was my first time meeting her roommates in person and it was obvious they didn't know how to behave around me. I apologized to all of them for my actions and promised never to leave my house naked again. Not gonna lie, acknowledging what I did made it even more awkward. I got zero replies. Just forced smiles. My gf turned on the radio instead of talking to me. Due to the bad weather we had one radio station available. A talk station. So, there we all were, awkwardly listening to people who suffer from misophonia discuss how disturbing specific sex sounds were to them. Fuck last night. 

**TL:DR Made plans to pick up my gf. Got horny thinking about her. Decided to drive naked as a sexy surprise. Realized my gf was waiting for me with her roommates. Left them all in the rain to go home and put on something to wear. Got caught by my religious mom who happened to be at my house. Had to listen to her badmouth my gf with Satan metaphors and prayer. Got dressed. Returned to my gf and her roommates. Cue awkward car ride.**"

Recently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I'd go along. 

So anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

I think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

So I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I'm met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

I then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" I murmur. 
The teacher nods. 

Now everyone thinks I'm a massive racist.

TL : DR whites go first in chess refers to the pieces and not the people playing"
seaoa3,TIFU when I pulled a deaf woman over for speeding and asked to see her Vagina,34972,0.83,1407,2022-01-28 04:02:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/seaoa3/tifu_when_i_pulled_a_deaf_woman_over_for_speeding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/seaoa3/tifu_when_i_pulled_a_deaf_woman_over_for_speeding/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"Well for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. 
To set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. 
Well one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself “great I get to use a new talent in the field”. 
I indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. 
I then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off.  I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn’t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. 
I again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. 
Now to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6’2 230 lbs. and she is about 5’2 and maybe 100lbs. 
This poor girl was FREAKED OUT! 
I finally realize I haven’t stopped a serial killer and simply ask “well why?” To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. 
Well my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing “ I am a police officer, show me your vagina!”
I still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn’t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking  as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I’m glad I got that one right at least)
Needless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. 
TL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues."

Her proposal was that if she won a game of Mario Kart against me, she could do anything she wanted with me, and if I won, I could do anything I wanted with her.

Little did she know how good at Mario Kart I was.

The first couple of victories were harmless enough.  I'd win the race, and I'd say things like ""you've got to talk like Wario for the next race,"" or ""I get to borrow your DVD's,"" most of which was wildly amusing and diabolical for me to ask of her.

But the thing about it is that I kept winning, and being the dope I was, I thought I was on a hot streak getting all this free stuff from her and I played it up like I was some kind of pompous court jester gallivanting across the courtyard.

Every now and again, she'd put the same offer back on the table, and I'd keep winning, and she would make her frustration known the more she kept losing races in Mario Kart.

And it didn't help that I'd brag about my victories within our circle of friends, celebrating with invisible trophies and spraying imaginary champagne.

It wouldn't be until we were older and grown apart that she would disclose to me that she was a little upset by the whole thing, because she would practice playing Mario Kart for HOURS before racing against me in the hopes of winning.

And the reason she wanted to win was because she found me to be handsome and didn't know how to initiate this attraction she had.

The whole time, she was hoping that I would ask for a kiss from her whenever I would win, but me being the dumbass I was kept asking to borrow her Linkin Park albums and to draw buff kittens with sleeve tattoos.

So not only did I miss my shot with my friend, I also broke her heart every time I would clench victory from her on the final lap, performing the miracle last second overtake monouver or cackling like a cartoon villain whenever the spiky blue shell of doom would nuke her dreams.

TL;DR My female friend wanted to win a game of Mario Kart against me so she could kiss me but never won, and I kept winning and asking for anything except physical intimacy."

I was talking to this guy on Hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, I thought he was the one. After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

Since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn’t had time to meet each other’s parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I’ll bring you over to meet my parents, and I’ll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

Long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend’s mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle’s daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn’t seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn’t right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. I told my friends that it didn’t work out and silently removed everything from social media..

TLDR; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner

Edit: Okay, too many comments about if we had sex.... and yes, your imaginations are now filled.."

I (f) met my friend's (m) fiance a couple of months ago when he moved with her back to his home town. The fiance and I got on well enough and we tentatively started to form a friendship.
The night before their wedding, my friend stayed over at his brother's. 
I stayed the night at their house with the bride. She had no friends or family in town and I was by default the bridesmaid.
Feeling kind of sorry for her for not having had a Bachelorette party or anyone around, I suggested that we go out to have a few drinks, celebrate her last few hours of singlehood. 
She agreed. I ordered a beer and a tequila each for the first round, thinking that we'd start with a shooter, have a few beers and end off with a shooter, nothing wild. I didn't want to be the cause of a severely hungover bride.
After the first tequila hit her stomach, she changed, became more animated, I put it down to just pre-wedding excitement.
No one told me that she was a recovering addict who hasn't had a drink in 4 years. No one. 
In the past when I visited, my friend and myself would drink beer and she wouldn't, I always thought that it was because she wasn't particularly fond of beer or alcohol. I have lots of girl friends like that, who will only drink on certain occasions.
But I like beer - (the Hon. Brett Kavanaugh)

The bride started chugging beers and shooters like a fratboy. I tried to stop her, she wouldn't listen to reason. She became more and more aggressive, so I just backed off. Had I known then what I know now, I would've made a bigger effort, even if that may have meant a black eye or bloody nose for me.

As Murphy would have it, she chose the exact moment to go to the restroom as a girl who was doing lines in the stall next to hers. The bride asked and got given. Anything for the Bride, right? 'Oh my gawd, oh wonderful, you're getting married tomorrow, here's another'
The night went downhill from there. She was like a freight train, with me barely hanging on.
She phoned her husband-to-be and told him that the wedding was off, that she's changed her mind.
I felt like dog-shit.

I eventually managed to get her home at around 04h00. He was waiting for her. She screamed at him and he shouted at me. 
They postponed the wedding.

I feel so, so bad.  I never wanted to cause shit for either one of them.

TL;DR I took my friend's fiance out for a drink the night before their wedding, thinking I was doing a nice thing. Didn't realize that she was a recovering addict and the wedding got postponed."

We ended up talking in the same circle and he introduces himself. We start chatting and quickly find the circle around us has disappeared and it is just us. 

He is so smart, his smile is outrageously cute, and I love how he seems laser focused on me instead of one of the many attractive women that have now joined the party and are talking about their cool Raya dates. 

As the night wore on, I found myself talking to various different groups, but, each time this guy would appear again and we'd end up just talking to each other again. Someone who neither of us knew came up and said we made an attractive couple, and I realized somehow in the span of two hours we were already acting like a couple. It wasn't just being sexually attracted to him, I felt so comfortable around him and he was so attentive to my needs. 

I told him offhand I had allergies to the dog at the party. Hours later when I started sneezing he immediately knew why and moved us outside. His smile was the thing that immediately caught my attention but it was the thoughtfulness that made it so at the end of the night, we catch an Uber home together and end up kissing. Before the Uber drops him off I give him my number. 

Sunday comes, don't hear from him. Ok, ok, I get it, we both got home at 4am and I too just want to sleep the day away. 

Monday comes. Silence. 

Tuesday, even more silence. I know I've read how it is ""uncool"" to text a girl immediately because you want to seem super cool and wanted, but we're both in our mid-thirties and, I hoped, realized these mind games are bullshit. If you like someone, text them when you can. Life is too short to be with people half-interested in you. 

Wednesday comes and I'm a mixture of angry and over it and insecure all at the same time. How dare he lead me on like this! ...Well, I guess I'm glad I only wasted one night on this asshole....was I not pretty enough? All these thoughts raced through my head and coalesced into me typing his name and work place into Google to see if I can find him. 

Turns out, he was incredibly easy to find. I was planning on just looking at him because I missed his face, but I accidentally clicked the link that brought me to his LinkedIn page. Yikes! Now he'll know that I stalked him which made me feel even worse. >.< I probably looked crazy. 

Welp, since I was already on his page I guess I'd look at where he had worked. Maybe he wasn't really interesting and I'd feel better about him ghosting me. 

Nope, turns out he is not only very smart but also humble because his resume listed a dozen different cool jobs, impressive schools he's attended, things he's worked on. Great, I probably wasn't impressive enough for him. -_- 

Not thirty minutes later he friends me on LinkedIn, but seems surprised that I was reaching out. He had evidently texted me that night, and again the next day, only to not hear anything back. I had ghosted him. 

And this is how we found out my fuck up. When I gave him my number, turns out I was off by a digit. Turns out, tipsy me isn't so great at typing or proofreading. 

If I hadn't been a creepy LinkedIn stalker, it could have been months, if ever, before we would have seen each other again. Right now we're laughing about it and setting up our first real date. Wish me luck Reddit!

TL;DR Thought a cute guy was ghosting me. Turns out, I gave him the wrong number. Fixed my fuck up by using my cyber stalking skills, and now we're going on a date!"

Warning... poop talk below!

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months and absolutely DO NOT discuss bathroom habits. Nothing. So, I can't share this horrible fuck up with him so I'm telling it to you nasty people. 

We've been quarantining together at his place for about a month and it's been really great. Tonight, I just got finished with a run and decided to take a hot steamy shower. But first, I had to empty the tank (runners will know the feeling). After, I hop into the shower and do my thing. 

Now, I don't know how you people wash your butt but here's how I do it - I get the washcloth nice and sudsy, wipe down all my crevices, and then lean forward facing opposite of the shower head, spread the cheeks,  and let the water pressure get in there. Well, I must have been REALLY relaxed because next thing I know... there is poop on the bottom of the bathtub. Like a decent sized log. I didn't even feel it come out. I am HORRIFIED and kind of stare at it for a few seconds wondering how this just escaped me. I quickly lean out of the shower to grab some toilet paper and guess what... the poop slithered down towards the drain! Now I have the poop stuck in the water stream and only being held up by the drain, so without thinking, I try to grab it, only for it to be smashed down and liquified even further. Fuck!!!!

I turned the water off and grab a new piece of TP. I tried wiping the inside of the drain, but it just made it even worse. Now I added wet TP pieces to the mix. I unscrew the drain cap and let it run in the sink, only for even smaller pieces of poop to come out and get stuck in THAT drain! I repeat the process and finally get the sink drain clean. 

10 minutes pass and my boyfriend is still wondering why I'm in the bathroom even though the water is turned off. 

Back to the bathtub drain - I keep wiping and just keep getting more poop! Does he poop in the shower too?! There is no way this is just from me! He had some cleaner under the sink so I sprayed the living shit out of the drain and hoped it was fine. 

It doesn't stop there. All of that TP I was using? Yeah, I was tossing it into the toilet. When I finally got my drain situation under control, I flushed the toilet... only for it to be clogged with so much toilet paper. And he doesn't have a plunger. So now I've been in this bathroom for a solid 40 minutes and need to explain to my boyfriend that I clogged his toilet - but not from massive shits - but from toilet paper, because I pooped in his shower (????).

Well, I had to say something, so I left the bathroom red as a lobster and explained I accidentally flushed a tampon and it clogged the toilet so I need to run to the pharmacy to procure a plunger. 

He believed me. 

Taking new butt washing suggestions now...

**TLDR:** My bowels were so relaxed that I accidentally pooped in my boyfriend's shower. I had a hard time hiding the evidence.

EDIT: Since many of you need clarification... here you go. Yes, I DID poop before I showered. i thought I was all emptied out. By “decent log,” I would say it was the size of my thumb. It was a decent size for something I didn’t feel. I forgot that we all have different perspectives of what decent looks like. After reading the comments, I think what happened is that I gave myself an accidental enema. When I’m washing away, I like to get ALLLLLLLLLL the places clean, and I think the hot water jet made the bad things happen. I am a healthy person otherwise, but thank you for your concerns 😍"

That thought was on my mind this morning when I woke up next to my wife. The morning sunlight made her skin glow with an aura I'm sure one could only see through my eyes.

I shuffled over to her side of the bed, trying to be as gentle as I could. I wanted to preserve that moment but I couldn't resist the urge to be closer to her.

I settled in with my head laying next to hers and looking directly into her beautiful blue eyes. Her closed lids could never hide what I know to be the most lovely pair of eyes I've ever seen.

She must have felt me there because her eyes began to slowly open.

Just when I thought I couldn't feel any more content in my life, she smiles at me.

I smile right back at her and with the thought of communication on my mind I promptly said "" You don't let me spoon with you while we sleep because you'll fart on my dick right?""

She hasn't spoken to me since.

TLDR: I asked my wife if she was afraid of farting on my dick.

Wife won't talk to me."
cv8utv,TIFU by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when I took them out,34704,0.93,1175,2019-08-25 19:32:12,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cv8utv/tifu_by_leaving_my_ear_tubes_in_for_13_years_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cv8utv/tifu_by_leaving_my_ear_tubes_in_for_13_years_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Happened this week and I just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.

Context: I've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. 

I've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. In fact they've helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It's awesome. 

So here's where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn't believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.

My surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it's completely different to what I've come to know over the course of my life. I can't really tell if I'm whispering or shouting just yet because I've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. 

PARENTS: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood.

Hi Reddit! As promised, here is a follow-up! I found him! 

And ironically, Reddit had nothing to do with the reconnection, but I appreciate how sweet and supportive the Reddit community has been in trying to help me.

# So here's the full story:

I tried the GPS-spoofing Tinder hack so many of you suggested and was able to land my account in Gangnam, Seoul where I initially was when I matched with him. But to my dismay, I couldn't find him at all. I narrowed down my options to his age-range, but it still didn't work. My index finger was swiping left constantly, that I felt like a broken record. I swiped left on hundreds of guys until eventually, there were no more matches to be found.

So I finally decide to replay the entire date over again in my head and suddenly recall my date explaining how he signed up for a language exchange app to learn English and how he's an active member. I didn't recall the name of the app, but it was a total big-brained move that I didn't utilize the power bequeathed before my very hands, which was google. So now, with a million fewer IQ points, I search ""language exchange apps popular in Korea"" and was presented with a few options. Immediately one of the icons displayed looked very familiar! *""That's the one"",* I thought, ""t*hat's the app that he showed me during our date"".* I rushed to the app store to download the app and impatiently fill out the prompts to create a new account. I selected the ""want to learn Korean"" and ""want to teach English"" options. Finally, I was done creating my profile. The app told me it would take up to 7 days to approve of my account, so I can start finding language exchange partners.  Since this was my only lead left, I unwillingly played the waiting game. 

An hour later, I receive a notification that my account was approved! I rushed to the app and nervously scanned the Korean profiles that popped up in my feed.  There were profiles after profiles of teen girls with straight black hair and wispy bangs trying to emulate their favorite k-pop idol, or middle-aged guys with unflattering selfie angles, but none of them was the guy I was looking for. I was a bit dejected but found out that the premium subscription allowed me to search for specific users. I fidget around, trying to find my date from the free user's list, but was finding very little luck with that method. I caved in, shelling out the $20 for the premium subscription, justifying that it makes sense to pay for it because at least I'll get to practice speaking different languages. (although that was just an excuse to hopefully rekindle with him). Once my transaction was complete, I accessed the search bar and typed in his Tinder alias. My reasoning was that since his actual, Korean, name is so common (think John Smith), he wouldn't put it on the app. I held my breath, waiting for the results to show up... but no results were found. I was slightly disappointed but did not lose hope. Maybe by a stroke of luck, searching by his Korean name would work? I was doubtful, but grasping at whichever straws I had left. From past experience, searching up his Korean name on facebook gave me more than a hundred results, but none of them were him. I typed in his Korean name and pressed enter. I resumed holding my breath and prayed that this would work. The words ""2 results"" popped up on my screen. I frantically looked at the results. The first profile was a buff dude with a gnarly bleached blonde goatee. ""*Not my guy,""* I dismissed*.* Then I quickly glimpsed at the second profile and my eyes widened and my heart froze. It was *him.* It was the guy I so desperately tried to find this past week. 

I clicked on his profile, but suddenly, my anxiety kicked in. *What if I message him and he thinks I'm too desperate and is turned off?* I panicked but forced myself to initiate a message anyways. Like what was I going to say? ""*Hey sorry for ghosting you for a week, are we gucci?""  What if he's mad? What if he doesn't like me anymore?* I took a deep breath to clear my mind and tried to articulately explain my situation in a few sentences. I repeatedly revised and deleted parts of my opening message before I finally decided to take the dive and hit send.

Then it was playing the waiting game again. One perk about being a premium member on this app was that you got to see when users are active. After a few minutes, the app said he was active right now. ""*Great*"", I thought optimistically, *""he'll message me soon, and we'll clear up all misunderstandings""*. Minutes went by and he didn't respond. *That's okay, maybe he's in a conversation with someone else...* Several minutes turned into an hour, and one hour turned into two hours. My stomach churned. Maybe I really did FU by not being cautious enough with my messaging apps. I mean, what kind of sick psychological game was this, making me receive a taste of my own medicine?

Every time my phone buzzed with a notification from the language app, my ears perked up a bit. But it was always some middle-aged guy propositioning me for sex or a white dude with yellow fever trying to use the new pickup lines he learned in Japanese. Occasionally, I'd get a wholesome friend request from someone genuinely trying to learn English, but nevertheless, out of all the 32 messages I received, none were from my date. Yet, I gave him the benefit of the doubt from experiencing how overwhelming the app could be within those 2 hours. I changed my language exchange profile to exactly mirror my Tinder profile and put my language exchange profile on high visibility mode so that he would notice it. Suddenly, I got an influx of messages from various users in addition to the Reddit notifications from my previous TIFU. I couldn't stand it and temporarily muted all my notifications on my phone and headed to class for 4 hours. After class, I was ready to cut my losses and understood if my date didn't want to contact me again. However, I decided to open up the app after class and check my messages, not expecting anything to happen. But still, within me was a nestled hope, that he still wanted to reach out to me.

And there it was, nestled within all the other messages was an unread message from my date. Even though I said I was ready to cut my losses just a few minutes before, I couldn't help but squeal. I couldn't stop my smiling and did an excitement lap around the hallway outside my classroom. He seemed genuinely **happy** that I found him again and that he could keep in contact with **me**! I was jumping for joy on the way back home. We resumed our conversation from the week before as if nothing happened!

Later in the day, he called me (through the language app), and we talked about our crazy weeks. I'm just so glad to have found him again and talk to him about various topics. I don't need some crazy intense romcom-esque relationship, I'm just content with just keeping in contact and seeing what goes from there!

**TL;DR:** Found my date I  accidentally ghosted on a language exchange app after relentless searching because my brain decided to remember something important.

I want to thank Reddit for putting the effort into helping me find the guy! Your support helped me gain the courage to take the extra step into searching for him <3

Edit: apparently the app I used doesn’t need premium to search for users. Fml, I’m out of $20

Edit 2: I THINK HE READ THE POST, HE’S ASKING ME ODDLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ABORT

Edit 3: False alarm, he just added my alternate (non banned) Kakao account because apparently he literally has no other social media. We talked more and he said he was afraid I hated him after ghosting him LOL. He reconfirmed that he had a great time on our date! I decided to stop being a scared b*tch and told him I was glad to have met him again. We’re supposed to video call tomorrow! Yay"

This is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. So, it's mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. 

So I go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

You see, the problem with that was that the person I slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

Everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. Now the teacher's face goes bright red, and I'm starting to freak out thinking I'm doomed. 

Except, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, ""Hewy (not my real name but username will do). Save that for after class"" with a big grin on his face.

Everyone at this point bursts out laughing as I'm sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking I was about to get kicked out of school. 

God, I love my teach hahaha

TL;DR
I was having a good day in class, when I mistakingly slapped my teachers ass and get totally embarrassed by the comment he makes at the end of it."

Sometimes it was a harmless little fudge, sometimes a great big whopper with real consequences. For one example, working for Diwrecked-TV had me lying so much I could have been Pinocchio's twin brother, and I'm ashamed to say the incentives for doing so were enough that I got *very good* at lying my face off.

I like my current job well enough, and they've generally been good enough to me, that I made the foolish mistake of thinking ""they might be different this time"". So a few days ago I (correctly) stated that one potential reason someone's yearly bill went up nearly 50% is because the COVID-related crisis is eating our company's lunch like a playground bully.

Hahahaha NO. *Big* mistake. This morning my immediate supervisor chewed my ass like a pit bull's squeaky bone, complete with CC'ing it to the Big Cheese (asshole!) and a form to sign. Henceforth I am to stick to two sentences that boil down to: ""the math is hard and the numbers are right, what else can I (not) help you with?""

I'm just glad that we are still working remotely so I'm spared the inevitable lecture from Oscar the Grouch for my unintentional slip-up.

TL;DR - told truth, got reamed.

fdrri1,"TIFU by opening 10,000 porn tabs at school",34636,0.86,1252,2020-03-05 12:57:52,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fdrri1/tifu_by_opening_10000_porn_tabs_at_school/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fdrri1/tifu_by_opening_10000_porn_tabs_at_school/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"A bit of context first:

So yesterday I was working on an assignment (due tomorrow) and my “friend” steals my USB with all of my saved work on it (because it also has games on it that he wants).This would not normally be an issue, but then goes on to copy one game and DELETE ALL OF ITS CONTENTS. I was extremely pissed and asked to see the recycle bin, which he refused to show me, then telling me later that day that he deleted it bc he’s a dickhead like that. Fortunately I still had an auto saved copy from a while back, but I still lost a lot of work.

Fast forward to today, I’m thinking how I can get him back, when I have an idea. I got one of the old COD games from my friend and set it up so that when the game folder was opened, it ran a batch command that opened a porn website over and over. I knew he would try stealing it again and couldn’t wait for him to be busted. Just when I was ready to lay the trap I went to edit the file and instead of right clicking, I opened it. My mouse cursor instantly slowed from the thousands of searches at once so i shut down my laptop. Minutes later when I had restarted my computer I got a message popup from the school IT department telling me to take my laptop up to the office. They called my parents and I got sent home and now I’m facing suspension and have to have my laptop in teacher’s view for the rest of the term. After today my phone is being confiscated until my parents believe I have learned my lesson. I guess it’s karma and all but I still wish this guy had opened it because his parents are very strong Christians and he would have copped it much worse than me.

TL;DR: I tried to prank a classmate by getting him to open many porn tabs in class with a file command but I opened it and got myself in a load of shit.

Edit: turns out he didn’t remove from his recycle bin, getting it back tomorrow and no hard feelings

Edit 2: my parents ended up not confiscating my phone, but I can’t use my PC until end of term so hooray I guess

Edit 3: For all the people asking, it was a shortcut that was made to look identical to a folder apart from a tiny arrow at the bottom so that it ran the command on click. Sorry for not clarifying

Edit 4: I apologize for not knowing how to spell batch lol"

She then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. It’s all very sweet and heartfelt. Now, I in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say “You know in programming it means end”.

She doesn’t say anything.

I don’t say anything.

Song played at work. Let's just say If the customers in the store didn't what ""WAP"" stood for, they definitely did by the time we managed to turn it off.

I’m a key holder at a children’s toy store. We have two CDs that we’re allowed to play that have songs deemed “suitable” for the store. One of the CDs is your typical kids’ sing-alongs, “Wheels on the Bus”, “Old MacDonald'', all that jazz. The other is this weird folk CD that has the worst rendition of “Oh, Canada!” I have heard in my life. So naturally, I made a playlist on Spotify with family-friendly tunes that I could put on when my manager wasn’t there that didn’t make my brain turn to mush and dribble out my ears. 

This morning before my shift, I wanted to update the work playlist as it was getting a little stale so I did the quick add option that allows you to go through your liked songs and just click them to add them to the selected playlist. Awesome, great, gonna have some fresh tunes to get me through my closing shift.

I’m at work, about two hours in and my coworker tells me her till needs a drop (there’s too much money in the till and I have to open it and count out $200). While I do this, the back room (where my phone is connected to the store speakers) is locked to prevent anyone going in and waiting for me back there when I bring the cash back to the safe. 

So I'm counting an insane amount of 5 dollar bills when all of the sudden the speakers start blaring “WHORES IN THIS HOUSE, THERE’S SOME WHORES IN THIS HOUSE” and my blood runs cold. Oh my ever-loving fuck, I added “WAP” to a children store’s playlist. I look up and see looks of horror on the faces of women and innocent children. 

I panic and go to shut the till so I can run and turn off the music but remember my manager telling me that if I shut the till without taking out the correct amount of money, I would be in a world of trouble. In her words exactly, “Everything comes second to the handling of cash.” And I wasn’t about to call my manager and tell her that it had to come 2nd to Cardi B talking about her “wet ass pussy”. So I start yelling for my coworker to grab the keys from around my neck and open the backroom door. She grabs the keys and sprints to the backroom door but yells back that she doesn’t know what key it is. I describe it to her and she tries it but says it’s not working. I’m furiously counting the money but the panic is making it hard to keep track of how much I’m actually taking. 

Finally, my coworker gets into the backroom and turns off the music but not before Megan Thee Stallion has the pleasure of informing us all that “If he ate my ass, he’s a bottom feeder”. 

I quickly finish counting the cash and make sure of the amount before I do what can only be called the Walk-of-Shame to the backroom, avoiding eye contact with all the angry mothers in the store. I get back there and see that I did in fact add “WAP” to the store playlist. I give myself a moment to breathe before putting on my best customer service voice and speaking over the intercom, 

“Good Evening, Customers. On behalf of \[STORE NAME\], I would like to apologize for the technical difficulties. We hope to make it up to you by offering free gift wrapping on unlimited items\*. Thank you and have a fantastical night.”

\*Gift wrapping is already free.

Let’s just say I welcomed back “Oh, Canada!” with open arms after this."

This story is told all the time in my life by my parents, so I hope you enjoy it.

I'm British with a Welsh dad and Portuguese mum. Mum wanted me raised to not be a stereotypical British teenager sneaking out lying about going to a mates house and passing out from drinking vodka in a field, so she got me drinking tiny amounts of wine at dinner time from the age of 5/6. We're talking a shot of wine, no more. They learned their lesson after I got shitfaced aged 5 off of brandy (story in the comments).

Me being autistic got super into this and wanted to try all the different red wines we had, and I asked lots of questions. It became a little special interest of mine when I was 8. For those who are unfamiliar, if you're not baptised into the church as a baby, you can do a combo baptism/first holy communion as a kid through Catholic school. I did this in primary school so I would have a place at the best secondary school in my city, which happened to be Catholic.

Like weddings, you have a dress rehearsal for the first holy communion, with the priest. It's a whole goddamn mass, except instead of 300 people in the bigass church, it's the 10 or 20 people in the ceremony and family/godparents to be as well. So being a dress rehearsal, there's a full communion with the wine and wafers to be Top Lad Jesus' blood and body.

I was doing so good at being a normal kid during the ceremony until this part. Then it was Special Interest Activation Mode. See the priest doesn't really expect kids having communion to drink the wine, they expect you to hold the goblet and give it back. Well, not me, and not this time - I swirled that goblet, sniffed it, said ""wait this is familiar"", had a sip, SHRIEKED, and turned to my parents jumping yelling ""MUM, DAD, THIS IS BLOSSOM HILL! IT'S THAT GRENACHE WE HAD LAST WEEK!!""

My parents have never been so fucking humiliated in their lives. We bailed the rehearsal, was told to be silent during the real one, and shortly moved churches. I think the priest thought I had the devil in me and was some alcoholic kid, because the bastard tried to drown me during the official baptism and there's a video of me coughing my guts up lmao.

Tl;dr: my parents got me an autistic kid to develop a special interest in wine which bit them in the ass when I got baptised and had my first communion at church.

---‐‐------------

EDIT: Due to a comment bug the brandy story is an addendum here.

Brandy story:

When I was 5, I kept getting recurrent bronchitis. It lasted over 6 months, the antibiotics just weren't curing it and they had to keep getting stronger ones.

It tasted of fake banana and the texture of it was giving me autistic meltdowns. My dad could not rationalise a 5 year old to keep taking the antibiotics so he started experimenting to try and make it palatable.

First he added sugar. Still gross. Then fruit squash. Still gross. Tried another batch with fruit juice. Even worse.

At this point he was losing the will to live and probably losing interest in me living and so desperate times call for desperate measures. The final form of this Ring of Fire bronchitis medicine, the secret ingredient: brandy. Lots of brandy.

Did I like it? Hell no, but it knocked me out cold so it gave him the goddamn peace and quiet he wanted."

I was reminded by my friends' snapchat memories of this absolutely awful experience one year ago.

So I'm a junior in college now (I was a sophomore then) and I work for a club on campus that raises money for a charity that gives money to families of children with cancer to ease the financial burden of things like hospital bills and hotel rooms for treatment, etc. At the end of the year, we throw a 10-hour long concert which usually involves a lot of student DJs doing quick sets to pass the time.

Anyways, we needed someone to fill in for a half hour set, so I thought, ""why not?"" and plugged my laptop in, ran some cheap DJ software, and played some pop music off a playlist. All is well, right?
Well, as it turns out, all was not not well. I was unknowingly playing ""Die Young"" by Kesha which contains the lyrics:
>Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young // We're gonna die young // We're gonna die young

Not long after, I got a text from my friend and the conversation went something like:
> dude change the song // ??? // you're playing die young // and? // the kids are here // oh fuck

I look around and everyone is staring at me thinking this is some cruel joke because all of the patients we sponsor are at the event. I quickly changed to ""I Gotta Feeling"" and all was well. Luckily, none of the kids were listening too closely and didn't get upset. I got a stern talking to by the club advisors, but they ended up letting me go because they couldn't prove that I played it on purpose. That night, we ended up raising $121,000, so... silver linings, right?

TL;DR: I played a pre-set playlist at a children's cancer fundraiser. Kesha's ""Die Young"" came on. Got a talking to.

EDIT: Realized I probably shouldn't include the name of the charity in this post.

EDIT 2: hijacking my own post to try to turn these upvotes into some donations to the charity. If you’re interested in giving, ~~here is the link.~~

EDIT 3: Decided to remove the charity again to not violate Rule 5. If you feel strongly about donating, PM me."

I was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

In the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.

The box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

I just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..

TL;DR: Got a gift from a girl I really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside."
chllvg,TIFU By telling my best friend I love her when I thought I was going to die,34505,0.92,2258,2019-07-25 15:21:14,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/chllvg/tifu_by_telling_my_best_friend_i_love_her_when_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/chllvg/tifu_by_telling_my_best_friend_i_love_her_when_i/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway because I don't want this to be on my main account:


Obbligatory ""This didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

Also please forgive my spelling mistakes because I'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

So, last week I was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. I wasn't paying too much attention (I assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Yes I'm an idiot I know lesson learned. WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS KIDS! Anyway, it was just starting to rain and I saw a KID ABOUT TO GO INTO THE ROAD. For the life of me I still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. I was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

Now, I was going quite fast and as I said, did not have a seat belt on. Next thing I knew I was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. No pain, no panic, nothing. I just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever had in my life. I just laid there, not knowing what to do. I heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. I thought I was going to die. There was a lot of blood.

You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? Well that didn't quite happen but I did start thinking about who I care about and who I love. Here's where I tell you about my best friend. A girl I've been in love with for around two years, I never let her know and never intended too. She is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and I didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy I'm happy. There's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. But I thought I was literally dying, and all I could think about was her in those moments. The pain was starting to kick in but I was just thinking about how she'd never know how much I loved her.

I realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force I could muster I took it out. It was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message I could sent was an ""I love you"" to her. I thought that would be the last message I'd ever send.

I don't remember much after that. Days have been a blur. I've had quite a few operations, AKI due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. But my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like I got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! All I do is sleep and appreciate the fact I'm alive. The other driver and the kid were okay btw.
Anyway, as you can see, I did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but I can't undo that message I sent. I've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. I told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. Earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. I haven't replied yet and I don't want to. I don't know what to do. So far I've been writing this TIFU as procrastination and then after this I plan on taking a long nap. Thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



TLDR: Got in a car accident and while I was bleeding out I told my crush best friend I love her. She's in a 10 year relationship and I haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.



EDIT: GOD GUYS THIS BLEW UP SO MUCH!!! I only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!

So I spoke to her... Over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. I decided that the best thing I could do at this point was just tell her the truth. I didn't expect anything and I didn't want anything to come out of it, but I just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. I would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but I guess life is just different from movies...

I told her how I felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. But I also added, and it's true, that I've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. I don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as I want her happy. I think she understood where I came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. I hope nothing will change with her because I love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. So I guess I just have to give you the boring response... But it's reality so sorry if it sucks... Im okay with though, I really didn't expect anything and still kind of think I was being selfish. We talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! She said she'll try and make the trip, even though I told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... She was really flattered though I think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing I thought about when I thought I was going to die"
afflns,TIFU by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.,34492,0.85,3831,2019-01-13 09:35:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/afflns/tifu_by_walking_in_on_my_teenaged_son_masterbating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/afflns/tifu_by_walking_in_on_my_teenaged_son_masterbating/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This just happened and I am still wishing it didn’t.   My  15 year old son and I are home, I’m working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing Fortnite.   He disappears for a little while and I go to find him.    I didn’t really need him for anything, just wanted to say ‘hi’ since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

I start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn’t super big and I knew he was in there.   The lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but I could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

I decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   He was lying with his back to me, I could tell by where his phone was.   As I am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, I see it.   My son’s boner.   As I was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   It all happened so fast and I was already airborne before I realized what was happening.   I did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son’s boner through his boxer briefs.   

The entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, I’m sure.   I have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, AND I DON’T WANT TO.

At that point, I am still flopped down on his bed.   Both of us are well aware that I just saw him whacking off.    Both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   I say, ‘Dinner is almost ready.’   (It wasn’t)
He said, ‘Ok, I’ll be out in a minute.’
I said, ‘No hurry.’

Now I’m standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he’ll need if he ever finds out I posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering WHY DON’T BOYS CLOSE THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE MASTURBATING?  

tl/dr:   Basically the title.     

Edit: spelling.   Dammit, I can’t change the spelling of ‘masturbating’ in the title.   Oh well.   I fixed ‘Fortnite’ though.   

Edit 2:  for those asking:

—I am mom.
—I want to be clear, I have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   I am a nurse.   I talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   The horrifying part is that I walked in on him.   That was not ideal.  For either one of us.  
—his door was OPEN.  
—I have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before I walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn’t on any social media.   I am quite confident that his identity is protected.

Edit 3:   For anyone still interested...

THANK YOU (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and I lessons about boundaries and privacy.    

WOW.   I now know what ‘RIP my inbox’ feels like.   I had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.

For those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.

And an update:   There is no weirdness.   We went straight back to the status quo, had dinner and just continued about our night.   I didn’t act weird and neither did he.   "

I work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


I had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled ""sexy pikachu"". Found [the one](https://www.deviantart.com/nancher/art/Pikachu-sexy-version-159235080), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.


I quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client's computer. You changed their background, not mine.""


I shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she's the owner's daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. He's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


I stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say ""Ok, send her over to me."" I'm a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it's really best I talk to her.


I answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what's going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""Hey, I'm locking my computer for you"" or ""Hey, I'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


TL;DR Tried to change coworker's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager.

She is normally very timid and self conscious about her body despite being in great shape (her body returned to Pre-baby weight almost immediately) and being a beautiful woman. 

The other night I hopped on my computer and browsed the internet in the evening as my wife fed the baby and put her to sleep. She came out in the living room asked what I was up to, I told her not much just gonna play a game or two with some friends. She said that sounded fun and then started tidying up a little. My attention then turned to my game with my friends. The lights were very dim in the room and I had headphones on. I hear a noise just slightly above the noise in my ears and look over my shoulder to see my wife sitting on the couch in the dimly lit room. “You’re sneaky I didn’t hear you come in” I say. She says yeah I guess. I then turn back to the game about to begin. 
 
Halfway though the match my phone lights up with a text from my wife. “Glad to know what you really think!” I had no clue what she was talking about. I fire off a “Huh?” Text. I quickly get up to go see what she’s talking about. I find her curled up in bed sobbing. I climb up next her and ask her what’s wrong and what the text meant. “ you know exactly what I mean”. I still have no clue as to what’s going on. After a little bit more probing  she tells me through tears, “ I wanted to have a fun evening with you. I put on lingerie and laid out all the  stuff for sex (towel, lubes, etc...), I come out to couch all dressed up and you look right at me and go right back to your game. “

I honestly was shocked by all of this. The monitor was super bright and I could all but make out the silhouette of her when she came out. I tried to explain that to her but honestly what could I say in that moment. Finally convinced her that I could not see anything when she came out. She was still frustrated and a little sad but now I’m slowly making my way out of the doghouse. 

TLDR
Couldn’t see wife come in and try seduce me and turned around  and started playing video games with my friends"

This just happened a few minutes ago. I was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. I had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. He was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. I was feeling pretty generous at that time so I got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because I was curious how far he would venture in. You know, normal pet owner stuff. He got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. I'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

TL;DR: My cat sneezed directly in my mouth."

This is an old story, but then again I'm an old man.

About 30-some odd years ago, when I was in my early 20's, I worked for a newspaper as the assistant district manager. One part of my job that I was doing then was to go around and make sure that the paperboys (remember them) picked up their delivered bundles of newspapers for delivery.

This was on a Sunday morning and I had to drive around to all the drop-off spots. And there it was...a bundle of newspapers still sitting out undelivered. I looked in my little booklet of paperboys and saw the name and address of the boy who was supposed to get them. No issue. He probably overslept and I just needed to wake him up.

I went to the house and knocked on the door. A woman in her 40's answered the door.

Me: ""Hi. Is Paperboy there? He hasn't picked up his newspapers and they need to go out!""

The woman then solemnly looked me in the eye. The 16-year old boy who I was asking about had hung himself in his own closet the previous day and was gone. She was a neighbor who was staying with the family to help them.

I felt about 1 inch tall.

I don't remember what exactly I said to her, but I apologized for the interruption and waking everyone, gave my intense sympathy to her, and backed away with my tail between my legs. I then contacted my boss for a copy of the customer list and delivered those newspapers myself for the next few days.

It was awful!

I know that I had no way of knowing, but I defy anyone who has something like that happen not to feel like the cosmos should have presented us with divine knowledge to not get into this!!! I didn't stay in that position for too much longer.

TL;DR Tried to wake up a paperboy only to find he died; tried to apologize my way out"
a01t86,TIFU by plagiarizing from my OWN Reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my University,34338,0.91,1845,2018-11-25 01:46:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a01t86/tifu_by_plagiarizing_from_my_own_reddit_post_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a01t86/tifu_by_plagiarizing_from_my_own_reddit_post_and/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"***Background***

I am a very passionate writer. I *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. Every week I would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***Story Time***

Last year, on r/WritingPrompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. I forget the full details, but it intrigued me and I wrote a 6-PAGE STORY about it. Anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but I still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that Reddit post.

**^((It was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***Present*** 

So a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. So I was like, okay sweet I don't need to spend any time on this project. I went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. To be sure I don't get into any trouble, I delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

Yesterday, I get an email from the Professor saying I need to meet with the Dean immediately. At this point, I am shitting my pants. She told me that I stole someone else's work and I could be withdrawn from my program. I try to explain but I have no proof that it was my work because I no longer live at home and I wrote it on an old laptop. I have a meeting with the head of the University later today. I am so fucking scared. I am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I copied and pasted my own work from my own Reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. Could be withdrawn from my program


Edit 1: [17:00] I found my original work. Took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. Travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. I’m okay with taking a zero, obviously, I just hope they can reason. 

Also, I can’t show the Reddit emails because I never had a real email for the account. 

Edit 2: SUCCESS! I brought my old laptop to the University principal and provided proof that I was the one to write the story. They were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what I told them before. They asked me why I did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. I told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*Results*

I am not kicked out, and I am actually given another chance at the project. My professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


Thanks everyone who supported me through this! I won’t do this again. I’m sorry. 


Also, thanks u/SQUID_FUCKER for the suggestion

> Just read all the edits.  You know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  If the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.


Maybe this will be the plot of the new story. "

Being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly Austrian and German people passing our table. We’ve been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

I was joking with the kids  that I’d left their Nintendo Switch at home, they suspected I was joking but went along with it anyway. So when I told them I had brought it they wanted to check.

“I brought it,” I said 

“Our Switch?”

“Yes, Our Switch”

“What?!! OUR Switch?!”

“Yes!! OUR Switch!!”

They got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. I noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn’t really register.

“OUR SWITCH?”

“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”

Then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - I was like “it’s ok... it’s a buffet”

“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”

“OUR SWITCH!”

Then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered “it sounds like you are all shouting Auschwitz”

My whole body went cold with the realisation.

Needless to say I immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son’s knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before I could stop him... 

I have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

TLDR: Shouted “Auschwitz” loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of Germans and Austrians. I’m really sorry.

EDIT: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! My first. To those calling BS: I wish it was. To the genial Germans and Austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - I will sleep better tonight because of you. And for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it’s a kinderhotel. Kind of like if Michael Bay did buffets.

EDIT2: just to all my salty comrades telling me I’m a “scum cunt”, that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. I fucking love you Reddit! I’m reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. You wouldn’t like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. It’s like a school playground where they’ve all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. Our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn’t walking past our table.."

After running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... Zaaap.  

I explained to him that he’s got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a “shock”.  My son looks at me and says “Like Pikachu?”

A bit of background.  A few months ago I discovered that Disney Now has the full run of all Pokemon episodes.  Like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  My son and I have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  My wife and I decided to get a Switch as a family gift for Christmas, along with Let’s Go Pikachu.  For my son’s birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a Pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

So a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his Pikachu plushie.  Drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing Frostpunk and says “Donder Shok!!” while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

As he runs away, clutching his plushie, all I can say to my wife was “I think Pikachu’s been teaching him some tricks”.  She was not amused.  



TL;DR - Pikachu taught my son Thunder Shock.  My wife is not happy about this development.  


Edit:  My first gold!  Thank you kind stranger!

Edit 2:  I know this may be more cute than traditionally TIFU, but I’m rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn’t too pleased at the time.   I know she’ll be laughing about it in a day or two with the rest of us (I hope).

If you don't know, pre-workout is a highly caffeinated powder that looks like [this](https://www.gnc.com/energy-supplements/548701.html?mrkgadid=&mrkgcl=1098&mrkgen=&mrkgbflag=&mrkgcat=&acctid=21700000001526007&&dskeywordid=92700057937791656&lid=92700057937791656&ds_s_kwgid=58700006417899872&ds_s_inventory_feed_id=97700000003618928&dsproductgroupid=317461650145&product_id=548701&merchid=1418768&prodctry=US&prodlang=en&channel=online&storeid=%7bproduct_store_id%7d&device=c&network=u&matchtype=&locationid=%7bloc_phyiscal_ms%7d&creative=472640341132&targetid=pla-317461650145&campaignid=11357099411&adgroupid=111332759517&gclid=Cj0KCQjwub-HBhCyARIsAPctr7xq0FaOOCDlqClCWHYJkf5jCG35QLyji4sCHNhBpuY-7oHh7jK2s8EaAh8xEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).

People often take it before workouts (like I always have) to give them the motivation they need.

Anwyways, I took 1.5 scoops as I normally do and went outside for a run on a particularly hot day.

At the end of the run, I felt weak and my chest was clenching with pain. 

Upon arriving at the gas station to get a Gatorade, I realized something wasn't right. I stumbled inside and grabbed the shirt of an attendant to say ""Please stay with me. I don't think I'm okay"".

My body was shaking, my vision narrowed, and the pain grew nearer. 

They gave me some water and talked with me to calm me down. Eventually, I felt well enough to go to my parent's house while my girlfriend was away just to be around someone. 

&#x200B;

**Going to the Hosptial:**

  
After half an hour at my parent's, nothing was better and I realized **I may actually be dying**. 

My heart rate had NOT slowed down, my breath was shortening, and my chest felt like it was collapsing. I calmly looked at my mother and suggested ""Alright, I believe now is the time we go to the Emergency Room""

We pull up to the ER and I stumbled inside the same way you would if you were drunk.

I politely tell the receptionist ""I need to be seen in some short while, as I am having what must be a heart attack"".

She hands me a form to fill out, which I make it about a third of the way through. My mind isn't cooperating and I have no strength to write anything down. The portion where it asks for my name was chicken scratch, and I could not for the life of me remember my birthday. 

She motioned someone to come collect me from the back urgently but I was too embarrassed to go with them without having properly filled out a simple form. 

""No, no! Let me fill out another one.""

They waited kindly with worried looks until I dropped the pen and said ""well we will just have to do this later"".

&#x200B;

**In The ER**

  
When I get back to the ER I am writhing in pain. Nothing is lowering my heart rate. Some punk comes in asking if I would like to pay all-at-once for a discounted price or on a monthly basis. I ask him if we can ""please consider these things later. 

About two hours pass and a few injections of something or another later, they tell me I’m fine but I have a fairly rare heart condition called [Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/), which had been excited by the stimulants and could have ended very poorly. 

I had taken pre-workout my entire life and had never known how close I always was to death. 

The doctor explained, until my surgery, every time I take stimulants like that I am flipping a coin on my life. 

So, while I am an unusual case, I encourage everyone to reconsider taking such supplements and to not be so concerned with properly filling out the welcome form when going to the ER.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: took pre-workout, went on a run, went to the ER, found out I have WPW and may have died of sudden cardiac arrest if I wasn't treated"

So last Friday, some of us teachers were sent a text from our Principal to sign some papers in our email. She likes to make sure everyone responds so she'll message people individually after a while.
I have a Saturday job as well so I don't check it until I get home. 
Well, on my way home I decided to stop by my dealer and bought some OG Cookies. They smelled so good that I texted my Fiancee to tell her what I got.
Well, when I get home I asked her if she was ready to try the stuff I got. She was confused as to what I was talking about because she was asking for the name of it and how it smells. I told her that I texted the info before I got home.
I checked my phone to see if it sent at all but I discovered that I opened up the wrong text. I had told my Principal/Boss that I had bought some stinky bud and to get our pipe and grinder ready.
She replied back saying ""No thanks but have a good weekend"" and she left a winky face emoji.
I've since talked to her only about work things. Nothing about this weekend had come up but I'm still kind of freaking out.

Edit: I've worked with this school district for 5 years. They don't do drug testing. I've known a few teachers from previous districts that used to partake. I live in CA. The Principal and I have been on good grounds since I've started. 

Tl:dr- Text my boss instead of my fiancee to tell them I had bought weed."

I have been working on a cruise ship for the past 5 months. When you live with, work with, eat with, and do everything else with the same people every day for months at a time you tend to get pretty close to them. I was the bass player in a cruise ship band quickly made friends with the drummer, from Brazil. This was my first time working on a cruise ship and this has been a goal of mine since I was just a wee lad. 10 days from the end of my contract me and my drummer friend decided to go out in port and have ourselves a memorable day. Too many beers later it was time to get back to the ship. We, being crew, have a sharp deadline for getting back to the ship. The problem was we, in our drunken stupor, got a little too far from the ship. My friend and I made it back to the port with about 5 minutes to spare but that wasn't enough time to make it through customs and back to the ship. Of the two of us, I had more to drink. Therefore I was the one who had the genius idea to hop the fence and make a dash for the ship. Well the customs officials had a different view on how good an idea that was. The two of us hopped the fence and immediately got busted. The ensuing police debacle not only got us in trouble, but held up the entire cruise ship. The Captain came down onshore and scolded us before firing us on the spot. When you're fired off a cruise ship... You're fired. There and then. They packed our bags for us and threw them on shore as the ship left port. Fortunately I am an American citizen so the consequences for me were to buy my own flight home, but my best friend was handcuffed and escorted to the airport where he was sent home and told never to return. 10 days left... And I fucked it up. 

TL;DR I convinced my friend to break international immigration law because we were running a few minutes late and now he can never come back"
7w5x3z,TIFU by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.,34256,0.86,1986,2018-02-08 21:48:38,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7w5x3z/tifu_by_almost_murdering_my_friend_and_stopping_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7w5x3z/tifu_by_almost_murdering_my_friend_and_stopping_a/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. Now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. And just before Sillybands took over as chief Tween Pimp Currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". Basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. We would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and Paper Hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

Eventually, things got out of hand. It became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. Heists were performed on teacher's desks. Books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. Students presented welts from Paper Hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. Rubber bands were contraband. It was a full-on Mad Max Magic School Bus adventure.

Here's where the fuckup started. One night, I was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: The secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. Spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. I needed something aerodynamic. So, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""I'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" I thought to myself.

Let me tell you.

The next day, I created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. With the inkwell loaded, I felt like a small, sexually frustrated MacGyver with intent to kill. On the bus, my friend (let's call him Neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. I obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. Neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). I aimed, pulled back and fired. All I saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before I heard an extremely sudden *crack*. I looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from Neo's head.

My parents had to pay for the window. Neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until Senior Year. The principal cracked down on Locker Artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

But I still won that arms race.

TL;DR: Sixth Grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. I upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. I was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

Thank you to the anonymous redditors that gave me my first silver and platinum, you are so awesome!

Naturally, this did not happen today...
Tl;dr is at the bottom.

About a week ago, I was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. We had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. So we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

We got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. Then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). Our kids loved it!

As we were leaving, I saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

Then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" Which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

I tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. I thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

I was wrong.

Now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""Nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""Nice butt mama""

""Nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

I don't think we will be leaving the house today...

TL;DR I set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt."

Back story i had a GF of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not ""recycle"" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. I thought it was stolen or lost. It had been missing for close to 3 years. 

So what happened. In the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. Simple enough i thought. 

Now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. This is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. Not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

Seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

And thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way Oh My God no fucking way. At this point im like wtf was that about. When i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

LIGHT BULB she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. 

Hour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.

Good to know it wasent a flat out no!

So back in June, as I'm sure you all remember, it had been a few months since any store in my area had been able to stock toilet paper of any kind. This was the kind of thing that was a big deal to most people, but not me. I had a plan. A secret trick up my sleeve that gave me an advantage over everybody else: Amazon. That's right, while these suckers were wrestling over individual rolls like Black Friday shoppers, I would be sipping cocoa on my couch and getting it all delivered right to my door.

Now, I had actually stocked up on TP toward the beginning of the lockdown. However, I did not have any flushable wipes, and I was able to find a box of eight individual packs of Cottonelle Flushable Wipes for a pretty good price. I popped them in my cart, clicked ""buy now,"" and I never had to leave the couch. Win-win, right?

A few weeks, maybe a month, after the wipes arrived and I began using them, I started noticing… a tingle. But not a pleasant tingle, more of an itch. A very very distracting itch. Like, an insanely overwhelmingly frustrating itch that will absolutely not go away unless I sit on the business end of a belt sander. Not something that is easy to deal with when you're standing in line at the bank. I had to fight my hand from instinctively twitching toward my agonizing butthole with every itchy pang, it must have looked like the drugs I had keistered were slipping out.

As luck would have it, right around the time I began experience symptoms, I was laid off due to COVID. My healthcare was employer-provided, and while I now know that they are continuing my coverage for a few more months, the whole layoff was pretty sudden and at the time I had no idea where my healthcare coverage stood. Furthermore, I didn't feel like an itchy asshole was a great reason to go to the hospital during an ongoing pandemic when 1. I don't want to catch COVID; second, I assumed I had just developed some kind of sensitivity to the chemicals in the wipes that would go away on its own; and C. I feel like every doctor in the country has more important things to do right now than look at my asshole. So, rather than seek the advice of a medical professional, I decided to just not do anything about it and hope it would go away. Smart right?

Fast forward to today. Four months after I purchased the wipes. Butthole as itchy as ever. Seriously considering seeking medical help at this point. I wake up in the middle of the night in great discomfort, and check my phone to see the time. 4 AM. I also have an email from Amazon about a recent order I placed. I open the email, and it reads as follows:

>Greetings from Amazon.  
>  
>We have recently learned of a potential safety issue regarding the following product that our records indicate you purchased from Amazon:  
>  
>Cottonelle FreshFeel Flushable Wet Wipes for Adults, 8 Flip-Top Packs, 42 Wipes per Pack (336 Wipes Total)  
>  
>**Cottonelle has informed us that the product might contain bacterium, Pluralibacter gergoviae, which was detected during product testing.** More details, including how to determine if your purchase is impacted and what you should do next can be found in the following notification:

>[https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq](https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq)

This was an option I had legitimately never considered until I got this message. The very thing I had purchased to clean bacteria off of my ass had **contaminated my ass with bacteria.** I feel so betrayed. Also, super gross. Super, super gross. Time to go to the doctor.

TL;DR – Bought flushable wipes so my butt would be clean. Wipes made butt angry. Months later, I find out that the wipes were contaminated with bacteria, and I might as well have been wiping my ass with leaves from the yard, and now I need medical attention. Cool.

EDIT: please for christ's sake don't spend money on reddit awards for my butthole, if you want to make me feel better [donate to Jaime Harrison](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_harrison_fr_homepage_2019?refcode=MS_HP_FR_X_X_homepage_X__F1_S1_C1__X&recurring=auto&amount=25) and kick Lindsey Graham the fuck out of the Senate

Also for those concerned, I do now have a bidet attachment, got one a month or so ago. At the time I bought the wipes, due to the societal TP freakout, bidets were out of stock too. Rest assured that no more wipes will be purchased.

I got a lot of requests to do an update so here it is! But first I just wanna say thank you to everyone who helped me see an embarrassing situation as something that would be a great story one day. I’m happy that the most horrifying moment of my life could make some of you guys smile. I also want to say thank you to those who said I ripped off that one Friends episode. I might be one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t watched Friends but I checked it out, and definitely laughed :) I was a little bummed out reading some of the comments about my boyfriend. I promise you all he’s a really great guy and he was just in so much shock that he didn’t react the best. I don’t really blame him though. Anyways… On to the update!

The night my in-laws walked in on me, they were supposed to stay for dinner and then go back to the hotel they were staying at. After I was ahem… caught in the act, my boyfriend and them left and went back to their hotel. He said it was a very quiet car ride. When he got back a few hours later, we got into a fight where he questioned my motives and accused me of purposely getting caught to prove a point. I denied it and the argument ended there. He slept on the couch that night. The next morning I woke up and he had made breakfast for us. He apologized to me and basically explained that he was so embarrassed and in shock that he didn’t know what to think. He said that he did appreciate the effort though, and that had his parents not been there with him, he “would’ve jumped” me. I apologized for surprising him at an inappropriate time and for not checking my phone. I then asked him what his parents thought about all of it. He told me that they weren’t angry at all and that they decided not to come for dinner because they didn’t want me to be uncomfortable and they thought it’d be best to give us the night to sort things out. He told me that they did intend to come for dinner tonight which I told him I didn’t think I was up for quite yet. He understood and called his mother to let her know. I didn’t hear much of the conversation but it ended up with him handing me the phone saying “She wants to talk to you.” As soon as I got the phone I started profusely apologizing and telling her that it wasn’t my intention for them to see that. She just laughed and said “I imagine it wasn’t” and said that embarrassing things happen, especially in front of family and that they would never hold something like that against me. But that I would never live it down. She then proceeded to tell me of the many times my boyfriend and his brother had walked in on them doing the dirty. Which was uncomfortable but kinda comforting. She then said that she and her husband were really looking forward to dinner and wondered if I’d reconsider. I realized that I was going to have to see them at some point and that it would be shitty of me to not have them over after they drove all this way to see us. So I agreed. They came over, it was awkward. But after a few jokes about if the couch was steamed cleaned and if the adult movie I was watching was included in our cable package, everything went really well!

TL:DR Boyfriend apologized, parents don’t hate me.

Edit: title typo. It's Bop It. Two words.

One thing I LOVE to do after a long day of work is sitting my butt down infront of my monitor, ripping a joint, and playing Xbox with some friends.

Long story short that's exactly what I did. I got super high, was playing games with my friends when Bop It got brought up in conversation. So, my high ass turns to my girlfriend on the couch next to me and signed (without speaking) ""Did you ever play Bop It growing up?"" My girlfriend so innocently just signs back ""wtf is that?""
Edit: for those that don't know, Bop It is a speed and coordination toy from the mid 90s that requires hearing to play.

Guys, it took me a good 20-30 seconds before I realized what I just asked my 100% DEAF girlfriend of 2 YEARS. The shame I felt. 

Anyway, I told the boys online, everyone had a solid laugh including my hellova good sport girlfriend. 

TL;DR I got high while playing video games w/friends when Bop-it was brought up in convo. Asked my born deaf gf of 2 years if she'd ever played it. Surprisingly enough no she had not, and I felt incredibly stupid."

I consider myself of average intelligence, average looks, average sense of humor, average dick size.

Really the only other dicks I've seen are a) in porn, and b) a couple of buddies on a skinny dipping night.  In all cases I'm smaller.  I already know some comments are gonna be all ""But what about in the locker room?"" what locker rooms are you in that everyone is running around balls out naked?  My gym has individual showers and change areas, there's very occasionally someone getting changed in the common area, but I'm not staring at their junk, and yeah, every so often I see someone smaller than me, but that reinforced my viewpoint that I'm extremely average.  Okay, back to the story.

Recently I got divorced, I had been with my ex wife for 16 years.  She was my first, and the only woman I'd ever been with.  Whenever we used condoms I'd always dread it.  I mean, all guys say the same thing about them right?  There's no feeling, difficult staying hard, everyone hates condoms.  I just assumed that was the universal truth, and it never occurred to me to investigate further.  Every time I had to put one on I'd start to go flaccid, apologize, and work really hard to perform.  Sex was bad, often way more work than it was worth.

Well, recently I met a woman on Tinder.  She has more experience than I do.  Before meeting she asked about my size and I answered honestly, I'm super average.  She said that's cool, and we went on a date.  At the end of it we hooked up, and there I am trying to put on a condom, same thing as usual happening, struggling to roll it down, starting to go flaccid, getting embarrassed, when she points out that apparently I'm incorrect, not average, and am wearing the wrong sized condoms.  I wrote it off, I thought she was just being polite and trying to give me an ego boost to help be not feel so bad.  At our next encounter she handed me a larger condom.  Holy fucking shit.  What the fuck.  I no longer feel like I'm about to be swung into battle by an enraged Gimli.

Yes, I recognize the humble brag, but what a fucking waste of 16 years.  I'm more pissed about that, then I am 'happy' about my dick size.  I'm elated about this problem being fixed, and want to jump for joy and tell my friends, but who can I possibly tell without sounding like a giant bragging douche?  Nobody, so instead I'm telling you, I'm fine with sounding like a douche to you.

TL;DR - Wasted 16 years having terrible sex cause I was wearing condoms that were too small.

&#x200B;

edit - A lot of people are reading this as though I'd never had sex without a condom, which isn't the case.  My ex wife was on and off birth control for a myriad of reasons.  When she was on all was good, when she was off I was in a frequent battle with the Scranton Strangler."

A bit of backstory, my wife and I have been working the entire time during quarantine so we were able to keep some semblance of normality in our lives. She works for a website development company writing code and such. I'm an essential worker, with bright and early days and a 21:00ish bedtime.

Cue about 3 months ago, her boss issues ""Crunch"" for all devs. She has been working 10 to 14 hour days Monday - Friday. Naturally, she has been hard at work and our personal lives took a bit of a step back. We would still do things together during the weekends, but not as often.

On to last night, we were watching a bit of some bullshit show on Netflix. It was really boring so we went right to the ""chill"" part of things. And this is were things took a wrong turn.

Horny brained me decided it would be a fantastic idea to tickle my dangerously ticklish wife (horny brained me is an idiot), so I tickled. She yelped and (deservedly and unintentionally) headbutted me right across the face. As I'm laughing and holding my face, I notice she went pale. I look at my hands, blood. So I head to the washroom.

As I'm cleaning my face I notice my lip is slightly lower than it should be so I turn it inside out to find a gaping hole near my two front teeth. So off to the emergency room we go.

Shamefully explain to the attending what happened. She laughs. I get 2 stitches inside my mouth and am told to not eat anything hot or solid for the next 24 hours.

When we get home she looks at me and says: ""You still horny?"". Me: ""Yup"". Good times...

TL;DR: Horny brained me tickled my wife. Ended up with stitches in my mouth.

Edit: Spelling.

Edit 2: Thanks for all the awards and upvotes! Y'all are amazing!

Edit 3: Some people asked what was the show. I'm not sure on the English name since the show is in Turkish. Translating it directly from my native language it would mean ""The Guardian"". Hope that helps!

Edit 4: Thanks again everyone! Did not expect this post to blowup the way it did! "
lkqu9d,TIFU by trusting a stranger and letting him change my tire for me.,34034,0.94,1915,2021-02-16 05:31:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lkqu9d/tifu_by_trusting_a_stranger_and_letting_him/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lkqu9d/tifu_by_trusting_a_stranger_and_letting_him/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"TIFU, that actually happened about 2 weeks ago. I needed to run into Walmart really quick on a Saturday. It's always busy on weekends so I parked pretty far away and decided to walk instead of try to find a close parking spot. I'm a female in my 20's, I was by myself. I ran in, grabbed what I needed and was out within about 20 minutes.


When I walked out to my car I got in and a male in his mid-30s knocked on my window and let me know that my tire was flat.


I got the creeps because I've heard plenty or horror stories of weird ways guys lure women out and grab them, but I wanted to check. I keep mace on my car keys so I made it obvious that I was holding my mace as I did. Sure enough my rear passenger tire was completely flat to the rim. He offered to help me change it, I said it was okay, that I would call AAA but he offered again and he seemed nice enough, so I accepted and said thank you.


As he was changing my tire, he told me he saw me in Walmart and then asked me a lot of questions like how old I was and if I had plans, a boyfriend, and so on. I deflected most of them but I did tell him I had a bf and that my friends were expecting me. I noticed he had a gas can towards the front of what I assume was his car.  I asked if he ran out of gas and he said yes but he forgot his wallet at home. (Now looking back, I'm wondering why he'd be in Walmart without a wallet).


It seemed like he was fishing for me to offer to give him a ride which of course I would never do. But I did give him a little money towards gas and he insisted on trying to get my information so we could meet up and he could pay me back. I said no thank you, a good deed for a good deed and I left it at that. As soon as my tire was done I got in the car and left.


When the tire shop opened during the week, I went to get my tire fixed thinking it was simply a flat, but it turns out there were three intentional stab marks in the sidewall of my tire.


I'm pretty sure this was not a coincidence and I think having my mace, keeping my distance, and saying people were expecting me saved me from something very terrible. I normally avoid Walmart at night, but this was broad daylight. 


TL;DR: TIFU by trusting a strange man to change my tire, when it turns out he was the one that stabbed my tire and was probably going to try something shady if I had been more naive. For all the ladies reading this, don't be naive, stay in your car and call AAA.



EDIT/UPDATE!!! 

I feel like I'm at an award show! Thank you kind strangers for all of the love and awards, I'm overwhelmed with how much attention this post got! I tried reading through most comments but I'm going to address the most common replied here.



I felt like TIFU was an appropriate thread because I feel like I was too nice and didn't want to offend the guy, I'm not going to ever feel that way again!



I went to the police today, the officer I spoke with said something similar has recently been reported at this particular Walmart so he is sending my info and description to the seargent of the precinct in charge of that area. I should be expecting a call from him. 



Mace=pepper spray. I should definitely look into the legality of carrying a midevil mace though 😜



I actually do know how to change my tire, put on chains, check my oil etc. I even have changed my own alternator and brake pads! This particular day I was in a hurry and already ready to go see my friends so I didn't want to get dirty. I have roadside assistance, so I figured I might as well use that.



To the people saying this is fake, I really wish it did not happen. There is no point in lying to all of reddit, I simply wanted to share my story because I really feel that had I been more naive, I might not be here today. I was going to post a pic of my tire but I don't think I can since I didn't post this as a picture type of post."

Today I had a day off to get on with some house stuff whilst wifey is at work and the kids are at school. I zoomed through the chores so I could spend a couple of quality hours on my hobby.


My hobby is model painting and for my recent 40th my amazing wifey got me an air brush and a compressor to run it. I tootled around with it for a while before realising that the air brush and compressor were different makes so I needed an adaptor to make them work together. I found one online and duly purchased it.


Just a short while later I received an angry call from my wifey wanting to know why I was looking at niche porn  when tonight is date night. She was quite upset and asked why when she went on Google during her lunch, the most recent searches were for ""1/2 inch female nipples"", ""nipple enhancers"" and ""hose extensions"".


""You see honey, the screw on part that sticks out the compressor is called a nipple and it's only 1/4"" when I have a 1/2"" airhose to attach to it so I need a half inch female nipple adapter to connect the two... Yes that is a silly name... no, your nipples are perfect...yes I'm sure, I love you too.""

UPDATES: just to answer the regular questions. 

I was painting models from the fellowship of the ring and finishing their bases off. 

No, my wifey has no issue with me looking at porn. She just was concerned I was looking at something to do with nipple resizing and that I only liked a specific type of nipple. She got self conscious and worried so phoned me in an angry and upset panic. 

Yes my wifey is self conscious about herself. Show me a part of a lady we guys don't sexualise and you'll finally have found the part of a woman's body that they don't have hang ups about. 

No she wasn't snooping through my search history, Google just brings up our last 5 or so things we searched. 

Yes I know there are other ways to share calendars and the like. I'm 40 so not interested in learning new apps or functions, this works for me and that is fine. 

For those who felt calling my wife by her nickname was cringy, that's something I really hadn't considered before. Now that you've made me see it in that light I can realise I should have wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey. 

Date night is my idea. Since I work shifts I make sure and put aside time just for the two of us, it's one day every 3 weeks. 

Date night was great, thanks for the well wishes. We played a couch coop game on the console for 8 hours, chuckled together at the comments and got a ruler out as one of the comments suggested. Twas a fun and precisely measured evening for all. 

TL;DR the correct technical term for the metal coupling adaptor I needed for a compresser was a 1/2 inch female nipple, leading to Google search confusion."

Before this happened I was unaware incognito mode on Chrome was a thing. Because of this every time I would go to a certain NSFW website I would type the link into a Discord (basically the new Skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. I only send the links to him while it said he is offline. I did this so my Chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website I decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. I would then click on the link of the website through Discord and delete the message. Little did I know that my friend has Discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. He basically had an alert for every time I masturbated.

So after I had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these NSFW links in the middle of the day. I start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. I told him about the whole process I go through just to get to a website. After that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on Chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. After more laughing we moved on.  

I'm glad to know about incognito mode though I will probably keep doing it has I have been because I'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


TL;DR: I have been sending NSFW links to my friend on Discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. He has Discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time I masturbate ."

So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I'll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I'll rest for 3 minutes. I'll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I'm feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. ""I can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". So I go and I'm feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I'm feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I'm struggling. Like I'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but I'm going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I'm seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. Lecture still sucked after that. 

TL;DR Tried going for Olympic gold in breath holding. Failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall.

Last week my (24F) boyfriend (28M) and I got into an argument about which one of us puts in the most effort to keep things adventurous sexually. He argued that 90% of the time, it’s him. I told him that I didn’t think that was true and he responded that not once in the 3 years we’ve been together, have I ever caught him off guard sexually. I told him that he was gonna eat his words and the next time I proposed sex, it would be a surprise. 

Now, I knew that he was going to be expecting something after that so I decided today would be the best day to do it. The reason being was that his parents were coming to visit from out of town and when they do, I’m way too stressed out to even think of sex so I knew he wouldn’t be expecting anything. He told me that he would be home from work at 4 and they would be arriving at 7ish. Perfect, that would give us some time to do the deed, clean up, and then have ourselves a little secret for when the in-laws visit. So I set myself up on the living room couch (which was a clear view from the door) wearing only a pair of heels. I decided to put some porn on the TV (which I never typically watch) and touch myself to it so when he came in he would surely be surprised. I had my head tipped back when the door opened and all I heard were gasps. I looked up and stood there was my boyfriend and his parents. I flipped over and scrambled for a blanket to cover myself and heard the door slam. I checked my phone and saw that my boyfriend had texted me that his parents had left earlier to avoid traffic. He came home a few hours later and was extremely angry and is convinced I did this to get back at him for saying I don’t try hard enough. Dinner with the in-laws is going to be a bit awkward. 

TL;DR Boyfriend said I don't surprise him enough. Decided to surprise him naked, watching porn, and playing with myself in the living room. He walked in and was surprised... and so were his parents who arrived with him."

He sleeps in while I shower and get ready, then a morning walk, then he naps while I work, lunch together, we use a leash but it’s superfluous, so on and so on.

The most “protest” I get from him is when I want to snuggle, he doesn’t, and he’ll crawl closer inch by inch until I leave him alone.

We also have a fenced in backyard and a dog door, so he has free reign of the house and backyard. Most days.

Today we have a repair guy working in the backyard, so Camden has to stay inside. He hasn’t complained at all and asked only once to go out to pee. And this is where I fucked up.

He watched the repair guy for a second, he peed, and then he watched the repair guy again. I assumed that meant he was done, so I called him inside. And the little bastard hestitated. I assumed he just wanted to be outside longer so I called him again and he trotted back in like the best damn dog he is. 

Then he shit in the middle of the floor.

TL;DR: My dog loves me so much he shit on the floor instead of disobeying me.

My girlfriend and I met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. Since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. Yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. She was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. So expecting some good news, I took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and I arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that I now have to look in the same area as her. I totally lost my mind when she told me that. I explain that I understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that I had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. The situation then became very tense, she told me that I am selfish and that I have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. I then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because I really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. And that, guys, she took it really hard, I've never seen her so upset in my life. She then gave me an ultimatum: either I follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if I'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. Maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment I fucked up.

I still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer I could find was : ""Perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"". I could have made long rants to show her that I love her, that I care about her. I could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. But no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. She looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, I realized how much I fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. She just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. I sent her a very long message of apology, adding that I hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.

I am now staring my Thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.

&#x200B;

EDIT : Whoah, this blew up far more than I could imagine. I took time to read all your comments, and I spend a big part of my day speaking with my GF about the situation. So here's the situation : 1) She's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) She thinks (and she's not the only one from what I read) that I'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.

To clarify some things I'm living in a small country in Europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. Then I admit it, I may not be ready to start my professional life. In my head I'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my GF. For me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. That's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. Also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.

Today we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. For my GF, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. She told me that it would only be a matters of months. I explained my feelings and what I wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. We even reached an agreement : I will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. She also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  Now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.

Oh, I saw some people were wondering : when I left her house yesterday, I didn't take back the sushi

&#x200B;

TLDR : GF finds a job far away from our city and I doesn't want to leave my life to live this far. She asks me if I'm really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was ""Maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation""."

TL/DR below.

My (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

We had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

However, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)

On my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.

Here's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled

**""HEY LET ME IN!!""**

The entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

Now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said

**""GET ON THE GROUND!!!""**

There was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don't know. He did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.

The rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. There was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Became unaccounted for just as an Active School Shooter Drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

I recently had a baby, and in an effort to maximize time, I often pump for breastmilk while I'm driving. Earlier today I had to pick up a Target drive-up order just as I was finishing my pumping session.

I pulled into the parking spot and clicked the ""I'm here"" button in the app, figuring I'd have a few minutes to get pumping wrapped up and put away. I shouldn't have underestimated Target's customer service.

Within 20 seconds a pubescent teen boy was staring at me through my drivers seat window, mere inches from my milk splattered, grotesque postpartum breasts (which could probably more accurately be described as bazoongas). 

His face told an epic story only a seasoned author could conjure:   
1. Confusion.   
2. Skeptical confusion as he starred directly at my nipples being sucked into the transparent flanges like a profane cow  
3. Horror  
4. Massive embarrassment.  


I have a feeling he will be conjuring this story to a therapist someday.

TL:DR: I didn't get my pumping session wrapped up soon enough and flashed a teenage Target employee with my milk producing bazoongas."

I had eaten a burrito or two and was dropping some absolute bombs before falling asleep.  I only have about 8 hours between shifts so getting as much sleep as I can in there is pretty important.

Around 1am I was woken by the CO/Propane monitor beeping loudly which is something that is scary as hell of you've ever read about CO poisoning.  Well it had a propane indicator which for the life of me I couldn't figure out, I had taken the propane system out last week.  

I was crouched and had silenced the alarm when my body expelled another big wave of leftover burrito fume and as it hit the monitor it starting screaming for me to please god stop with the torture.  

Realizing my problem I cracked the windows and turned the fan on only to have it go two or three more times across the night, waking me and ruining my sleep for the night. 

I had a horrible smelly zombie day today and it was all due to my ass.  

TL;DR: I farted all night which set off the propane alarm and kept me from sleeping.

My wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It’s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

One of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

On this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.

Apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

My wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that’s fair.

I’m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.

TL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family.

81ywin,TIFU by fucking my dads couch,33784,0.9,1657,2018-03-04 22:35:32,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/81ywin/tifu_by_fucking_my_dads_couch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/81ywin/tifu_by_fucking_my_dads_couch/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"Throwaway, because I don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

This happened last week on Saturday, because Saturday and Sunday is my father's custody time for me. Saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

This made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. 
Materials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags

I started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. 

Another detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

Not today

He left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

I heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". I couldn't decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

TL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

EDIT: Typo

EDIT NO.2: HOLY SHIT YALL BLEW THIS UP.
I really, really, REALLY appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. My couch fucking earned me a dollar and I'm proud!"

So i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn’t put much thought into it.
Yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn’t stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

I took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
I cant believe i’ve went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn’t breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
Surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

TL;DR. i’m stupid and didn’t realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years."

I'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. I'm 21, I like Starbucks, I wear leather leggings and hoodies, I'm blonde, I have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy I'm sorta dating didn't believe me when I told him I've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. Instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. It kinda pissed me off he thought I'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so I figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

He kinda laughed at the idea but I made him accept.  

We got to the gym, I met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. The dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. There was no way I'm saying no to that. My plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that I've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. I got mad.  

We begin. He's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like I'm some kid-- and I'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. The cheering was the boiling point. As soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere I decided to head kick him with everything I had. I literally grunted as I kicked him. In the ten or so years I've been kickboxing I don't think I've EVER kicked anyone that hard. He was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

Needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that I've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- I also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the KO.  

Surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: My date didn't believe me I've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. I head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

&#x200B;

Edit; This kinda blew up and I can't reply to everyone! I know what I did is fucked up and bad and I realize how bad it'd look if the genders were reversed. I didn't post this to gloat and brag nor do I think he had it coming-- I thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. I didn't realize this would offend so many people.

Edit 2; Guys, I can't stress this enough- I posted this because I fucked up. He's fine and his coach took him to the hospital. I'm really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it's on me for writing it up like this. I hope someone reads the edits because I can't reply to every individual comment."

This weekend I was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and I made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. I had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""You know, it's extra sharp. It really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

And that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. I hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that I have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that I've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that I always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""What the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if THAT'S not what you're talking about?!""

I figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. I love spicy foods. I love sharp cheeses. I thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. Apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South-African American scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

TL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn’t realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

Edit: Though Cormack was born in South Africa, he became a US citizen early in his career. That's why he was on the list of African Americans."

So me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. We're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. Anyways, I'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, I end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. His family counts me as part of their own family.

So his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. It was one of those ""even when I'm sick and can't hang out, I still need help with word puzzles"" things. Classic couple. Well I take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. So I swipe up and I'm thinking of what it could be, when I realize the letters could spell out ""nudes."" Eventually, I send it off as ""nudes? lol"" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what I mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.

A few minutes later, I get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says ""oh my!!"" I think to myself, ""well that's weird, I haven't talked to her in forever"" so I open up Instagram. Turns out, while I had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, Instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. My heart immediately sunk. I realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. She said she understood, but at the very best she figures that I was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.

My wife went out with work friends tonight. I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I’m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I’m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here’s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, “Goodnight darling.” 

What followed was me doing what I’ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she’s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife’s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. 

So now I’m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I’d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don’t have the energy to fight tonight. There’s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.

TL;DR - Found out my wife’s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y’all are the best.

Update: Since I’ve been asked a few times I’ll try it on this thread. Idk if anyone will see if since it was taken down but oh well. I confronted her Sunday night. Eventually she admitted what I already knew. I assume there’s more I don’t know about. I got set up to start counseling next week. Broke down at the office today and left early to save myself the embarrassment of crying at work. Staying with at a friends while I figure out which way is up."
cc41qj,TIFU by realizing my History teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the Civil War.,33625,0.87,3502,2019-07-12 06:31:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cc41qj/tifu_by_realizing_my_history_teachers_gave_me_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cc41qj/tifu_by_realizing_my_history_teachers_gave_me_a/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I had 4 years of ROTC in high school and 2 Semesters of American History. (2 separate teachers) So, not a history major, but I have absorbed a lot of material on the Civil War. And I realized today that it was horseshit and I got hoodwinked.

Before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the Civil War happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". And that definitely was an issue. But my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. They gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the North, what Europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --There was a lot. And it made sense, because I found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. So they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. Again, super plausible. This was all being presented with an attitude of ""Now let me tell you what REALLY happened"". 

Im SIX semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the Declarations of Secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. I had no idea they existed. I read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. They were ALL about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. There's no way this wasn't THE forefront issue, after reading those papers. I messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, I wasn't. I told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the Secession declarations either. Ugh.

Reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong I was. I don't care about people calling me dumb, I'll own that. I just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and I got this...propaganda. I am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. I hope my stupidity is isolated, but I wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

TL;DR I thought the Civil War was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

EDIT: The FU part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the Reddit community about how completely stupid I was for me to learn about the documents, or the Cornerstone speech.

cpyzhi,TIFU by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store...,33622,0.93,1177,2019-08-14 02:04:15,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cpyzhi/tifu_by_basically_buying_a_serial_killer_starter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cpyzhi/tifu_by_basically_buying_a_serial_killer_starter/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.

Needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

While I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.

Walking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

Keep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.

Girl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

About half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

Then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

Her: ""Wow that's a big knife.""
Me: ""Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.""
Stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

Her: ""Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
Me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. 

She quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.

She says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.

She gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

I get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
I say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

I get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

I was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

Girl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

Told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

TL;DR: 
Bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer."
84a3oc,TIFU by accidentally committing theft as a Police Officer in full uniform.,33600,0.89,2883,2018-03-14 08:24:58,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/84a3oc/tifu_by_accidentally_committing_theft_as_a_police/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/84a3oc/tifu_by_accidentally_committing_theft_as_a_police/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. This happened a few weeks ago.

I woke up one morning at 5:00 A.M. tired as fuck. I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.

I started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST"". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

My vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

At about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said ""I need to talk to you at the department.""

Oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant's office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, ""Close the door"". At this point I knew this wasn't good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.

After a preface from my Sergeant, he says, ""Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

I didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito."" Then I just heard ""Guess what, that's theft.""

After a ""Come to Jesus"" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn't want to press charges.

Although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

On a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me ""The Burrito Burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.

Tl;dr: I'm a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it."
c6izh3,TIFU by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage,33573,0.83,2356,2019-06-28 16:50:16,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6izh3/tifu_by_blowing_my_load_absolutely_everywhere/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6izh3/tifu_by_blowing_my_load_absolutely_everywhere/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

I visited Thailand in September '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

One morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn't think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai.

I suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

This wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

The first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those ""I've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

Cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

Edit - Typos  


Edit 2 - After desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as I could, I received a notification that I'd hit the front page. So, I guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, I still need to work too. In all honesty, I wrote up this event because I had been told I had to during one of the many times I have regaled people with it. I had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so I posted it typos and all. I did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and I am grateful beyond words. Every little complement and giggle is doing more good than I think most people would realise. Thank you.

TL; DR - Got a massage whilst forgetting my underwear, ended up shooting my wad all over myself, a poor masseuse and her equipment in a furious display of penile theatrics."
gs7iy3,TIFU by doing a pelvic exam on a standardized patient during medical school,33518,0.91,1379,2020-05-28 20:14:14,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gs7iy3/tifu_by_doing_a_pelvic_exam_on_a_standardized/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gs7iy3/tifu_by_doing_a_pelvic_exam_on_a_standardized/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Throw away for obvious reasons.

I'll try to keep this short as there isn't much to say. Our medical school class has to do sensitive exams (pelvic, genital, rectal) toward the end of our second year, right before we are allowed to go into the hospital wards. The idea is that these people are paid to have the sensitive exams done, each person has 15-20 students examine them. The vast majority of the time the people getting the exams done are elderly or former healthcare workers who are comfortable with their bodies, want to help educate students, and make some money at the same time. The patient our group had was an uncharacteristically young woman, she was probably in her mid twenties. This shouldn't have been an issue at all, but my medical school class is very conservative, nearly half is already married and the other half is still waiting to have sex until marriage. At least three guys in my group had probably never seen a vagina, let alone touched one. This made the experience way more awkward than it had to be for the patient. Anyway, we do the exam, thank our patient for volunteering her time, and leave for the day.

Fast forward about 4 weeks to yesterday, I'm at the grocery store buying some oatmeal. And I see a young wman near the cereal. She looks familiar but I can't quite figure out where I've seen her before. I know with 100% certainty I've seen her, just not sure where. She looks at me and makes eye contact, not the polite eye contact you make, smile, and look away. The type of eye contact where it's prolonged, like she was also trying to figure out where she saw me. We both smile and I walk toward her. The exchange was basically this.

**Me:** ""Hey, you look super familiar, where have I seen you before?""

**Her:** ""I was thinking the same thing, I'm not sure. Are you from *insert city we're in.""*

**Me:** ""No, I'm just here for school.""

**Her:** ""Oh, I just graduated from *local univeristy.* What are you studying maybe we've had a class together.""

**Me:** ""Oh I don't go to *local university,* I'm a medical student at *different campus.""*

It was at that moment I realized I had fucked up. We both immediately stop smiling. We both instantly knew exactly where we had met before. I have no idea why, but instead of trying to diffuse the situation and acknowledge the humor in what just happened, my dumb-ass-awkward-self thought it was a good time to say ""wait a minute, this isn't the canned food isle."" And I just walked away.

God, please kill me and end my misery.

**TL;DR:** Examined someone's vagina in medical school, ran into her at the grocery store later. We both recognized each other but couldn't remember where from. While talking we both immediately figured it out.

&#x200B;

Edit: as u/squirrelybitch and u/azellnir pointed out I shouldn't have been so awkward about sex or the encounter in general. And I completely agree, society in general treats the human body as some taboo that shouldn't be talked about. The reason we were both so awkward was because as doctors we are trained to never initiate contact with our patients in public. If they are the first ones to recognize you, that's fine, you can say hello back, but we can never admit or even imply they are our patients. So just the whole situation where we were both completely caught off guard and didn't expect to have encountered each other in a clinical setting."

So I have been working hard to lose weight for a while as I refuse to simply allow myself to become diabetic without a fight

I have lost a grand total of 80lbs 

Mostly in up and down spurts

Well when you are overweight you get used to having a belly out in front of you

I used to use it to ""bump open"" doors and barge in with a ""boom baby!!"" Like in the emperor's new groove

Well last night I thought I hadn't done it in a while and my wife and daughter were both in my daughters room

I walk up to the door

Thrust forward with much force...

 about .2 seconds before realizing my stomach no longer protrudes past my manbits

I proceeded to smash my junk into the door and double over on the floor with a high pitched ""balls"" instead of boom baby

My wife and daughter are both just staring at me grabbing the manberries and wincing not sure if they should laugh or help

After rolling around on the floor for a bit and making all sorts of noises I'm sure I could not replicate if I tried

 they decided to laugh

TLDR: forgot I no longer had bulging belly, smashed balls into door."

So last night my girlfriend and I decided to go out to the bars. Got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. Recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. Well last night was the first time we decided to use them. We read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. Everything went well but afterwards we couldn’t find the plug. This is where the TIFU begins. 

We figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. Woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. GFs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she’s a little extra hungover no big deal. We arrive at McDs to get some greasy hangover food. I order while GF heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. As i take our order back to our table, GF walks over in a panic saying we need to leave NOW.

She found the butt plug. In our drunken state, we managed to put the ENTIRE thing in her ass. Handle and all. And now it’s sitting at the bottom of a McDonalds toilet in all its glory. 

Tl;dr: Did not use a butt plug as directed."

Halfway through, the sound stops, so I try turning up the volume with no success. As I’m trying to figure out why the sound stopped, I see the tiny earphone symbol in the corner of my screen. I quickly realize that my mom is getting ready for her morning walk and put the AirPods in her ears and heard my nice video... on full blast. 

Later that day she gave me back the AirPods and said she didn’t like them either.

10v7zzy,TIFU being intimate with a medium,33465,0.82,1998,2023-02-06 20:01:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10v7zzy/tifu_being_intimate_with_a_medium/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10v7zzy/tifu_being_intimate_with_a_medium/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,True,False,False,"Throwaway.

Last night I (28m) managed to convince an attractive girl (25) to come home with me. It was the end result of a successful first date. Well, successful-ish. As soon as the two of us were naked in bed, she froze and asked if I lost a loved one recently. That question caught me off guard because my face was buried between her legs at the time. I didn't answer at first, but she asked again. The second time she literally made me stop eating her out so I could respond. For the record, she did mention that she had a sixth sense when we were getting to know each other, but we never discussed it in detail. 

To answer her question, I said my grandma passed away not so long ago. My date nodded her head and said she sensed my grandma's presence. I said I didn't believe in ghosts and continued eating her out. My date said my grandma had a message for me. At that moment, I was doing everything I could in the pussy eating department to distract my date from talking about my dead grandmother, but sadly, my oral sex game did nothing to prevent her from telling me that grandma wanted me to forgive my brother. I stopped what I was doing and asked my date what she meant. A few years ago, my brother hooked up with my gf (now ex). I hated him afterwards and our relationship basically became nonexistent. I never shared that information with anyone, let alone with a girl I just met, but somehow she knew. 

When I asked my date how she knew that, she said my grandma. She knew my grandma's name, which was another detail I never shared. As my scepticism began to fade, I asked my date if my grandma could actually see what we were doing. She said yes. My penis automatically disabled its erection function and shrunk in shame. My dick has been soft ever since. Sex was no longer possible for me when I imagined ghost granny not only watching me during sex, but also feeding my partner sensitive information about me from beyond the grave. I didn't sleep at all. My first proper date of the year and I get fucking haunted during sex. 

**Tl:dr Hooked up with a girl who can communicate with the dead apparently. She ended up ""making contact"" with my late grandma while the two of us were being intimate and made me aware that ghost granny could see what we were doing. I was unable to get it up or go to sleep after that.**"
1cck4u8,TIFU by not telling my doctor how many Tic-Tacs I eat per day ,33453,0.89,2171,2024-04-25 11:03:06,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1cck4u8/tifu_by_not_telling_my_doctor_how_many_tictacs_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1cck4u8/tifu_by_not_telling_my_doctor_how_many_tictacs_i/,self.tifu,0,19,,text,False,False,False,"So I'm absolutely fucking obsessed with the Fruit Adventure flavor of Tic-Tacs. The flavor combined with the soft *smush* they make between your teeth when you chew them makes my brain very happy. I've been buying them in bulk, where each container has 200 candies each, and they come in bulk packs of 12 containers. I tend to eat them by the handful while I'm working or gaming, so in a day I can easily slam through 1-2 containers. 

Now keep in mind that on the nutrition label, it says the serving size is 1 candy, and is listed as having 0 calories, which I thought was awesome because I could have as many as I want! 

Over the past year, I found that I gained about 40lbs, and nothing about my eating habits had changed as far as I was aware. I told my doctor about it and she was a bit worried, so she had me do a bunch of bloodwork to see if there was a reason why I gained so much weight in a short period of time. Everything came back normal. She referred me to see a weight loss doctor who would also have me see a dietician. 

I had been working with the dietician for a few months now, and we have me keep a food log. I had a virtual visit with her today and during it, I was fiddling around with an empty container to keep my hands busy. She saw it and asked where I got such a large container from, so I told her about it and how I eat 1-2 of those per day. She asked why those weren't on my food tracker and I said it was because they're 0 calories so they wouldn't count. 

Apparently I was very, very wrong about this. She explained to me that food companies can label something as being ""0 calories"" if the food's serving size contains 5 or less calories. In reality, each individual Tic-Tac actully has about 2 calories. So essentially, since each container has 200 pieces and I typically have 1-2 of those, I've been eating 400-800+ calories *per day* of Tic-Tacs, in addition to all the other food I've been eating - which is very likely why I've gained so much weight. 

TL;DR: Didn't realize that tic-tacs weren't actually 0 calories and gained a ton of weight because I eat so many a day. 

Edit: Just wanted to clarify that I'm aware that sugar will in fact make you gain weight (I'm not *that* stupid), but I never actually read the product ingredients. I assumed they must have been made with something like Xylitol or some other artificial sweetener to make them ""0 calories"" so it never crossed my mind to check!

Edit 2: Dang y'all are brutal lmao. But at least some good came out of it since apparently, like me, a lot of people didn't realize about the ""less than 5 calories per serving"" rule can legally be classified as 0 in the US. Personally I wish we could have the model they do in other countries where they list calories per X amount of grams. 

Edit 3: MY TEETH ARE FINE 😂 I actually just had a dentist appointment two weeks ago. No cavities or decay, gums are healthy. Despite my candy habit I do take good care of my teeth!"

It’s a long story so you can find a TLDR at the end. 

A while back the company I was working for was tearing out and removing an old waste treatment system that was shut down in the ’70s. This was basically a massive underground pit where the waste solids (aka shit) would settle on the bottom of the chamber and the liquids would be pumped out. The thing is when they shut it down it was left full of shit and is by far one of the nastiest jobs I have ever done. 

We opened the pit up by tearing off the top with equipment and were bringing in trucks to pump out the waste the pit was about 16 feet deep and filled to the top with solids. And when I’m talking solids, I’m taking shit tons and tons of shit, condoms, and for some reason pumpkin seeds which I still don’t understand to this day.

One weekend we got a bunch of rain. When it rained, we would pump the water out into the new sewer so we could remove the solids. Since it was the weekend and we had so much rain my boss asked me to swing by and turn the pumps on, so the water didn’t get out of hand. 

So, I went out to the job site alone to turn on the pumps and suck the water out. When I got to the job site, I turned the pumps on, but they were clogged up. I decided to walk into the structure alone and clear the pumps and that is the start of my fuck up that almost cost me my life. 

Since I took my personal vehicle, I didn’t have any of my equipment so instead of using a harness I went in without one which is the first fuck up. This structure was underground, and the pit had large chambers that were broken into basically large upside-down V’s that you could walk on the point which was a foot or two wide. When I got down to the pumps and was crouched down cleaning them my phone rang, and I went to answer it and that was my second fuck up. Being crouched I had to turn my leg and try to get my phone out of my pocket and my foot slipped on some gravel and I slipped off the ledge and fell in. At this point, I didn’t really wasn’t worried about anything besides the fact that I just landed in straight 40-year-old shit up to my knees, however, when I tried to move to get to the edge to get out, I started to sink. Like I said this pit was 16-foot-deep and it was like being in quicksand. I tried to reach for the edge, but it was just out of reach and when I tried to move again, I was now a little over my waist-deep. At this point, I was still fine yes, I was covered in shit but normally the city work guy comes around once or twice a day to check the site so just chill there wait for him to come and he can get me out. Sure, I’m going to be embarrassed more than likely to get in trouble, but I would be fine. The thing is while I stood there covered in shit, I noticed that I was still sinking and that’s when the panic set in. I couldn’t wait I had to get out or I was going to die, I was going to drown in 40-year-old human shit my whole life had led to me drowning in shit. So I instantly tried to get out I tried to kick my way out, I tried to pull myself out, I tried to swim on the top of it all while sinking deeper and deeper and nothing but the thought of the absolute crazy way that I was going to die. 

At this point, I had sunk to my chest and I had pretty much lost all hope and had started to accept my fate and broke into a combination of historical laughter and cursing myself for my stupidity of going down there with a harness. I finally calmed down while I’m reading the wrapper for a condom from like the ’60s and I noticed a piece of rebar sticking out of one of the walls that we had started to tear down. I reached out and stretched myself out more than I ever think I’ve done in my life and was able to grab it. With every ounce of my strength, I managed to pull myself free, and then pull myself to the edge and get out.

I got out of the pit and fell on the ground and looked up at the sky and laid there covered in shit and smelling worse than I ever did in my life and laughed. I was alive, my story had not ended by drowning in shit. 

I got up found a water hose and washed myself off. I threw my clothes away and drove home naked and took what was the best and longest shower of my life and never told a soul how close I came to drown in 40-year-old shit. 

TLDR

I went out to a sewage treatment plant alone without a harness tried to answer my phone and fell in a pit and almost drowned in human shit."
j5u71t,TIFU by watching The Office with my autistic son,33373,0.91,1104,2020-10-06 04:48:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j5u71t/tifu_by_watching_the_office_with_my_autistic_son/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j5u71t/tifu_by_watching_the_office_with_my_autistic_son/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Not actually today, but yesterday. 

But first, some background. 

My almost 8 year old son with autism will fixate on certain things he hears (and the more related to body parts or functions the more he fixates) and repeat them. Over. And over. And over.

On the day in question I sat down on the couch and started watching The Office. My kids love it so they eventually all ended up in the living room with me watching. The episode in question was one where Michael and Dwight trick Jim in to driving with them to the Utica branch to ""prank"" them for trying to steal one of their employees. During the drive Dwight pees in to an empty soda can in the back seat. Michael notices and starts driving badly which causes Dwight to loose his balance and eventually say ""I think I cut my penis on the lid!"" 

I think you probably know where this is going. 

The rest of that day and today my son repeated that line approximately 8 thousand times. He's still saying it to anyone in ear shot, including the neighbor kids and my super conservative mother. There's also nothing I can do about it. Bringing attention to it will just make it go on longer, so I just have to wait until it loses its comedic effect and wait for the next, highly inappropriate but hilarious phrase he decides to fixate on. Hoping by the time he goes to therapy tomorrow night he will have stopped saying it. Fingers crossed. 

Tl;dr: my autistic son heard a line from the office that said ""I think I cut my penis on the lid!"" and won't stop repeating it to anyone and everyone within ear shot.

Edit: first of all, holy smokes, I didn't think this would get the amount of attention it's getting and I'm totally blown away! Front page! Wow. Thank you for those of you who gave me awards and shared similar stories. I've loved reading them all! When I saw it getting so much attention it really made my night!

Second, it was pointed out by someone (sorry, I don't have time right now to find the comment and credit you, but I will later when I have more time to go back through the comments) that the correct usage is ""person with autism"" so I edited the body of the post to reflect that, thank you for the gentle reminder. 

Third, to all the people telling me I'm not a good parent or telling me that I shouldn't be letting my kids watch the office I just have one thing to say: you are a thief of joy.

Edit 2: so I guess I should have looked more in to it before editing. The majority of replies have said that the preferred way to say it is ""person who is autistic"" or that it should be up to the individual on the autism spectrum to decided. So, I'm just going to leave it as is, but thank you all who have commented kindly on the topic."
i4jtsd,TIFU by texting my date that I might end up marrying him seconds after we ended our date,33345,0.91,2213,2020-08-06 08:26:48,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i4jtsd/tifu_by_texting_my_date_that_i_might_end_up/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i4jtsd/tifu_by_texting_my_date_that_i_might_end_up/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Bitchhh, I owe you an UPDATE.

Good news, there’s so much staring at the ceiling one can do before pure boredom kicks in and the realization that the desire to scream “fuck fuck fuck” at the top of your lungs will most likely not last for an eternity. Bad news, you guys did me dirty by blasting my still fresh embarrassment  on the front page and apparently on a famous Portuguese radio show this morning. Cool, cool, cool. 

So, on to the meaty love update. Once I realized the text blunder, I quickly texted him that it was not meant for him, with a crying emoji for good measure. Sweet, sweet man that he is, he responded immediately to let me know that he “doesn’t read texts not meant for him 😉”. I subsequently asked for permission to die. Uh uh, he said. “Please don’t 😘”.

This morning, he texted me about some travel plans we have down the line. Bless this handsome man. The Gods are cruel, but not that cruel. 

This is where I should clarify that the original post was obviously a tad hyperbolic (just like that text, go figure). I slept well last night, and I also laughed. At myself, the blunder, just the ridiculous timing. What also got imprinted on me was that exact moment I wrote and sent that text. The moment he leaned and kissed me good night, I looking at him as I closed my apartment door, locking it and at once turning around and heavily sighing and smiling, keys still in hand. 

Two weeks ago, he had proposed going on a walk at the park. I had an inkling somehow that after knowing each other for three years, he was going to finally, perhaps, become vulnerable and share a few things. I had been in a serious relationship when we met, and, what I know now to be out of respect and my iron clad boundaries, he never made any advances. But I was single now, and at the park, sitting there, together, he looked at me and said he had feelings for me. Long time, three-year long feelings. And right there at Prospect Park, on a clear night, under some 35 visible stars (we counted), he kissed me. Last night, it was my turn to be vulnerable, even if accidentally. 

For once, I think I understand Ted. He was always the guy I wanted to throw my shoe at whenever his ridiculous face showed up on the screen (which was a lot).

As for the “library”, I’m not Jane Austen, but I’m a New Yorker, and the luxury of ample space is not something I recognize. My dream as a child refugee, growing up in deep poverty, was to have a dedicated place for all the books I could buy when I would grow up and have money. Here’s a pic of my library nook that I built through vintage thrifting, DIY projects and patience: [The “Library”](https://imgur.com/gallery/20IAaXU) 


This is it, folks. The update. 
I might prefer this life over any rom-com. 

—————-

This just happened to me. Literally 10 minutes ago. I am dying. I am dead. End me now, O Holy Ghost. 


I thought this only happened in some poorly written rom-coms. The kind where life hardly imitates the real one. I want to bury myself and never come to see the light again. Why me? Oh, why me?! 

Ten painfully long minutes ago, I, exalted by the wonderful date I went with this handsomely gorgeous man who also happened to be a friend of mine for the last three years, against my apartment door that I had just closed on his beautiful face, I typed these words that will fiercely haunt me now : “ Bitchhhh, I think I’m going to end up marrying this guy!”. 

This was meant for my best friend, the only other soul I could muster to express my vulnerable feelings. 

I sent this deeply poetic text to him instead. 

Do you think there is a void big enough in this planet to hold all my misery? All the embarrassment? 

Do you think I can make a pact with the devil to turn back time? I would just need 10 minutes. That’d be really nice. 

Can I please die now? Literal and metaphorical death is the only relief I might know.

I am currently in my library, sprawled across the floor intently starring at the ceiling. Man, I think I’ll be here forever.

TL;DR - I mistakenly texted my date that I might end up marrying him as we just ended our date. Realized too late the text meant for my best friend was sent to him instead."
ebjbrg,TIFU by overtipping my waitress,33327,0.92,1811,2019-12-17 00:22:41,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ebjbrg/tifu_by_overtipping_my_waitress/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ebjbrg/tifu_by_overtipping_my_waitress/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I got an early Xmas card with a $50 bill in it.  I put the bill in my wallet until I could get to the bank in a couple days

On my way home, I stopped at a sit-down restaurant and tipped my waitress with a five-dollar bill...you know where this is going, don't you?  The waitress was surprised and very happy and thankful, which I thought was a bit over the top for what amounted to about a 30% tip.

Comes time to deposit the $50 and guess what, it's nowhere to be found.  After puzzling for several days over where I might have put it, the neurons fire, the connection is made, and I realize that I had to have given it to the waitress, which would explain her reaction.

Well, shit!  I hope she really needed it and I hope it was a blessing, but all I can think is I'm a dumbass.

TL;DR  I was given a $50 bill which I gave to a waitress by accident, thinking it was a $5 bill, and I'm a dumbass.

Edit: thank you all for the kind words, as well as the silver and gold.  Thanks too for the silly comments that made me laugh.  

Clearing up a few points:

My bill was a bit less than $15.  I *thought* I was leaving a $5 bill (about a 30% tip) but instead I left a $50 bill.

I'm American.  All our bills are the same color and size.  Its extraordinarily rare that I've ever had a 50 dollar bill. Yes, yes, I acknowledge that those countries with different size / color paper money are onto something monumental.

I'm a woman, grandma-aged, with grey hair and poor eyesight.  Not a dude.  In my college years I was a waitress, so I'm well aware of the hard work and the struggle.

The loss of the money is not a hardship by any means, but thank you to those kind-hearted souls who offered to reimburse me - your kindness made me want to cry.  I was just feeling so stupid for having made such an easy mistake.

I do indeed believe in karma, and I hope that the $50 helped fill some of her needs.  The karma has already come back to me in the well wishes given here by my fellow Redditors.

As for all those commenting about losing money in a strip club in a similar way, Imma shake my head and say tsch tsch in a grandmotherly way."

I was outside smoking a cigarette in my pajamas. Everyone else was asleep. 
It's a bit rainy and chilly, if that matters.
Anyway, I felt something like a lump in my slipper. I took it off, shook it.. nothing came out. 

Then I felt something, very subtle, near my ankle. I reached down, but couldn't locate it. 
I tried to ignore it but kept feeling these tiny wiggles. I started panicking, thinking it was a spider. I began slapping my leg. At one point by my knee I felt a little lump, and that sent me running into the house screaming. (I am very afraid of spiders).

I burst into my sisters room, turned her light on and removed my pants, all while shouting that something is in my pants my She woke up screaming- scared at my sudden intrusion. 
The dogs promptly ran into her room, as well, confused.

I tossed my pants at her and just kept shouting 'something in my pants!'. She first said it was nothing, then at my prompting she shook my pants (sweatpants). Nothing happened, she told me 'it's nothing, see? Goodnight.' 

I was relieved. I went to grab my pants again, to put them on ( I had been wearing no underwear under my pants, not my best decision).

And my sister started screaming. I look and clinging into the crotch of the sweatpants was a fucking MOUSE. I tossed the pants at her because, well, I panicked. 

We were shouting at each other, both saying do something! The dogs were barking at the confusion. Finally, our parents entered the room. We just shouted at them that there was a mouse. 

My father was like ok. And my mom asked why I wasn't wearing pants and then I started shouting it's in my pants! All over again.

We put the mouse outside. It was very much alive. 


TL;DR  tonight I fucked up because a mouse was in my pants.

Edit: So first of all I am still amazed at how much attention this received. I posted this after my family went back to bed, while I drank a hot tea to calm down a bit. I figured maybe a couple of people would upvote or comment, based on my experiences posting in the past.. When I checked Reddit this morning I was overwhelmed with the amount of comments and attention my experience  got. I showed this to my sister and she had me send this post to her. She absolutely loved it. 

I would like to address a few things brought up in the comments:
  I am a woman. I wasn't wearing underwear, but I was wearing an over sized tee shirt that covered my vulva- only part of my butt was exposed. 

I am not sure why the mouse freaked me out so much. I think probably because a mouse was the last critter I expected to see. 

I am an adult (probably makes this fuck up worse) who currently lives with my parents because of financial and personal issues. I left an abusive spouse  and am working on a divorce. 

My family and my sister are still laughing about last nights scenario. My dad had his own mouse experience when I was a  kid which he brought up today when the mouse in my pants was discussed at thanksgiving dinner. We went ice skating with my dad when my sisters and I were little and he suddenly exited the rink. He removed his hockey skate and a mouse ran out. All the kids sitting on the benches getting ready to go skate were shouting about the mouse. My dad said he felt like the skate was tighter than it should have been. Today he told me 'welcome to the club' and high fived me, haha. 

And I have been enjoying reading everyones own stories about critters who got to close for comfort!"

I work in a small sales company and report to the chief operating officer. Both of us have worked for the company for several years and have a great relationship. She’s was 41 and I was 29 at the time this happened, both happily married. Her name is Kate and my wife’s name is Kari, similar names on my phone...

So, I usually stay late in the office to get myself ahead for the next day. Usually her and I are the last to leave the office.

This was one of those occasions and she texted me she was leaving and to go out the back door. In the meantime, my wife was going on a trip with her sister the following morning and she was texting me about some stuff to pick up from the store in the way home. I jokingly texted her “ok but we need to fuck before you go.” 

Me half paying attention to my phone I accidentally texted that to my boss after she had said she was leaving for the day.....talk about matching the context perfectly. But it was too late.....Verizon’s 4G network shot that into the sky and in her inbox before I could pray to Jesus to take it back. 

I realized what I had just done and said to her before she responded “Kate...I don’t expect you to understand, but that was for my wife.....”

I could hear her laughing from across the office and she responded to the text “try again, I’m out of you’re league ;) I’ll see you Monday” 

So yeah, story for the grandkids about grandpa being a dumbass.

TL;DR: was having a conversation with my boss and wife at the same time and accidentally texted my boss a sexual advance.

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did.  Yeah my boss is very relaxed and I work for a great company. We’re all cool with each other for the most part. Jury is still out whether I could smash though...."

Being the garlic lover that I am, I gave it a shot using a a whole head of garlic...Needless to say, it tasted marvelous! So marvelous, in fact, that I ate the whole head in one sitting at lunch. 

Fast forward several hours and my boyfriend mentions a garlicky odor coming from me. I didn’t think much of it since I assumed he just smelled the leftover fragrances of cooking garlic in the house.

More time goes by, and I start emitting more odors, and he asks me how much I ate so I told him. He then informs me that garlic gets released through your pores as you digest it, and that’s why I smell like garlic and would continue to smell like garlic for a while.

Whelp, fuck. 

By the time we went to bed last night, I smelled so bad that I could taste the garlic in my mouth and there was nothing I could do, but hope the smell would go away by morning.

I was wrong. I showered and scrubbed to no avail. I’m drinking a ton of water to help flush my system, but I’ve accepted that this might be my life now. 

TLDR: I ate too much garlic and now I smell worse than Dracula’s pissed off girlfriend."

I'm fresh out of grad school, and I was part-time teaching as an adjunct professor in a city out East. I have a few lectures with 100+ students.  I'm used to sometimes being flirted with by students, since I am a female close to their age (I'm 25), but I shut it down as much as possible. However this story didn't happen in the classroom.

Every once in a while me and my girls go out to the clubs and enjoy ourselves, drinks, dancing, etc. Sometimes things get frisky and stuff goes down. One night I met this guy, let's call him Seth. He complimented my low cut top and one thing led to another and we were in his apartment doing the deed. The next morning I left like normal after staying the night with a guy.

I didn't think anything of it until a week later when i saw him again. I saw him LEAVING MY CLASS. I froze and gathered my things and left. This student was in my vagina one day and in my class the next. Since then I have made sure to avoid all eye contact with him and pretend he isn't there. I'm worried he's gossipping to the other students and I'll get a bad rep.

I had plans to meet up with some friends in Atlantic City for the weekend. I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

I parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.

That is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I'll be in it?"" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, ""ACTION!""

I start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""I'm not suposed to be here, am I?"" He immediately shook his head no.

So, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. I think to myself, ""if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

I make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn't screw anything up!

After a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they're blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!

Only at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells ""CUT!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

Turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, ""Uh, I'm sorry."" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

TL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation."

I walked up to about 5 feet away from it and starting talking to it. “Hey little coon, how’s it going? I hope you’re not one of those bad coons thats gonna bite me, or that you’re a rabid coon. That would suck.” Then I walked away. I live in a predominately African American neighborhood, and I got a couple of weird looks from my neighbors. I shrugged it off as the neighbors thinking I was weird for talking to a raccoon, which I am. Anyways, I got inside my apartment and joined my buddies discord server and told him about the raccoon I saw, abbreviating it the way I usually do. He then proceeded to tell me that “coon” is a seriously messed up derogatory term. I felt so bad, my whole life I’ve been calling them that because I always thought it was a shortened version of “raccoon.” I literally yelled out in my apartment “I’m sorry everyone! I’m not racist!” Either way, I feel horrible.

TLDR;
I learned that you can’t abbreviate Raccoon because it’s a racial slur"

I got pulled over for speeding again and was arrested with a warrant for the unpaid ticket. I just spent two nights in the slammer and now have a criminal record with multiple misdemeanor convictions – and a crazy story for life.**

**LMK in the comments if anyone wants to see my mugshot! I’ll link to it if enough people want to see. May as well own it at this point! \[Edit: Link below\]**

I \[28 F\] live in NorCal. My best friend from college lives in the Midwest. We're super close and have a long tradition of traveling back and forth to see one another.

I've often done multi-day roadtrips to visit her. When driving through, I've gotten pulled over a few times in small towns in the middle of nowhere. But they always just let me go with a warning or speeding ticket. NBD and totally worth it to see my bestie.

Enter 2020. We're stuck in quarantine and don’t get to see one another. We decide we'll do a road trip as soon as we both get vaccinated. We flip to see who has to drive to see who. I lose and have to travel to her. All good.

So a few weeks ago, we're all set. I cash in my vacation days at work, load up my car, and am off to see my friend for the first time in forever. Yay!

After a few days on the road, I'm driving down a stretch of interstate in the middle of nowhere. I have the cruise control on and am rocking out in my Prius going about 85. (Little do I know, the speed limit is 60.) Eventually, I hear a blaring sound over the K-pop in my car. Police sirens. Followed soon by flashing reds and blues. Damn.

I pull over and turn off the keys. All good. I can charm my way out of this one. Easy.

Out steps this ""bubba"" who looks like the stereotypical patrol cop. I queue up the doe eyes. He's going to let me off with a warning, I can feel it.

In Midwestern accent, he says, ""License and insurance ma'am."" Very abrupt. Something is off.

As he runs my license in the squad car, I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Then it hits me. The last time I came through this state, I got a speeding ticket. And it's still sitting in my glove box. Unpaid. More than two years later!

Okay. No big deal. That's going to be a crazy fine, but nothing I can't handle. What's the worst that could happen?

Well, as it turns out . . .

""Ma'am, I need you to step out of the vehicle. You have warrants for reckless driving and failure to appear.""

My heart sinks. My hands are shaking. The words don't come out. All I can muster is, ""Wait, no.""

""Ma'am, step out of the car."" I'm about to throw up. I open the door and get out.

That's when he says the words I never in million years thought I'd hear: ""Ma'am, put your hands behind your back, you're under arrest."" Before I know it, I'm sitting in the back of a squad car, handcuffed and bawling my eyes out. Goodbye, Prius. Goodbye, roadtrip. Hello, criminal record.

At the jail, I finally piece together what's going on. I have bench warrants and misdemeanor charges from that unpaid ticket two years ago. (It was another 85+ in a 60!) When I originally got the ticket, I had a spaz moment, stuck it my glove box, went to see my friend, and completely forgot about it. Whoops. Apparently they sent me court notices to an old address that I never checked. Double whoops. 🤦‍♀

I get fingerprinted and have my mugshot taken. It's like an out-of-body experience. They stick me in a cell with a bunch of methheads and tweakers (who actually turn out to be kinda friendly). I wonder if I should make up some badass cover story about why I got arrested. I tell them the truth. Before long, I've got a jailhouse nickname: ""Cali space cadet.""

It all goes downhill from there. Long story short, I end up staying in the podunk jail for two nights. They won’t let me bond out because the bench warrant was from another, nearby county that requires in-person appearances and picks up defendants on rotation. At 4AM, they come and pick up a bunch of us at the jail. I – along with about 30 other people in the same boat – get transported into court, decked out in orange and fully shackled.

One by one, the judge starts calling people up. When my turn comes, I shuffle up to the bench and bawl out the story. The judge looks pissed. She starts giving me a longwinded lecture about how I should have paid the ticket. I’m thinking the same thing and just nod along. I feel like an idiot and barely hold it together. By the time it's over, the judge seems to take pity. I bond outta there.

Eventually, I get in touch with my BF. After flipping out, she helps me rescue my Prius from impound and find a lawyer to deal with everything.

All-in-all, with the three charges, court costs, and fines, my original $300 ticket ends up costing over $4,500!

After more than 48 hours behind bars, I get my car back and meet up with my bestie. I tell her I owe her bigtime for helping me get out of the joint and ask what I can do to repay her. She says, “It’s simple – post this to r/tifu!”

Edit3: Thank you all so much for the comments! We are totally blown away by the reception of this post. I had no idea so many people had similar experiences out there. I'm touched by all the stories. I'm really taking your comments to heart. I am never - ever - going to drive that way again!

Changed some offcolor word choices in response to people's comments. Also, for both tickets, I was driving on a straight rural highway with no other cars around. I still completely fucked up by speeding and 100% deserved to get arrested for the warrant, but just wanted to clarify that since alot of people brought it up.

Edit4: Thaaank you all so much! I really appreciate all the awards and thoughtful comments. This was super eye-opening. I never thought this post would blow up but am so glad to have learned from this experience. ❤"
8y0vjm,TIFU by suggesting Twin Peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.,33060,0.93,1855,2018-07-11 21:37:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8y0vjm/tifu_by_suggesting_twin_peaks_as_a_joke_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8y0vjm/tifu_by_suggesting_twin_peaks_as_a_joke_for_the/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,,False,"About two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

As a joke I wrote in Twin Peaks as one of the suggestions.

I am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.

I am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

The day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

About an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

I have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. ""I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today."" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

Other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

It took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

I was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

I came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.

TL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting. Bosses did not research Twin Peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. I got written up for it. "

To explain, my fiancé(M28) has a birth defect that affects his kidneys, and we always knew one day that he would need a transplant. We didn’t expect it as soon as we got it though, which was earlier in this week. He starts dialysis Monday. 
Anyways, in the heat of explaining to me the medical call he had earlier that morning, he said something along the lines of, “I have two years to get the transplant.” 

The pessimist in me took that sentence and ran to the darkest depths, thinking “he has two years left of LIFE.” I’ve been a mess for the last two days, and that’s putting it sweetly. 
So today, I was pressing him about all the places we needed to apply, ways we could get the word out, etc, and I mentioned that we only had a two year deadline. His face fell into confusion, and he was like, “What?” And I explained to him what I THOUGHT he had explained to me, that he only had bittersweet time left. Let me tell you that this poor man instantly came to me in pure concern, telling me I totally misunderstood and that he, in fact, would not die in two years. 

I have never felt so happy to be so dumb in my entire life. 

TL;DR: I misunderstood my fiancé’s diagnosis for a death sentence. It’s not.

smolEDIT: the “two years” thing was apparently just the time frame to reapply to stay on the transplant list! 

EDIT: HOO BOY I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO BLOW UP. There were ~100upvotes and a handful of comments on this when I went to bed about 6 hours ago. I’m going to do my best to read through what I can today! I’ve already seen a lot of great insight and information from those in similar situations with transplants and dialysis. I am VERY grateful to all of you. You’ve given me immense comfort and I can’t wait to show my fiancé as well! Thank you all so much."

I've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. He flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. He even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. I really wanted to show him how I much I appreciated all his gestures, so I thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. I start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. He gives me the signal and I activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view I can. That's where the fuck up occurs. I tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. It took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time I figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. At this point, I just sit there and take it up the nose because I'll be damed if I let man gravy get on anything. I immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but I didn't get it all. Not long after, I feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. I still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

Tldr: A dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

Edit: Holy fuck, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you to whoever gave me my first silver!

Edit 2: Also didn't expect this to get gold or platinum. Thank you all for enjoying my story enough to give me those!"

Although it’s normal for us to shower together, we have to share a standing shower with minimal space so it can get pretty cramped. Things started getting a little steamy, and not just because the hot water. I decided to kneel down and give him head. I’ll spare the details because I’m definitely not an erotic writer (sorry!). We finished and he reached around me for a hug with a smile on his face, and then whispered, “I’m going to pass out” in my ear. 

In the seconds before the next series of events, my first thought was that he was joking. Then his head hit my shoulder and I was left with a 6’3 man’s full weight in my arms. The shower is wet, everything is slippery, and the next thing I know is the weight of both of our bodies crashing into the shower door, which opened, and out spilled my naked body. I look over - my hand is still supporting my husband’s head whose body is slumped inside the too-tiny shower. His eyes flutter open, realizing that he is on the floor of the shower and his wife is laying halfway outside of it. We both immediately get to each other and repeatedly asked “are you okay? I’m okay, are you okay?”. 

Thankfully, neither one of us were really hurt. My husband bit his lip and I have a giant purple bruise across my butt cheek where I landed. He said he remembers having a long dream, even though he was only out for a few seconds. He compares it to when you’re about to die and you see your life flash before your eyes. 

TL;DR - I gave my husband a blowjob in the shower. He climaxed, passed out, and we both collapsed in a naked mess, bruising my bum and our egos."

She's amazing. Simply an annoyed and embarrassed moment compounded by our laughs. She's over it today. 

-----

Edit 2: This was the first and only time the screensaver had ever popped up on the TV. The TV is never left idling, it's only really ever used for streaming tv or music. If it's not doing that, it's turned off. No, my kids did not see it. And the feature was immediately turned off. 

------

I get a text today at work from my wife talking about how the kitchen TV(we have a 49"" fire tv mounted on the wall near the kitchen island) is showing family photos as a screensaver. I didn't think anything of it, and just continued on with my day at work. 

About 30 minutes later all hell broke loose. 

My wife calls me and screams at me that my mother in law was washing dishes when a picture of my very hard dick shows up on the screen next to her. Now, I don't know about you guys, but when I send my wife sexy pics, I tend to close crop them for effect. So she got an eyeful of about 3 feet of cock. 

I immediately start cry laughing. I'm one of those people with a REALLY dark sense of humor. My wife is not amused. She's screaming at me, and all I can think to say is, ""Well, it's not like she's never seen a dick before. How do you think you were made?""

Yeah. 

Wrong answer. 

But at least at this point I can hear my mother in law laughing in the background. 

Oh yeah, forgot to tell you that she lives with us. So this isn't something that I don't have to live with immediately. 

So I get home just before dinner, and it's SUPER awkward. Like everyone is quiet. My kids are none the wiser, they have no idea what happened a while earlier. So I finally look at my mother in law and ask her how her day was. Both of us were laughing before I even finished the sentence. My wife is still pissed. She went to bed and didn't even watch any TV. 

TL;DR

My mother in law saw a blown up 3 foot image of my cock while washing dishes."

8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the ""Birds and the Bees"" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

One day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let's just say I was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

After I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had ""spatooshed"". I just assumed I over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

I was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said ""Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you'll be fine in no time."" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""Thats it, I can't take it anymore. We're going to the hospital.""

Oh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.

We eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. I didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. So they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. At this point it's been 2\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" Right away she yells WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look.

The nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

The surgery was quick and I didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to ""normal"". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would've lost him.

I ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.

Lesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.

TL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

NSFW

This is still fresh in my mind as I'm typing. I take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my Dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. Today was just a routine visit. My folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so I visit with Dad while driving their garbage to the dump. As we are talking I bring up a video I had seen and suggested I share it with him. He agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests I find the video while he does something else. 

Commence Fuckup. 
My Dad has an older model Desktop PC that is quite temperamental and only likes to use Google Chrome. I go to open a window and see that my Dad has 20+ tabs open. All of them were different profiles on FetLife. For those who don't know, FetLife is like MySpace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). I just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. Unfortunately the tab I opened Chrome to was my parents profile page. I not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; I also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. So now, not only do I know my parents are pretty kinky, I also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey. 

TL;DR:
Opened Google Chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular. 

EDIT:words

EDIT2: WOW my first Gold! Thanks Stranger!!

EDIT 3: My wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. She didn't believe me so she temporarily created a FetLife account so I could, for once, be right. Now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. What do?"

This story is not for the those with a weak stomach for blood and other bodily fluids. 

No throwRA cause I’m not a pussy. 

So, now that you’re ready to be grossed out... I have a diva cup, it’s amazing, I save so much money on tampons ect. Today I woke with blood covering the insides of my thighs, annoyed, I shuffle to the bathroom. I sat there on the toilet staring longingly into the distance, having my usual 8am existential crisis. Why am I here? What is my purpose? Why do I have to shove Dracula’s shotglass up my pussy every month? Just girly things ya know. Now, I’d love to spare you these next details but unfortunately I think they are vital for this tale. My rectum suddenly decided that I needed to take the Browns to the Super Bowl. I truly did not think my vagina had the ability to launch a blood soaked lubricated diva cup out of me at the speed of light. I had forgotten to take it out before embarking on my journey. I already knew flushing my diva cup was not an option, so I had to retrieve it. I wracked my brain for a solution, the gloves! I had plastic gloves from when I dyed my hair last! I put on both gloves, just to be safe. I retched before I even dipped my hand in. Bloody poop water is not ideal conditions to go deep diving for a diva cup. I couldn’t feel it, I started panicking as the water rose around my wrist. And suddenly, I had struck gold, I found my cup. Retrieving it and placing in the sink to clean it, I threw up, twice. 
Do not recommend 0/10

TL;DR
Shot my diva cup out while pooping, had to retrieve with a gloved hand and I threw up twice."

I was living in Canada and my very frugal Polish girlfriend would complain about how expensive non-applicator tampons are. For men (like me) who didn't or don't know this, there are apparently two types of tampon; one that looks like a little spaceship that helps you launch the tampon up your vajayjay, and the other that resembles a cotton torpedo that you stuff up there without any plasticky assistance. She was very frustrated that, for a bit of tightly wound cotton, you had to pay so much to plug up the ol' punani.

Fortunately for her, I was going to Europe, where tampons were (and perhaps still are?) much cheaper. Specifically, I was going to Poland, where non-applicator tampons could be bought individually wrapped and in ginormous plastic bags for a handful of złoty. Always looking to save a loonie, my girlfriend insisted that she place an order with me for as many tampons as I could fit into a suitcase. Ever the loving boyfriend, I obliged.

For those wondering how many tampons can be tightly stuffed into a suitcase, it's about five thousand.

Little did I know of the carnage I'd face upon landing. As I approached baggage claim, I heard a mixture of confused mumbling and embarrassed laughter from around the carousel. From a distance, it looked like polystyrene packing pellets had come out of some unfortunate passenger's bag. It took a few moments for me to realise that those pellets were in fact my tampons. All 5,000 of my tampons.

A strap on my soft-sided bag had got caught on the baggage delivery mechanism, and the bag was old and ragged enough that it tore open like a paper bag. My life flashed before my eyes. My instincts kicked in. And then, like the cheapest, thriftiest, most penny-pinching Pole, I launched myself upon the carousel and started grabbing up tampons.

I think I must have stuffed a few hundred in my jacket pockets and down the front of my shirt before I even realised what I was doing. Needless to say, I'd garnered quite an audience, and nobody looked... amused. In fact, they all looked a bit alarmed that a scruffy, bearded man was snatching up tampons with no snatch on a wife or teenage daughter to be seen.

Bizarrely, I decided at this point that I could probably still get away with pretending it wasn't my bag to begin with, so I quietly skulked away with my other suitcase and headed through immigration. Which, in retrospect, must have made me look like an opportunistic tampon thief.

Initially, my girlfriend saw the funny side, until her grandmother -- good ol' Babcia, God rest her soul --  insisted I was an abusive partner for having failed to collect them all. I failed her, apparently, and my lack of dedication to my woman reflected poorly on my already wavering image of manhood. Babcia drove me back to the airport and insisted I fess up and try to collect the rest.

Which is when I learned that the baggage staff had collected them up, and a bunch of employees had divvied them up to take home. So if you work at YVR and are still plugging up at the expense of my shame, you're welcome. My cheeks are as red as your tampons.

**TL;DR:** Brought 5,000 tampons from Poland to Vancouver; bag burst open on the baggage carousel and I snatched up many of those tampies like a champ.

**Edit:** Thanks so much for the awards and karma! No, we're not still together. Realised I was gay about a year later; can't help but think this had something to do with it.

I also wanted to address the NSFW tag, which I added, not the Reddit mods. I did the ""would my own boss approve of seeing this on my screen?"" litmus test. I decided she'd have no issue with vaginas, menstruation and tampons -- as nobody should! -- but she certainly wouldn't approve of my writing style. In case yours doesn't either, it's NSFW!"

My skin is extremely sensitive and shaving it makes it worse so I'm constantly trying new ways to stop the irritation. I had the great idea of trying out coconut oil as a moisturizer. I had bought some that day and it seemed to work fine. I leave the shower and go to bed with my husband.

As we lay in bed one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. Everything is great and I feel nice and moisturized untill my husband starts complaining about his penis burning. He starts freaking out and the skin on his penis got bright red. He freaks out and goes to the shower to rinse it with cold water. The pain just got worse for him and I quickly drove him to the hospital. He was practically crying in pain. He had developed small red blisters all over his penis and the skin around it. We were both freaking out and I explained to the doctors everything that had happened.

Well it turns out my husband is allergic to coconuts and had a severe skin reaction to the coconut oil I used. He is now in bed resting with a sore penis and a severe coconut phobia. So if anyone has any tips for a new moisturizer let me know.

TL;DR I used coconu oil as a moisturizer before having sex with my husband. He had a severe skin reaction to it and developed burning blisters on his penis.

Saturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. We just moved into our new place last week Monday and wanted them to see it. We were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. 

Everything is normal for the first few minutes. I’m just playing some “free” game I’ve spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. Then it happened. A bug flew in my ear. Now this happens occasionally. A bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.

I immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. The bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. My gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. I’m helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. 

The bug did not like the water. It dug deeper. The noise and feeling got worse. I used a qtip to try to dig it out. All i got was blood. My father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. Nothing but more digging and moving. I am literally screaming everytime it moves. Both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. 

My mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. I barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. In the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. So my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   At this point my entire body is covered in oil. I could have used concrete as a slip in slide. I’m naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. 

The oil does nothing but piss it off. We are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. She has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. Apparently this is something used to suck out booger’s from babies noses. My father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. He doesn’t go deep enough because he doesn’t want to pop my ear drum. I didn’t care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. It sucks the bug but it’s too big to get it out. Too heavy for it to hold onto. 

My gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. After 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. I look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. At this point I’m too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. She freaks because it’s a moth. A good size moth. I again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. 

I can not do justice to this event in words. I can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. Picture it yourselves. Imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. Then realize it actually feels worse than that. 

If this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn’t do it again. 

I’d rather be waterboarded while listening to Barney on a loop. Those terrorists had it easy. 

I now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. It shook me that much. 

TLDR: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. Stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. I finally did. It was more horrific than you can imagine.

Edit: I’ve tried to keep up with the comments so I’ll answer some of them here.

I’m still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. This morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. I’ve made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone US). I’ll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. 

I’m now smoking a lot less and mostly when I’m driving . I feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. 

I didn’t expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, I’m sorry. I feel your pain. 

To those saying moths don’t bite, I’m not exactly a bug expert. All i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. It’s truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience."

He was cremated and I went to the funeral, however I never went to the scattering of his his ashes but they had a grave/memorial for him where we had a brass plaque made for him where they had scattered them but I never visited so hadn't seen it, not sure why, we had a good relationship he was a great Dad, whether it was due to finalising his death, laziness or whether it just felt weird.. I don't know 

Anyway I decide today is the day I'm going to go visit, I didn't tell any of my family I was going there and when I arrived ...they've built a fucking carpark for the cemetery on top of his plot, so now due to my slackness I will never get to see it.

I rang my brother and he already knew but since I hadn't been he didn't want to disappoint me sooner as he didn't think I'd ever go, so didn't think I'd ever find out.

Also Depression is shit, speak to someone 

TL;DR put off ever seeing my Dad's memorial for 25 years and now there's a car park built on him"

Well sorry, I am not gay and I am not bisexual. I have a one time ‘gay’ experience and truthfully I regret it. I am not not have I ever been attracted to men in any shape or form. I’m 25 years old and extremely secure with my sexuality and this is not something I’d ever seek out again or repeat. Just something I randomly decided to do while I was drunk and horny. I’ve been drunk thousands of times before and also horny and never done something similar to this. 

So once again please do not tell me what my sexuality is. It’s pretty ridiculous. 

———————————————————————————

This happened about 6 months ago but I ended up having to work with him again recently and the awkwardness came back fully. 

Well the story goes about 6 months ago I was in Florida on a work trip. My buddies and I went out and got drinks and got super fucked up and made it back to the hotel around 2am or so. I’m not sure what compelled me to do so. Maybe being drunk made me super horny and I wasn’t quite sure what to do about it but I ended up downloading the app Grindr. If you’re not sure what it is, it’s basically a gay hookup app... I’ve never done anything like this before but I guess I decided to say fuck it, I want a blowjob. So I made an account, signed in, and immediately got a few messages. Well Grindr has a distance reading and one of the guys that messaged me was 60’ away from me. So I was kinda interested since he was just a few rooms away. He offered to let me come by and he’d turn on some porn for me as long as he could give me a blowjob. Told me he doesn’t do this very often but being away from his wife he likes to explore a bit. Well, I decided to just say fuck it and told him sure I’d be over there in a bit. Stumbled over to his room and the lights were kinda dim which made it slightly easier but he sat me down and gave me head. I finished, he swallowed, shook me hand and I went back to my room and passed out. 

Two days later we’re told to report to work end I show up with my friends and there’s a group of men in a circle talking and we approach them and sure enough I recognized the main boss man. He just looks at me and I look at him and we just awkwardly shake hands again and he lays out the plan for today’s work. I don’t think any of us expected to know each other let alone work together for the next few weeks and it was a super awkward three weeks of working together... Definitely a secret I’m taking to the grave with me. Well besides with you guys lol

Tl;dr: I got drunk in Florida and ended up downloading Grindr and meeting up with a stranger for a blowjob. Turns out he was going to be my married boss for the next three weeks."

I'll start off by saying that my wife has very weak tastebuds. She can hardly taste anything unless they're on extremes of their flavour. Stupid salty, stupid spicy, ect. 

Well it's my job to get the kids ready for school, make lunches, get them dressed and out to the bus, then I go off to work. Well this particular day my wife was working an early shift so i decided to make her a lunch as well. I made ham sandwiches for all 3 lunches, 2 normal sandwiches for my daughter's and one sandwich with THE LAST DAB spread across thickly on both sides of the sandwich. I put them all into baggies and packed up.

If you don't know what The Last Dab is, its a hot sauce made by a popular YouTube channel that sits at 3 million SCOVILLE. It's not for the weak. It's powerful, it sets your whole body on fire and there isn't much to do but try milk and wait for the spice to pass. 

Today around 11:30, I got a call from my oldest daughter teacher saying she was in agony, that she vomited all over the floor and is in the nurse's office being assessed. I immediately knew what I did, left work and rushed to the school. I stopped at a gas station to get some whole milk and some thick milk chocolate to try and help her. I've heard chocolate works but never had the misfortune to try it. When I got there, the nurse had figured out what had happened and I got an earful from her about the dangers of spicy food for young kids and I could have done some damage. I agreed and I just let her go off on me while I was comforting my daughter becuase frankly....I deserved it.  

I explained what happened to the principal who wanted to fill out and incident report. He was understanding that mistakes happen but also said this mistake could have been worse. Again, I agreed. Im so embarrassed.

When I told my wife what had happened when she got home, she went to comfort our daughter, jokingly called me a huge moron, (I agreed) and we had a bit of a laugh with my 2 daughters over it.  My daughter has since recovered and I've learned a valuable lesson. 

Don't make radioactive sandwiches around food for your kids! 

TL:DR - I made my daughter sick by sending her with a supper spicy sandwich meant for my wife."
i219o5,TIFU by showing a new hire what Reddit was.,32840,0.88,1073,2020-08-02 04:04:51,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i219o5/tifu_by_showing_a_new_hire_what_reddit_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i219o5/tifu_by_showing_a_new_hire_what_reddit_was/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"This happened about a couple hours ago and I still want to shrivel up into nothing. So today was a new co-worker's first day on the job, hopefully not her last. My job is primarily male dominated with only a couple female employees and one female manager. Obviously it's nothing against women, it's just not often that we get female applications due to the physical labor we do on the daily. Plus it's pretty much in the middle of nothing, so not many people just stumble upon our workplace unless you already know it's there. 

I'm usually the trainer for all new employees since I've been with the company and travelled to other locations to train new hires. I've spent all day with my new co-worker, showing her the ropes and just getting to know each other. All is going well and we already started to break the awkward ice/first day jitters. 

My male coworkers and managers are very loose and carefree around each other. We joke around and talk about pretty much anything with each other. One of my coworkers, let's call him Jack, and I have this run on joke between each other where we say, ""Hey check out this meme,"" and it's just an ""avant garde"" porn gif or something vulgar like granny titties off of a subreddit. I had just pulled this stupid joke with Jack, had a good laugh, and proceeded with my training.

The new hire and I start talking about what we watch on Netflix, hobbies, and social media. I tell her that I don't have any social media, just a reddit account. She's never heard of Reddit and I didn't know how to explain it to her. So I decided to just show her what Reddit is. She's literally right next to me as I open up the app, and to both of our shock the gif of the old lady getting absolutely railed was still opened. I immediately close the app, apologising profusely, and stumbling over my words trying to explain myself. She just says, ""It's fine,"" and walks away to probably second guess her new job or tell her friend who got her the job about what just happened. I hope she believes my excuse and that I'm not into GILFs. More importantly her mindset on the workplace. 

This will be the last time I pull that joke with Jack. At the end of our shift, she thanked me for training her and that she'll check out Reddit when she gets home. I still want to call off tomorrow since I'll still continue training her tomorrow as well. (I told her that I'll be posting this incident on r/TIFU, so if you're reading this Daniela again I'm so sorry, it won't happen again)

TL;DR. Tried to show a new hire what Reddit was and instead showed her someone's grandma getting railed into oblivion. 

Edit 1: She made a reddit account, asked for help on operating the app, and I brought up the incident again to apologise once more. She said she thought it was funny and that she was not offended. We're getting drinks with a mutual friend tomorrow as well. HOWEVER!!!! I still learned a valuable lesson about professionalism in the workplace. I also learned that this type of behavior happens a LOT on purpose, my accident made me realize that there are men that act like this on purpose on the daily and it's not okay at all for women to have to endure or relocate due to zero consequences of some douchebag that thinks men are superior to women. Furthermore I learned that there's a lot to accomplish in the safety and comfortability in the workplace for women, people of colour, and members of the LGBTQ community. I'm not Scott free from this incident as it will stay with me for all my years in my career to come and uphold the responsibility to make all people love coming to work and not dread/fear it. PLEASE don't just upvote this post for a laugh at my stupidity, but bringing attention to this type of behavior and how it can make someone question their workplace. Sexual harassment is not okay. Discouraging others is not okay. It will not be tolerated, and it must not go unspoken. 

Edit 2: Calling me a simp, a faggot, or a libtard clearly shows that some people don't understand the severity of sexual harassment and y'all are part of the problem, not the solution. Yeah I just wanted to give you all just a good laugh at my stupidity, but hearing personal stories from actual victims in the comments and messages made clear to me that my actions can hold a lot of weight on someone. I just don't want to be the reason someone quits or doesn't want to come into work. YOU just might be someone's reason. Peace!"

Nobody else is at fault here but myself of course, and at this point I can’t help but laugh. I could’ve changed my major at some point, I certainly had to enough time to do so during the 5 FUCKING YEARS IT TOOK ME TO GRADUATE, but instead my dumbass just hoped that business would end up growing on me. It did not. 

I always loved the arts but I couldn’t stomach the idea of pursuing a degree that seems to offer such serious job insecurity. Instead I chose the safe route, and now that’s even harder to stomach. Hah oh dear...

I made my bed time to sleep in it I guess lol whoops.

TLDR: I chose safety instead of fulfillment and now I have a degree that I don’t give a gosh darn fuck about. Follow ur dreams bitch."
i0yy7w,TIFU by leaving the bedroom door open,32817,0.85,733,2020-07-31 07:23:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i0yy7w/tifu_by_leaving_the_bedroom_door_open/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i0yy7w/tifu_by_leaving_the_bedroom_door_open/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"This just happened.

To begin, I recently graduated from college and my lease ended. I planned on moving in with my girlfriend, but due to COVID she moved out of her place and into her mom's. Therefore, I have temporarily moved into her mom's as well until I find a job.

So last night we finished unpacking and after her family fell asleep we decided to have sex. After some fun, we both felt sweaty and hot in her stuffy room so I opened her bedroom door to let the room cool down.

My girlfriend then told me to watch out for her mom's cat because when she used to live here it would always get into the trash in her room, and to not leave the door open if I'm not in it.

Fast forwarding to today, I picked up some herb from the dispensary and packed a bowl. Since we don't smoke inside I grabbed my bubbler, grinder and such leaving my hands full and headed to the back porch for a sesh. Because my hands were full I forgot to shut the bedroom door.

This is where the fucked up part begins. Her family knows and doesn't care that I smoke. I have my medical card so I smoked even though her mom, dad, older sister and mom's neighbor friend were watching TV together in the living room with doors to the back porch.

I get to the end of my session and I'm rather baked, and while writing this I'm still pretty stoned and cringing from all of this embarrassment. But anyway, due to the fact that I got more intoxicated than I anticipated I wanted to sneak off from her family and chill alone for a while to sober up, and play some Luigi's Mansion in the room while my girlfriend napped.

Well that didn't happen. I open the screen door and as I walk in her family looks at me and I anxiously ask, ""Watcha guys watching?"" even though I asked that on the way out. Her mom chuckled and reminded me that they're still watching Tudors and then stopped speaking mid-sentence.

She gasped and looked at the floor causing the rest of the group to shift their attention from the TV.
""Ummmm... Professoroac... I think the cat has something of yours....""

I look at the look of horror on the neighbor's face, the disgust from her sister and honestly a disturbing lack of expression from her dad and then look to the cat.

The cat has a used condom in her mouth from the trash in our room. My hands are full, I'm stoned in a room full of my sleeping girlfriend's family and my cum is dripping from their cat's mouth onto the hardwood floors.

I drop everything in my hands on the kitchen counter. I went for the cat who then began running around the living room spilling my seed now on the rug. Her neighbor friend jumps up on the couch and starts screeching and yelling ""ew"". Her mom can't stop laughing at this point.

I finally grab the cat and take the condom from its mouth. I felt like I sprinted across the room. Threw it in the main garbage and grabbed papertowels for the baby trail left behind.

While wiping up my mess no one says anything but I can feel their gazes burning into the back of my head. I threw it away and then ran into the bathroom to clean up.

Now I'm still in the bathroom too high and anxious to face everyone again. My girlfriend won't answer my texts so I assume she is still in her room sleeping. I hear the TV is turned back on so maybe I can slip by them.

My thoughts are racing but I plan on trying to get back into our room without talking about what happened until another time. If someone says something I'll probably just make a joke or something and nope out of the room.

TL;DR Went outside to smoke some weed. Came back inside to greet my girlfriend's family only to have her cat enter the room with a recently used condom of mine. An awkward chase ensued and now I'm cringing in the bathroom stoned as shit.

Easily one of the scariest moments ever. I was talking to a friend on the phone and eating a burger recently. My friend, B, said something funny and he’s pretty talkative. I wanted to get a quick response in (like a couple words that didnt even matter. Something like “i know, right?!”) so i swallowed and went to talk. Only no words came out. 

I wasnt even really coughing. It was lodged solidly in my throat and the more I struggled the further down it slid. Slowly. B noticed and asked if I was choking and i couldnt respond so i just kind of coughed into the phone to confirm it. He tried to call 911 but lives in another state that will not connect you to another state’s emergency services so it wasnt going to be quick enough. And theres like multiple locked doors for them to get through before they even get to me anyway. 

I was going to die. I started not being able to stand and started getting tunnel vision. I had tears and snot streaming down my face into my open mouth and didnt even care. I shoved my entire hand down my throat and nothing. Remember how i said i wasnt coughing and it was sitting in my throat? I had to actually make myself cough to move it at all. 

And then as i randomly started thinking of irrelevant things (i was losing consciousness and my focus was fading) i remembered this thing my ex liked when id go down on him. I had learned how to utilize my throat muscles in uhh interesting ways. So with my last ounce of energy i manipulated my throat muscles and forced them to shove the food back up. I threw up a golfball sized chunk of food right into my hands and stared at it (why was it so big?! Did i not chew AT ALL?!) before I threw it away and collected myself. 

Yall i sat there stunned for like 5 minutes while B frantically begged me to tell him I was okay. I finally burst out laughing in relief and confirmed what was happening. Then i told him what i did to save myself and we both cracked up. But holy shit man, next time i might not be so lucky. 

TL;DR: I almost died. I gotta learn the self heimlich, i guess."

You have probably guessed what happened next.

Having just woken up and still groggy af, I somehow joined the class and fell back asleep without muting myself or turning off the camera.

Everyone including my professor saw me sleep and snore during the entire class, all their attempt to wake me up were in vain and then they finally decided to continue the class while I snored. 

I woke up to a mail from my professor to remember to turn off the camera and microphone from the next class.

I don't think I will ever show anyone my face ever again.

Edit 2: Removed indentifiers and potential encouragement for harmful ED behaviors



So, here's the thing. I may or may not have a slight to moderate addiction to these delicious violet mint candies.
(I'm choosing not to give away the name of the maker of these candies ~~in an effort to protect the small company.~~ I won't sully their reputation because I sullied my toilet.) 

I recently found these succulent fragrant treats again after trying them years ago on a whim. They are the perfect blend of strong fragrance and chalky texture. I am enthralled with them. 
Or...I *was*.

I forgot all about them until that first fateful day, about 4 or 5 weeks ago, while browsing online for nostalgic candies.

Fuck up 1: I found the same brand of violet candies and was very excited to have them again. I ate all four packages of mints in an embarrassingly short time. I started having some minor poopy issues here and there, but chalked it up to basic bacteria and subsequently forgot about them. I even went to so far as to passively blame by boyfriend by asking him if our dinners were giving him issues too. 
(He has been picking up a lot of the slack in the cooking department since I got a second job. Bless him.)

Fuck up 2: Seeing how I needed to refuel my latest addiction, I went directly to the manufacturer's website and...you guessed it...ordered 2 WHOLE BOXES of mints. 

-Fuck up 2.0: Almost a moment of clarity-
Something told me look up the ingredients of the mints, just for shits (lol) and giggles. I briefly read something about - specific chemical name-, but the article had too much of that darn fancy science mumbo jumbo. So, I went on with my life, or...what was to become of it, my careless days of yore.
I should have trusted my gut...literally. I've read that animals have basic instincts of impending doom, like a signal of their own death. If only I knew my impending doom would result in the lament of my toilet. My triumph turned to tragedy. My seemingly harmless addiction leading me into a dark bathroom of despair.

Since the delivery date of my precious violet goldmine, I prided myself in how well I was conserving the candies. I only ate a few here or there, and would just pop a few in my mouth at work. Luckily I have been busy with both of my jobs, so I only ate them at home for the most part.

And so began the turmoil of my poor gastrointestinal system. I began to notice more frequent trips to the bathroom, oftentimes more and more painful and horribly-smelling diarrhea. I mentioned it to my boyfriend because I was becoming concerned. I told him ""It's the smell...it's like nothing I've ever dealt with. It's not normal, but more like a chemical smell?"" I even asked my boyfriend a few more times if he was having similar issues.
I was also very projective and passive-aggressive about his cleanliness around the kitchen. I feel awful and know I owe him a big fat apology when I see him. Poor guy :( 

(Sidenote: I chalked these bathroom trips to stress from the recent zoom family therapy  sessions, thinking I was so clever for remembering that ""stress can do that to you, y'know."" I totally didn't take into account that I was EATING THE MINTS DURING THERAPY. Yeah, I'm *such* an academic.)


Fuck up assurance and toilet resolution:
A few days ago I started noticing my weight was dropping pretty fast. Again, in my brilliance, I credited this to me working a lot as well as quitting soda. I switched to tea and coffee. (I also thought the coffee was to blame, but coffee never gave me those painful, cramping, and horrid blowouts.)

Last night I stayed up very late talking on the phone for almost 3 hours with my sister, catching up about stuff that happened in our family therapy. By the time our call was up, I had consumed 1 and one-third entire packages....about 20 mints or so in just that phone call's time. A new record. But there are no wins here, only profound losses.

Today's Fuck Up Confirmation:
I woke up a few hours later at the asscrack (lol) of dawn. I was strangely feeling hungry. Bf went to work. I kissed him goodbye and went back to bed. Or so I thought. A violent violet cramp began to rumble until I was nearly doubling over on my way to the bathroom. Total (violet) Recall. (Bonus Willy Wonka quote: ""You're pooping violent violet!"")

And somewhere between my agony and my confusion, something just *clicked*.
I went to search that pesky chemical I remembered from the ingredient list. 
And welp, what would you know: magnesium stearate, when consumed beyond small doses, acts like a LAXATIVE EFFECT...........Fuck.

For clarification: I consumed almost 14 entire packs of mints, plus a few extra from the first order, in 4-5 GODDAMN WEEKS?! I did the math for 18 packages....that's 270 MINTS. 270?!?!?!
(My bowels when reading this: I gotta get outta here!)

Pls kill me.

Jesus Christ I'm so dumb it hurts. It literally hurts. My butthole. My pride. My self-assurance. But most of all, my butthole. 
The memory of these mints has been tainted by my willful ignorance, now conditioned by my folly. I feel sick just looking at them now. 

RIP my sweet violet mints of long ago: once held in the light of careless happiness, now fallen to the deepest recesses of a hell where toilet blowouts reign.

- - - - - - - - - - 
But most of all, I'm sorry to you, my sweet innocent boyfriend. You're amazing and I will be reading you this after work. Love u bby :{

TL;DR for those with normal gut health: I ate a fuckton of violet candies in a very short time and got horrible diarrhea for weeks. Turns out it was a chemical ingredient that caused a laxative effect. 

TL;DR Lite Version: Bad thing in candy make tum tum go ouchie. Ate many candy in short time. Feel sad and not smart in brain."
u5stcu,"TIFU by letting family back into my life, unaware that I had won the lottery years prior",32733,0.88,1927,2022-04-17 23:46:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u5stcu/tifu_by_letting_family_back_into_my_life_unaware/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u5stcu/tifu_by_letting_family_back_into_my_life_unaware/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,,False,"So backstory. I, (36M) am the youngest of 5 children (boy-girl-boy-girl-boy) and we grew up in absolute poverty. Mom loved having kids but she didn't work and dad didn't make enough to support everyone. Poor enough that I remember as an 11 or 12 year old receiving a single plastic slinky and being absolutely thrilled I got anything.

Growing up with that kind of family was rough, parents got divorced and dad lived locally but didn't really do much to try to be a dad. Just support financially when legally necessary, and he let it slip once to me that he never wanted any kids. He just loved my mom and she wanted kids so he went along with it. Obviously with this kind of dynamic and the absolute lack of resources, home life wasn't great prior to the divorce.

I was helping fix drywall at like 5 years old because we could only afford to live in crumby run down houses. I remember stripping paint with a steamer and putty knife at about 6 or 7 and only learned recently that the house had lead paint. Oldest siblings did even more housework and probably inhaled a bunch of lead dust and toxic substances. Couple that with the emotional abuse of our parents and they didn't grow up to be good people.

My oldest brother had anger issues and got kicked out of college for fighting people. He also got arrested a few times for stuff involving theft or violence. Oldest sister struggled with substance abuse, got arrested a few times, ended up involuntarily committed for 72hrs once. She's doing a lot better nowadays but still an unpleasant person. Next brother went on to just be an employee at a large chain store where I think he might be a manager now. All 3 still live in the impoverished town we grew up in.

My next sister and I are close enough in age that we're very similar. Both joined the military to escape the poverty trap of our hometown. I joined the Army and she went Navy, even at about the same time. While in the service, we both pieced together a bunch of things about  our siblings and parents that made everything clear. It was like we both had half of a connect-the-dots puzzle that made no sense, and when put together the outcome was a big sign that said ""EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY IS AWFUL.""

She confronted them about it after her contract ended and got kind of dragged into the drama all over again. She moved to a city near the hometown (about 1 hour away) and started working there right away. I cut everyone else out of my life. I hadn't spoken to most of them in years, and the others are cursory and obligatory in nature.

After my contract ended I started college using the GI Bill which not only paid for my tuition, but also paid a monthly housing stipend so I can focus on school. My family fucking HATED that I was basically getting free school to them. Couldn't explain that it meant giving up 4 years of my life for active duty and I have to drill every month in the reserves, and part of my body is permanently wrecked; to them it is an unfair advantage. While in school, I had a habit of buying a lottery ticket every month when the GI Bill hit my account. It was borderline superstitious as I never had any notion of winning because I remember a statistic once that said men in California have a higher chance at actually being Brad Pitt than winning the lottery.

My final semester I won. I didn't win Fuck-You money by any means. I won the type of money where you could pay cash for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house with .36 acres in a county where housing prices were below the national average and then have nothing left. Yes it's specific because that's what I did. I never told any family, including my cool older sister because as much as I love her she would almost be obligated to tell the rest of them. The purchase of that home happened when I was 25, so 11 years ago. Since then I got married and had a kid and have an all around nice and pleasant life.

About a year ago, oldest sister was going to be near where I lived (several time zones away from family) for work and she wanted to visit me so she could meet my daughter and catch up. Against better judgment, I agreed because my wife wanted to know more about my family who she had never met.

So sister was staying with us for 3 days before she had to go do her work stuff and spent the whole time just reminiscing and catching up. At one point during dinner on the 2nd night she asked about what my mortgage must be like, since she paid $900 in rent for something much smaller and with no yard. My wife scoffed briefly, unaware that my family didn't know of my financial windfall.

Sister, though a troubled individual, is no dummy and picked up on that. Her tone shifted from casual to serious and asked ""What does that mean?""

I am not great at lying, improv, or doing anything without excess planning. I sat stupified while trying to figure out what to say before my wife said ""Well he used his winnings to just buy the house.""

Thus setting off the chain reaction of questions that culminated with sister finding out I made 6 digits for free while ""attending college for free"" and ""getting rent paid while not doing any fucking work."" She was absolutely livid and left for a hotel.

About 2 hours later the phone calls began from every member of my family accusing me of cutting them off so I wouldn't have to share this gift from god. The sister I got along with even got angry at me for keeping it a secret, but she understood that it would have put her in a bad position of lying to family. My phone, email, and wife's phone began blowing up for the next week while family tried to get money from me not understanding that there wasn't any left. They kept saying that they're about to file for bankruptcy because of debt and I could save the family but I'm just being selfish.

After a week, lawyers got involved because my family started threatening to sue me for damages for everything wrong in our family (they eventually did file). Every single thing that could even remotely justify going to small claims court or a full lawsuit was brought up. They even added up an estimated amount of gas money I borrowed since starting to drive at 16 with verbal agreements to ""pay you back later"" taking into account inflation and current gas prices. Everything together they asked for would have just been short of buying another house in cash.

I'm able to post this now because I was able to get about 90% of it dropped for being absolutely ridiculous, and showing that a lot of their claims occurred during a time when I had no contact with them (thank you phone and email records). The remaining 10% of what they wanted was stuff that happened when I was 17 or 18, like denting one of their cars or injuring them when I threw an empty beer bottle during a fight and leaving a permanent scar where the glass cut them.

After lawyer and court fees plus paying damages, I lost a bit more than $10k to family. The stress from the legal battle affected me at work and when it got out I was being sued by family after winning a lottery, all my coworkers began asking for help financially. It got bad enough (people coming to my home at night) that I had to request a transfer to a different branch where nobody knew me. Now I'm having to sell the home I bought, where my daughter was growing up in, and move to a more expensive city where the other branch is. All because I let my family back into my life

&#x200B;

TLDR: grew up poor, family sucked, joined military to escape poverty, found out family sucked even more than previously thought, went to college, basically won a house in the lottery, never told family, a decade later family found out, they sued me for every single thing they thought they could, I lost $10k due to fees, had to leave my job and move to a bigger city, all because my family sucks.

Moral of the story: Don't let family back in"
jupbqd,TIFU telling my yoga instructor I could suck my own dick,32708,0.83,2346,2020-11-15 22:42:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jupbqd/tifu_telling_my_yoga_instructor_i_could_suck_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jupbqd/tifu_telling_my_yoga_instructor_i_could_suck_my/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,,False,"This was pre covid in January, and honestly with everything that has happened I think I did my best to forget this.  But I was just reminded due to a past due bill in my emails, and you all seem to love my stories so, enjoy lol.

I’m pretty well endowed, and skinny, and flexible, and have the unique talent of being able to suck my own cock.  Judge all you want, make your gay comments, but if you could, you would.  No, it doesn’t quite feel like getting a blow job, just like jerking off doesn’t quite feel like getting a hand job.  But it feels fucking amazing, and i’m a bit of a sexual deviant so it’s just some added freakiness to a normal horny day sometimes.  I love it.  And ex girlfriends have loved it, random hook ups have loved it.  It’s quite a party trick, let me tell you.  Lol.

So I met a girl on Tinder who, for whatever reason, our conversation swayed to this.  We hooked up, she really really enjoyed watching me suck my cock.  Now not to be too descriptive - but i have a very large head of my cock when I’m super turned on.  Which, if I’m sucking my cock I’m super turned on lol.  I can get my mouth around the head, but I can’t get much down the shaft.  especially as not much as I used to.  She kind of put me in these yoga positions to help, and it was insane I was able to get much deeper.

Logically, I went home later and researched this and kinds of yoga and decided I was going to go to yoga to get more flexible so I could suck my own cock a little deeper.  Yup.

I found a yoga place, signed up, and went to the first few classes.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn’t really helping much and we really weren’t doing the positions that Tinder girl put me in.  The next class, the instructor was helping out, and when she came to me she helped move me a little and it was super helpful.  Not in a self fellating way, but a yoga way.  After class she was chatting with people and to me she mentioned about working on the position at home and how to address it alone.   

She asked if I had been practicing long, and what my intentions with the practice are, and honestly, i don’t know wtf i was thinking, but I fucking said it.  I said it!  Super non-chalantly too, I said “well, it’s to help with sucking my own dick”  

She didn’t laugh.  She didn’t say “what?”.  She just walked away.  Like quickly and angrily.  Not sure if anyone else around me heard, but it felt like I said it over the loud speaker.  I was cringing beyond belief and couldn’t even hear anything but my heartbeat. I just grabbed my shit and left as quickly as I could.

The next day, I got a call from the studio saying the don’t tolerate sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior of any kind.  I am banned from all 4 of their establishments and I am lucky the instructor doesn’t want to press charges.  I wrote back apologizing and saying it came out wrong, but it sounded defensive, it is absolutely insane that I said that.  

I think i’m done with yoga.  And I’ll just be okay with my self sucking skills as they are.

tl:dr - went to yoga to get more flexible so i could suck my cock deeper.  and I told the instructor.

edit - to answer some public and private questions... 
sure, I guess it feels like a dick is in your mouth, but in the same way jerking off feels like a dick in your hand, or playing with your pussy feels like you’re playing with a pussy (i’m guessing, lol).  to me the pleasure is the focal point.  but i’m kinky and weird, so who knows.  i’m guessing to enjoy it, you have to be comfortable with your own dick in your own mouth.  big deal.  i’m more than comfortable with that.

and onto the next question.  yes, I cum in my mouth.  Not every time, but i have many times.  judge away

edit 2:  yes I have swallowed.  often the position requires i swallow or id spit it up all over myself.

edit 3: yes, i’ve cum on my face.  i don’t think i’m the only guy that’s done that, that’s happened just jerking off before.

edit 4: okay, the photos in women’s thongs are a a whole other story.  that doesn’t make me gay still, i’m not confused.  i just know what i like sexually!

edit 5:  my r4r posts.... yes, I have met up before just to jerk off for them.  no i have never met someone before to do this act.

edit 6: I’m 41 years old

edit 7:  I first tried sucking my cock in my teen years when i realized i was well-endowed.  i thought that self-sucking was the benefit of a big dick, later I learned about girls and stuff.

edit 8: some of you are very mean, lol.  to go out of your way to DM me the things you’re saying is weirder than sucking your own cock.  who cares what I do.

edit 9:  i know i fucked up!  i was totally wrong and I believe she would be well within her rights to press charges against me and I’m very thankful she didn’t.

edit 10:  damn people got real mean once this ended up on the front page.  yikes.  i guess the tifu crowd is a little more accepting than the popular crowd.  that was fun for a while but not really any more.  goodnight!"

My husband and I generally don't have any trust issues. However, his ex girlfriend cheated on him several times so obviously some scars still carry over towards our marriage. 

We have a (4F) daughter and (1M) son, and we recently found out that I was pregnant. I found out first, I was feeling the nausea HARD and used a pregnancy test that I still had from the box from the last time I thought I was pregnant and, boom, baby in the oven. 

I found out on April 2nd and decided to wait until the 25th because that's my husband's birthday and thought it'd be the best birthday gift ever. Pregnancy brain kicked in fast, though, and I carelessly dropped the test in the trash under some toilet paper (I didn't what to touch my pee covered stick more than necessary) while forgetting my husband is the one who takes out the trash. 

Come next morning after the trash is taken out, my husband doesn't say anything so I think he didn't notice it. Come the 15th, we're grocery shopping when suddenly my husband starts crying and goes to the bathroom, I didn't want to drag the kids inside the men's bathroom so I call him on the phone and he, still crying, asks if it's his baby. 

This MAN- 

I'm not about to have this conversation inside of a Fry's so I manage to get him out of the bathroom, we go outside, I tell him my plan and give him a hug and apologize and he's laughing so hard he can't breath and then tells me to never do that again before he apologized for running to conclusions.

And then we went to get frozen yogurt. Food for the soul. 

TLDR - didn't tell my husband that I was pregnant, he thinks I'm cheating on him, breaks down in a grocery store, and then we go eat frozen yogurt."

I´m a student  in Cologne, Germany. My parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. I couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot. I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs. My dad told me she would calm down soon. They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

TLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

EDIT: So my mom called me today. She apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. She told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. She has absolutely no relationship to it. She said that she is proud of me and that I should be carefully with smoking weed.   
Thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! Didn't expect that to happen. I try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed."

I've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, I joined a dating site.  


I started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn't been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn’t want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn’t seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. 


It started well and I was like fuck YES, let’s do this! So I said as much. I also said you’re not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He’s a liar. So bullet dodged. 


Anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I’m like STRIP because I’ve gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I'm grand.



There’s a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. It’s over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he’s just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


So I’m trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


Blood.jpeg


So much fucking blood. Well, I know it’s not a wild period since I’m not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I’m like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I’ve never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


We have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it’ll stop. 


Nope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don’t want them thinking I’m some harlot. I'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


Wake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I'm freaking the fuck out. Obviously can’t tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I’ve broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I’ll ever have sex and it wasn’t even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she’s wonderful.


Get in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.

Theres surgical glue on my vagina. I'm never dating again.

tl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

EDIT: First, wow. I didn't expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.

Second. To clarify, a Spider-man as I meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the PLAH!! Spider-man version is also great! Hope that helps.

I’ve been laid up in a hospital bed since then, so give me a break and just read the damn thing. 

Wednesday night the BF and I were kid free for the evening and decided to go out on a quick date. Ended up having a blast at our local joint, then came home and did the deed. Wanting to spice things up a bit, we tried a new position. Don’t get too excited, it wasn’t anything acrobatic, just different for *us*.  I jokingly said afterward that I needed some Advil after cause I doubted I could walk afterwards. 

*ha ha ha*

I would live to regret that joke. 

My pelvic area began to ache about 10 minutes afterwards. I said to him “I’ll be right back, I guess I really do need an Advil” and went downstairs. My pelvis began to hurt so I stopped  in the bathroom and immediately collapsed. The pain was surreal. My body began to shake. I started to sweat. I had my phone with me and frantically tried to dial my BF cause I couldn’t muster up the breath to scream for him. My fingers fumbled about, I couldn’t get my phone to work. I was losing consciousness. A few seconds later my BF comes downstairs to get something to drink and finds me on the bathroom floor. 

Next thing you know I’m at the emergency room. 12 hours I was in the ER unable to move due to the extreme pain. I cried out and my vitals were crashing, I looked 3 months pregnant, my stomach was swelling. 

Thankfully a nurse named Hannah stopped by and recognized my symptoms just as my stomach went rigid and my vitals tanked. I was rushed to the OR. 

2 hours later I’m being awoken by a nurse and told that I had what was called a Hemorrhagic Cyst of about 6cm that had ruptured as a result of our sexual endeavor and was bleeding out into my abdomen at an alarming rate. How alarming? 2.5 liters of blood was removed during surgery from my abdomen. That’s how much. I required a blood transfusion. 

Recovery will be long. My body is totally wiped. But at least I can say the sex was good. 

TLDR; Had sex and ended up almost dying due to internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst. Better now.

EDIT:: Apparently the position is called “The Mating Press”. 

And for the assholes who keep messaging me that I’m a damn liar, here’s some photos from the [ER VISIT](https://imgur.com/a/YmkQa5l). Do you want my discharge papers too? Jesus."
e6jih2,TIFU by accidentally spooning with my boss,32595,0.91,1010,2019-12-05 21:55:06,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e6jih2/tifu_by_accidentally_spooning_with_my_boss/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e6jih2/tifu_by_accidentally_spooning_with_my_boss/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened about 6 years ago, but a little piece of me died that day and I cringe everytime I think about it so here it goes:

So I (27M) work construction. I'm comfortable with my sexuality but the trade is inherently very macho and homophobic.(important later) So anyways, I had been looking for work for about half a year and finally landed a job with a local contractor. We seemed to get along fairly well so I was looking forward to working for him. 

Well, me being fresh out of trade school, I was naive and had a toolbox chock full of ""gimmicky"" tools and apparatus that were supposed to make my life easier but any veteran tradesmen would know is absolutely useless crap. One such example, my toolbelt had ""new and improved!"" hammer loops, which was a partial loop with two little spring loaded arms (they looked like pinball paddles) so you could just slap the hammer into the loop instead of sliding it in from the top. Sooo amazing...

I show up for my first day decked out in my future-age carpentry gadgets and about 20 pounds of clothes because it was the dead of winter. After exchanging pleasantries with my new crew, I was shown where I'd be working: 30 feet up on a narrow scaffold plank with my new boss. No biggie.

So him and I scale the scaffold and begin working. At some point, my boss needs to get on the other side of me, so I scoot to the edge of the plank and he starts sliding behind me...

*CLICK*

The front of his belt promptly gets lodged into my fuckin hammer holder. Like I said, we were wearing lots of clothes so it took a minute to see why we were stuck ass-to-balls, and we embarrassingly chuckled before trying to free ourselves. My hammer was in the loop already, so with his part of the belt in there as well, there wasnt enough room for the little arms to fold back and release me from my nightmare.

 For about fifteen minutes we shared that intimate moment on that scaffold, before another coworker came around the corner. After asking what the fuck we were doing, he proceeded to take a wedding's worth of pictures of us while laughing hysterically. I had had enough. I took my pliers and ripped off the arms on the hammer holder. Free at last, we worked the rest of the day in silence.

I promptly went home and threw my belt into my wood boiler. If you ever want to break the ice with a new employer, just force them to spoon you on your first day.

TL;DR my boss and I got stuck together ass-to-balls on my first day working because of my stupid belt

Edit: it was extremely cold out and the suspenders attached to my belt were under about 3 layers of clothes. The only way to take my belt off was to undress, attached to my boss, on top of a 30' scaffold. Not happening. It may not have been 15 minutes, I didn't get out my stopwatch, but it sure as hell felt longer than that.

Edit#2: The coworker taking the pics was my boss's stepson, so I'm not about to message him and ask ""hey remember 6 years ago when you caught me and your Pa spooning? Mind sending me the pics?"" Sorry to disappoint:("

My mom’s best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

V is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.

One of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let’s call him A) who she introduced to us as a “good friend”. A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

For those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It’s a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Yugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.

That evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he’s been out of Bosnia, etc.

I start to think of something witty to say to “vet” him. Something funny.

I asked him if he’d ever killed someone, jokingly.

He looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.

He went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person’s. He wasn’t a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

I felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can’t imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

After a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.

—

TL;DR: I thought I’d make a funny joke and ask my friends’ date at dinner if he’d ever killed anyone. Turns out, he did during the civil war in former Yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. The joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day."

I’m working from home, don’t need to be paying rent in FL if I can just live with family instead.

So, I pack my shit up, store the rest in a storage unit, close my lease, and hit the road. My cat, Randall Flagg, accompanied me in the car as we drove through Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and then Kentucky.

I was going about 105 mph in a 70 MPH zone when the KY State Trooper pulled me over. I was making incredible time moving that quickly, but obviously the risk is being pulled over. Or death.

Anyway, State Trooper comes to the passenger side of my car to stay away from highway speed traffic. My car was already off, so my window did not roll down when I tried that. Instead, he opened the door.

During the discussion, we actually addressed the fact that my cat Randall could escape, and I asked if I could step out and keep the car sealed. That didn’t end up happening.

After the traffic stop, maybe about a minute of driving later, I realize Randall is not in the car anymore.

*Bolt of absolute panic*

I pull over, again. This time without a state trooper behind me. I frantically shout for him inside the car. Check the foot boxes, seats, his little nooks, Nothing.

My mind racing, I leave the car on the side of the highway, and begin running back south to where I was pulled over. I reach the area, completely spent. Voice is totally thrashed from shouting over the sound of the highway for Randall.

The women who lives next to the highway, where I was pulled over, hasn’t seen him.

I have burrs all over my shoes and shorts from tromping through the Kentucky woods and fields next to the highway.

I call the non-emergency number, my vet, my mom. Dad.

45 minutes of shouting and walking along the highway.

Serious emotional distress. My boy, my best bud is lost in these fucking woods somewhere.

I see a state trooper nearby, he’s very helpful and actually drives me back around to the area I lost Randall to keep looking, and gets the officer who pulled me over to come back also.

No luck.

I interact with more nice families in the area, leaving my number with them.

Randall Flagg is hiding somewhere out there and he is too scared to come out.

Or. God forbid. He was hit. Cant think about that right now.

The officers help me relax, take me back to my car back north up the highway.

A detective with the troopers helps me look around the car again, just in case. No Randall.

My car is now dead when I try to start it bc the hazards were on too long.

Great. I have some jumper cables stuffed inside somewhere, but it’s full of my shit as I’m moving, so I have to start pulling things out. The Trooper with me didn’t have cables, somehow.

So I’m pulling bags out to access the area where the cables are, when I see motherfucking Randall Flagg’s fuzzy black ass inside a half-full garbage bag that had a lot of my clothes and towels in it.

He’s totally asleep, peaceful as a fat baby.

I apologize to the officers profusely but they are completely professional about it, just glad that he’s been found. They help me jump my car, and I get rollin again.

Stayed much closer to the speed limit after that.

Randall Flagg and I safely made it to Chicago the next day. He’s extremely comfortable here at my dads.

TL;DR I was pulled over and my [cat](https://imgur.com/a/7J6PxRU) escaped into the Kentucky woods next to a highway, but not really, he was just asleep in my car. I worked on my cardio and made friends in rural Kentucky while looking for him."

He asked me what to bring and after talking a bit he asked if I had brought some condoms. After a few seconds of awkward silence I just burst out in laughter and told him that he wouldn‘t need them anymore and hung up. His face when we picked him up was priceless. The girls kind of took it with humor aswell, but the next minutes of the drive were definitely a weird mix of awkwardness and laughter.

Then I fucked up again after picking him up by reversing into another car :/

TL;DR Had two girls in the car that me and a friend were about to double date, I call him on the car‘s speakers and he asks me if I have condoms."

It’s quite funny. Go do something productive and donate to BLM organizations or post bail for a protester. Don’t be a keyboard warrior



This happened earlier this evening. So it’s my day off and I decided to take the day to pamper myself and this routine includes doing a charcoal face mask. This mask is, obviously, black. Masks are so normal that I have never once considered that it may look wrong on anyone’s face, hence why I’m a dumbass and didn’t think twice about leaving the house with it on. 

I also never care much about what I look like. So when it was near time for my boyfriend to come home, right after applying my mask, I went to make dinner but felt really lazy and decided I was going to go through a drive thru instead. I honestly forgot for a split second I even had a mask on my face. 

So I get there, order, and pull up to the window. The woman is an older (white) lady and she looks at me very weirdly, with a look of horror on her face. She doesn’t say anything. I think, “why is she looking at me that way?” and hand her my card. I ask how she’s doing and she doesn’t say anything as she takes my card and shuts the window. I’m like huh, okay. It dawns on me as I sit there that she’s probably totally judging me for wearing a face mask out like a complete slob, and I chuckle about it. Then she comes back. 

She’s mad this time. She hands me my card back and goes “actually, we’re not going to be serving you. We have a zero tolerance policy for behavior like this and I’m disgusted at what you’re doing. Do you think doing this is a joke?” And I am *completely* taken aback. I think she must have the wrong person and ask what I’ve done wrong, to which she replies “really? You’re going to sit there and pretend you don’t know exactly what you’re doing? How can you be so disrespectful and do black face, especially with everything that is happening right now. What is wrong with you?” And she’s waving her hands at me while she’s yelling. My stomach instantly drops when I start making sense of the situation and I start panicking. Word vomit starts tumbling out and I’m trying to tell her that it isn’t like that but she keeps yelling, and finally the manager comes over to the window. I’m in tears at this point, not because she’s yelling at me but because someone actually thinks I’m doing something so incredibly vile toward other human beings. 

The manager looks at me panicking, looks at my face and tells the lady to stop talking. I quickly tell the manager that I am *not* in black face, I’m just in a face mask, and I’m incredibly sorry for even leaving the house in it, but I figured it was okay going through a drive thru. The manager sighs really deeply and tells me she can definitely tell that I’m in a face mask, and starts apologizing to me. She tells the lady “Donna, people use face masks for their skin. That is not black face and you have completely embarrassed this customer....” and starts chewing her out right there while I sit there awkwardly. 

Anyway, I ended up getting our meals for free, but I now know how incredibly stupid it is to leave the house wearing a face mask. 

TL;DR went through a drive thru in a charcoal face mask, lady yells at me and accuses me of doing black face, I freak out, manager comes and apologizes, I have learned my lesson"
dum4jb,TIFU by wearing my late grandfather's shoes to a job interview,32473,0.94,828,2019-11-11 08:30:59,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dum4jb/tifu_by_wearing_my_late_grandfathers_shoes_to_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dum4jb/tifu_by_wearing_my_late_grandfathers_shoes_to_a/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"This happened January, 2018.

I was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a Bachelor's degree. To provide some background, I graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a STEM major to apply. And so I did even though I barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. But hey, might as well.

Surprisingly, they invited me to do a ""1-on-0"" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it's a pretty awful experience. However, they were all soft-skill questions so I could answer them pretty decently. After that, I surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. I was very excited.

Now for the fuckup: My family has an assortment of dress shoes that I could wear for the interview and I ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. They were lookin fresh. I put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.

I entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. I was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. Right as everyone got up to enter the ""group case"" room, I looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. I quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.

It turns out that the shoes I wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. They were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.

At that moment, I was just thinking ""oh god oh man"" but didn't want to let anyone know about it so after I got up, I pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. Unluckily for me, everywhere I walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. It was a nightmare. Thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn't too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. We walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. It didn't go too well and I left another big mess in there but oh well.

Afterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. I was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. One of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind I was screaming. I wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.

I ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some Starbucks on the main floor. When I went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. Holy shit. I kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. We sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. On the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. However, this time I was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn't go back to grab it or something. So I just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. At this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that I was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.

We got back to the conference room and the moment I entered the room, I noticed two other people hovering around where I was sitting originally and said ""what's all this black stuff?"" looking at debris I had left earlier. I pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. At this point, I was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. However, I continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris I was leaving behind everywhere.

Finally, it was my turn to do the interview and I walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss's office. He told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. I was so glad he did that as I frantically picked up the crumbs that I had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as I could in my pockets while he was gone. As I was doing this, all I could think was ""how did it come to this..."". The interview itself went pretty well though.

After everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. All I can say is RIP to the cleaning staff over there. By the time I got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.

Needless to say, I did not get the job.

TL;DR: Wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as I walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as I continued to not acknowledge that I was the culprit even though I'm very certain everyone knew it was me."

Nearby my unit is a man named ""Frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why I know her boyfriend's name). Now Frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of Friday and Saturday nights. Annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, I began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. As an added bonus, I could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so I assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.

&#x200B;

However, tonight, I noticed something kind of strange. They were having sex, per usual, and I began to play music to cover up the sound. I stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" For some reason, though, I didn't do anything for a few seconds, and I heard the guy, Frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or I'm not going to cum"" through the walls. I listened a while longer to see if I'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. It was at this point that I came to a terrible conclusion. In my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, I managed to pull some weird Pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, I played guitar and sang. Thus, whenever I started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. When I'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually Frank and his girlfriend. Unsure if I was right, I started playing another song and when I finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so I figured that I'd assumed correctly.

&#x200B;

My neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that I've caused this problem (which I have). At this point, I'm listening to Frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because I tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&#x200B;

Edit: here's a video I uploaded as proof that I'm actually playing music. They weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)

2nd Edit: Wow, this really blew up. Hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! Regarding proof of their sex, I’m not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. To answer everyone’s questions, the song is an original, but I’ve never recorded anything professionally and I play as a hobby.

3rd Edit: This a few months later, but some people said that we should try to record the song, so we did! Hope those few that see this enjoy it!

TL;DR: Thought I was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out I was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. Neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because I acted as a musical facilitator."

But I have let some bad habits seep in. 

I'm sure anyone in an office knows that like 80% of the meetings you attend could probably just be an email. But since we are meeting via Zoom, and since a lot of people don't even enable video, if I am in a meeting I know isn't important and where I probably won't even have to speak, I just mute myself and go sit on the sofa and play a video game on mute or browse the internet or whatever. Or eat lunch. 

I have an odd quirk that I do when I eat by myself. I talk to my food and to myself. On the day in question my lunch I had a sandwich and some pita chips with hummus. So, for example, I said something like ""Mmmmm, there's hummus among us!"" Or when I had a chip I would say things like ""That's what I call a chip!"" or ""Welcome to my Mouth, Mr. Pita!"" 

And the sandwich, I pretended it insulted me, so I was like ""Did you just call me a bitch? Hooo boy, you just buttered the wrong biscuit. NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!"" Or later I would comfort it, like ""Don't worry, had my fiber gummy, you're coming out smooth. Mm hmmmm."" 

I wasn't really listening to what was happening in the meeting, but finally I heard my name a few times. To my horror, I had not muted my mic. They heard it all. My Manager was saying rather curtly, ""Can you please mute yourself?"" Some people were laughing. I mumbled an apology and muted myself. I got a stern message from him later saying I should wait for lunch until after a meeting, and if i had to eat during a meeting, mute myself. 

In our Slack channels people are making fun of for talking to my food. But it is clear, they think I am insane. In the eyes of my Manager I have lost all stature, and in the eyes of my co-workers I am a lunatic. This could have negative effects on my career. I am actually thinking of quitting tomorrow. 

TL;DR - I didn't mute myself during a Zoom meeting and my boss and co-workers heard me talking to my food."

I also have asthma, so it's rough. I'm going to the doctor later today, but in the meantime had to attend a Zoom meeting this morning.

I was in this Zoom meeting with about 15 other people when I unmuted to ask a question. I leaned back in my chair to really give off the beard-stroking academic vibe, and I heard a crack as some piece in my old AF Ikea desk chair exploded and the chair back went all the way backwards. And so did I.

Both of my cats, situated nicely under the computer monitors on my desk, did what cats do when there's an unexpected noise and completely lost their noodles. In classic kitty form, they destroyed everything in their path, knocking my mug off the desk and onto the floor, shattering it.

Meanwhile, I lay on the floor on my back having a huge coughing fit. I untangled myself from my chair and headphone wires and got up to go grab my inhaler. In the process, I stepped on some pieces from the shattered mug with my bare feet. I let out another round of cough-laden expletives as I walked away.

A few minutes later, I had my shit sorted out and came back to my desk and keeping with the theme of pandemic-related TIFU posts, I realized I had been unmuted the whole time and with my video on. Apparently my colleagues had just spent that time conjecturing on whether I had left my earthly body behind or what.

Minus 5 points professionalism for me, plus 10 points hilarity.

TLDR - unmuted on Zoom, chaos ensued.

I(32f)got lost in my favorite hiking park (it’s huge). I thought I was deep in the woods. I was pulling my two toddlers behind me in one of those cart things you can hitch to the back of a bike for kids to ride in. I rigged it like a stroller but it got too hard to push... so I used the wrist strap and tied it to my back belt loop. Had just climbed a huge hill 3x going back and forth (lost). I had tracked through a swamp and was covered in mud. Again, I thought I was deep in the park and hadn’t seen another person all day. 

So .....boob sweat is a thing. I ditched my bra and was wearing a loose tank with buttons all the way down the front. I undid them all. Was at a level of “fuck it we are all going to die here”. GPS was not working.

And then ....I stumbled into a field adjacent to a parking lot I’d never been to before. Into a crowd of 14yos and their parents. Some had grad gowns. I had my tits flapping in the wind, my progeny hauled behind me (tied to my butt, like the banana boat girl), and mud almost to my elbows.

A nice gentlemen offered me directions. I was less than half a mile from my car -_-

Fuck. My. Life.

cezn0m,TIFU I said no to my Gf's proposal.,32270,0.88,963,2019-07-19 04:30:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cezn0m/tifu_i_said_no_to_my_gfs_proposal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cezn0m/tifu_i_said_no_to_my_gfs_proposal/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. 

Yeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

It's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

I want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

I saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

I guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!

Anyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.

In the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. ""We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!"" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

In the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

Now I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

Thanks for listening.



TL;DR
I said no when my GF proposed bc I'm on chemo and don't know if I'm gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

EDIT: Thank you so very much for the silver, gold and platinum!"
jsz28z,TIFU by answering a call from an unknown number,32254,0.91,886,2020-11-12 23:08:59,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jsz28z/tifu_by_answering_a_call_from_an_unknown_number/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jsz28z/tifu_by_answering_a_call_from_an_unknown_number/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I always answer calls from unknown callers. Not sure why, I guess it feels like my ticket to adventure and mystery. This habit almost always works out fine. It's typically a wrong number call. I'll pick up the phone, say hello, and the person apologizes and hangs up. 

But lately I've been getting a lot of spam calls about some car I don't own. Almost every other day they call me, and it gets annoying. So I've started answering in strange ways. You know the drill, pretending you're from a Denny's in New Mexico, pretending to be a scammer, etc. No harm done, right?

Well, just a few minutes ago, I got a call from an unknown number. I thought it was the car people. So I answered, in my best peppy receptionist voice: ""This is Jimmy's euthanasia clinic and buffet, where yesterday's loss goes in the sauce! How may I help you today?"" There was a long pause. After a few seconds, I said, ""Just kidding. This is \[my name\]. Who is this?"" A few shuffling noises came from the other end, then silence. I hung up.

About thirty seconds later, I got a call from the same number. I said hello like a normal human being, and the caller introduced himself. It was the tech guy. From my school. He was calling to follow up on a very professional, respectful email I sent him a few months ago about school-issued computers. 

Yikes.

TL;DR I answered what I thought was a spam call and said something stupid. It was from someone at my school."

The voice deepens, musculature increases, genitals grow and gain hair, a beard and moustache come in, and the feet develop a hard, protective crust.    
All natural physical development. 

Or so I had assumed until this weekend, when our ""pod"" got together at the beach for a little summer fun.   

I've always enjoyed walking barefoot on the beach, as the gritty sand tends to wear down the thicker calluses and slough off shedding skin layers.   
Sometimes I would even use a pumice stone to sand them down thinner so that they wouldn't tear up socks as badly as when left natural.

Now, I've never really paid attention to feet, never really looked at them closely or had a fetish for them like you hear about, so even with partners playing with their feet just wasn't something I ever did. I've seen women's feet in movies like the toes scene in The Big Lebowski, but assumed women just have softer feet than men. I probably had plenty of opportunities to see other mens' feet at the pool or gym showers, or wherever, but without having really any interest in feet, I can't say I've looked closely at anyone's feet, ever. 

But on this day, one of my guy friends was wearing bright purple nail polish.   

It caught my eye, naturally, and it occurred to me that somehow his toenails were long and flat, like fingernails, not white and bunched up like toenails.  And his protective calluses were almost missing!  Not the sanded-down smooth appearance from walking in sand or using a pumice stone, but virtually absent altogether!  I wondered if this meant he didn't often walk barefoot, and so never developed them, or if he had some method better to sand them down.

So I asked, ""Hey, I noticed your nail polish, your new style?""        
""Ha, no, my daughter wanted to practice, and couldn't say no!""      
""I couldn't help notice how flat your toenails are, and you have almost no calluses -- do you use some sort of special cream or trimmer to get them to look like that?""      
""No, they're just normal feet.""       
""But you don't have any calluses on the bottom.  Normal feet have calluses to protect them when walking on hard or rough surfaces.""  

And showed my foot as an example.

""Um, wow,"" he said, ""how long have you had that? Are you taking any medicine?""        
""Taking medicine? For what?  These are just normal feet with normal calluses.""        
""No, no they're not, that's like the worst case of athlete's foot I've ever seen.  How long have you had it?""    
""I don't know what you mean ... my feet have always been like this ... this is just how feet _are_.    ... isn't it?""      
""No, not at all.  That's foot disease.  It's some sort of fungal infection.  There's medicine for it.  Have you never heard of athlete's foot?""      

Yes, I had heard of athlete's foot.  From TV commercials advertising creams to treat it.  But they never showed _pictures_ of it, nobody had ever told me what it _was_, and nobody for over thirty years after I went through puberty mentioned that there was anything at all wrong with my feet.

Never has a doctor mentioned it to me.     
Never has a partner mentioned it to me.    
Never has a coach mentioned it to me.  
Never has _anyone_ mentioned it to me.

I just thought that's how feet _are_.

Epilogue: with the obligatory ""this happened two weeks ago,"" I immediately visited a dermatologist the next business day, got a diagnosis and medication, and my feet are already halfway through a magical transformation.  It's incredible.

---

TL;DR: While going through puberty my feet developed thick calluses and I thought this was a normal part of growing up.  Nobody ever told me my feet looked strange, I never compared my feet to others, and I never realized anything was wrong with my feet until asking a friend how they made theirs so smooth and they told me I had athlete's foot for thirty years.     
          
^(Edit: typos, formatting, &c.)

UPDATE: Since everyone is asking for photos, I've uploaded in-progress treatment photos [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/vUtBQZl).  The first photo is of my toenails, the second of my heel.  All toenails used to look like my little toe looks now. They are growing in flat and translucent now.  The pinkish areas on my heel and side of foot were also covered in the same white-yellow callus three weeks ago before seeing the doctor.  And the callus was _MUCH_ thicker and flakier.

For illustration, the top picture in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete%27s_foot) and the ""side of foot"" photo on the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/athletes-foot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353841#dialogId27257934) site are almost _exactly_ what my feet looked like before.

---

UPDATE 2: The medicine prescribed was Terbinafine, a prescription daily oral anti-fungal pill. It is apparently quite strong, requiring regular blood work to monitor liver function. The doctor expects it to take six months to be completely cured including new toenails growing out cleanly.   The doctor took skin samples and ran tests to confirm it is indeed Athlete's Foot, not other similar conditions people have mentioned.
NOTE: This is apparently a very powerful medication which as noted can affect liver function, and many pharmacists and others have commented to note that people taking it are not supposed to take paracemetol/acetaminophen or drink alcohol during the treatment.

Bit of a backstory, I (26M) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30F) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


My parents, and my youngest sister (15F) are out of town on vacation. Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don’t have a garage).


So I’m going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


This is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn’t want them to lose their shit.


This is where the fuckup happens.


It works. I’m quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.


It was not the dogs playing.


It was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.

With her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


I have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


I also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


And what she sounds like.


I literally screamed “my eyes” covered them and ran out of the house.


I’m outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


Send help.



TL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.

Sometimes, while walking, I’d set myself a personal goal, like “reach that pole by the end of this song” or whatever (I listened to music while I walked).

Well, one time I saw someone walking in front of me. They were a considerable distance ahead of me, but I decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time I reached my turnaround point.

So I started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. At the time I didn’t think anything of it, because, hey, we’re both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

As I slowly yet surely got closer to her, I noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. I’d had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, I only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, I’d turn around and look behind me, because I thought she may have heard a bike bell that I hadn’t heard over my music. Meanwhile I kept my speed up because I was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

Near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it’s of course here that I finally catch up with her..

As I get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what I can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). Aimed directly at me.

I immediately realise what I’ve done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
I gave her the most awkward smile in the world while I powerwalked past her, walked WAYY past my turnaround point so I could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

As an added “bonus”, I later learned that there was a notorious rapist named “the bike path rapist” that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He's a little fucking hellion. 

His hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work.

My gf is South African. Her native language is Afrikaans. I've been learning how to speak Afrikaans without my gf knowing. I secretly applied for online courses that I've been using on and off for more than a year now. My plan was to surprise my gf and her family with my ""American Afrikaans"" when I finally meet her parents in person for the first time later this year. I never intended to eavesdrop or anything, but learning Afrikaans in secret accidentally exposed me to sensitive information that my gf was sharing on the phone with her Afrikaans speaking friends from South Africa. It was gossip I was not supposed to understand, but eventually I did. This is what I've heard in the past few months: 

1. My gf is planning to surprise me on my birthday by reuniting with her high school metal band and putting on a show for me.
2. My gf wants to tattoo the names of literally all the Harry Potter spells on her back, but she doesn't know how to tell me because she's afraid I'll talk her out of it.
3. My gf casually mentioned that one of the unexpected differences between her glasses and her contact lenses is that when she's on her knees looking up at me with her glasses on, my penis looks much bigger compared to what it looks like through her contact lenses, which is why she's keeping her glasses on during sex (ouch).
4. My gf is convinced that my parents are swingers because apparently there are always attractive couples hanging out at my mom and dad's house whenever we visit. 
5. My gf secretly finished the entire series of Better Call Saul without me, even though we agreed to finish it together, so now she's pretending to have no idea how the show ends. 
6. My gf is thinking about cancelling the high school metal band reunion for my birthday because she's no longer sure if it's appropriate to team up with two of her exes that are original members of the band. 
7. My gf expects her dad not to like me. 

I would've preferred not knowing most of those things to be honest, but there is no way for me to unlearn Afrikaans, so now I'm cursed with knowing too much while having to pretend I know nothing.

**TL:DR** 

I secretly learned my girlfriend's native language as a surprise, but during my learning phase I became capable of understanding what my girlfriend was gossiping about with her friends when she thought I didn't understand. I've come to regret not telling my gf that I was learning her language from the beginning because I know things now that I wish I never knew."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So the TIFU happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

This is gonna be TMI, but that's kinda the nature of TIFU, so whatever. I'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. I also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. Sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and I don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (AKA the Taco Bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it AIN'T FUN. So I had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. Less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. So I trimmed it off at night, added some Aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. Win-win!

Fast forward two days, and I'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. Classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl I've dated, so I wanna shell out the monies of course. Dinner went pretty well, and we got Coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. Turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

But, guys, I can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  We're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and I just had to let one out. I'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so I'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. And this fart was NOT SILENT! It was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart I've ever had in my entire life, hands down. I was mortified. She immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and I of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. She did not laugh with me...No text-backs so far.

I googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. So a little TIL there for you inside this TIFU. Just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so I can go on dates again.

Edit2: Man I shouldve used my real account for the awards! Guess I'll have to switch over to this baby.

TL;DR - I shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. Turns out it makes your farts super loud, which I discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after."
hwcc46,TIFU by yelling “I bet you wish you were back in Africa” to my black coworker across a busy parking lot.,32084,0.91,950,2020-07-23 14:26:01,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hwcc46/tifu_by_yelling_i_bet_you_wish_you_were_back_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hwcc46/tifu_by_yelling_i_bet_you_wish_you_were_back_in/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This was not today but last winter (I am in Ohio so it gets very cold). A funny tale of accidental racism. I work as a night nurse at a busy hospital. A good friend/coworker of mine is from Liberia in Africa. We will call him Jim. We had been friends for a few years before this and my friend had just gotten back from a month long trip to Liberia to see his family. 

We had just finished a crazy night shift and were walking out to our cars outside the hospital. Now this being pre-corona the parking lot was swarming with patients’ families and workers coming in for their day shift. It was about 20 degrees F (-7C) out that morning and snow was coming down like mad. So Jim starts walking more towards his car and I towards mine. It being so cold I shout out “HEY I BET YOU WISH YOU WERE BACK IN AFRICA HUH JIM”. It took me about 2 seconds to realize how bad that sounded. As I look around to see if anyone noticed about 6 people were looking at me baffled.
 The next day I told him what happened and all the looks I got and man did he have a good laugh.

TL;DR: I yelled something at a coworker that sounded kinda racist out of context. Coworker thought it was funny.

Edit: Thanks for all the likes and comments guys! I need to sleep but I am glad some of you got a chuckle! For those who don’t see the racism part I totally get it. It was more the other people’s reaction that made it feel like they thought I was racist. If that makes any sense. But anyway rascism is very fucked. Love each other damn it."

Me (23f) and my boyfriend (22m) have both been struggling with mental health stuff recently so we've not really been *in the mood* (if you know what I mean).
So today we were making out and things were starting to get a little heated so my boyfriend asks me to check there's nobody else home. Normally he means to just check out of the window and see if either of his parents cars are in the driveway which they weren't so I tell him we're all good. We proceed to have very loud, somewhat kinky sex. 
After we're finished he goes to the bathroom to clean up and makes a jokey comment about how we left the bedroom door open and that it's a good thing nobody else is home. Then we realise we can smell food cooking. I never checked if his younger sister was in the house. She definitely heard us and everything that was said during. I have never been more embarrassed.

This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.

So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.



I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. 



So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.

TL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation"
rzanxg,TIFU by gag gifting my daughter,31998,0.94,590,2022-01-09 03:04:51,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/rzanxg/tifu_by_gag_gifting_my_daughter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/rzanxg/tifu_by_gag_gifting_my_daughter/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,,False,"Found out today this humorous chain of events - well humorous depending on where you are in the chain.

I saw a month or so ago that someone bought a box of ferrero rocher chocolate and wrapped Brussel sprouts in the wrappers so I did this to my daughter. I unwrapped each piece and carefully wrapped a Brussel sprout in each wrapper and returned it to the box. Then I sent the gift and waited.

Christmas morning we talked and she thanked me for the candy. I asked her if she enjoyed them and she said yes - I knew she hadn't opened the gift yet, but why lie? I then realized that she probably re-gifted them. Then I asked again and she admitted that she had too much candy and wanted to get rid of some of it and her boss loves ferrero rocher. So I told her what I did.

She was amused but mad - mad at herself for regifting something I gave her as we are always doing stuff like that. It gets better.

She called her boss on Christmas day to tell her and her boss was like, ""Oh shit!"" She had re-gifted them to a client she was trying to keep after they'd had a heated exchange. The client is overweight and by the time my daughter's boss was able to call her it was too late. She wouldn't come to the phone. She was convinced that the wrapped vegetables was a slight and a message.

As far as I know she lost the client but isn't mad at my daughter.

EDIT: Glad this post amused so many people. Here are a few notes addressing the comments.

* It wasn't a giant box of candy, it was a 5 piece box. 
* I ate the candy as I wrapped the sprouts. No chocolate was harmed as a result of this prank.
* The candy was one of many gifts and stocking stuffers we brought over. It wasn't like a $200 box of chocolate was re-gifted. 
* I wrapped the sprouts on the 23rd and gave them to my daughter that afternoon. She took them as an afterthought to a party at her boss' house to add to a gift box she gave  to her boss.
* Her boss dropped them at the clients house on the 24th. 
* My family all agreed a few years ago to stop giving each other candy at holidays as we are all always trying to lose weight. 
* My opinion on regifting. It's actually a great thing if thought is applied. When it comes to gift giving I believe that it is the thought that counts. If I give a gift you can appreciate the thought and still share the gift with someone else. Whatever. To each is own. Thanks everyone :)

TL;DR I gave a gag gift that was re-gifted until it ruined someone's Christmas."

Some time in this whole play activity, she asked if I could stick my penis in a bottle.

Now, this was a weird thing to me but I thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so I went ahead and did it. It didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes I know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. She started laughing and I started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. She never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. She knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. I begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. Now my dick was straining and I started to get really worried. Then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

Long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. The bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). Since yesterday, peeing still hurts. She thought I wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

TL;DR I fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**Edit**: So my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

If you come back here to check, no I'm not taking it down, I am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well I hope you didn't). Sorry, I'm keeping it up. See you at 8."

So, a few days ago I was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: They had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

There's no way people were just finding this place on their own. It was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. So, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

Last night, I went there to get some food... for research, ya know... Anyway, I was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. The pizza was really good. The beer selection was varied. They had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. Pretty good stuff. Even if I wasn't writing for them, I would've given them 5 stars on Yelp, is what I mean.

When I was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

I wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""Where Wine Country Is Next Door!""), but I was determined to get something usable. 

Finally, it hit me: ""Go Somewhere."" It had nearly everything I wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

But, still, it wasn't quite there. It lacked the feel I wanted, felt a little too abstract. Customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. They needed to be pointed.

After another hour or so, I had it.

Eventually, the slogan I pitched these poor people was this:

""Go Somewhere Else""

Which, I believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""Get the fuck out of my face.""

They haven't emailed me back.

TL;DR: Today I fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan I wrote and I'm pretty sure I definitely lost a client because of it."
mzqkzz,TIFU by exclaiming “it smells like a dead body” when an actual dead body was in the house.,31894,0.93,841,2021-04-27 20:39:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mzqkzz/tifu_by_exclaiming_it_smells_like_a_dead_body/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mzqkzz/tifu_by_exclaiming_it_smells_like_a_dead_body/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happened in 2015 when I was a senior in high school.

My grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer in September of 2014 and had been told that it was terminal. He had just retired and we were all really sad that he wasn’t going to be able to enjoy retirement with his wife (he remarried after my grandma). He was a goofy guy who wore pants with embroidered ducks on them and always had a magic trick to show everyone when we would visit. During his last day alive, my mother, sister and myself came over to support his wife. There were also neighbors coming in and out of the house saying their goodbyes and just consoling each other. When my grandfather passed away, we were all in the room with him and told him we loved him and that it was okay to let go.

After we left the room to give his wife some time alone, my sister, my mom and I went downstairs to join the neighbors at the dining room table. This table was able to seat about 8 people and it was full so I was standing next to my mom at the head of the table. People had brought food to snack on and someone brought a cheese plate. I did not notice this cheese plate, so I started to comment about how stinky the room was to my mom and sister. Eventually I said the words “it smells like a dead body” OUT LOUD in front of everyone. The room was silent except for my mom and sister’s attempts to conceal their laughter. I turned beet red and added “erm...dead cat” to the sentence and then abruptly left to use the bathroom and reassess my life. I know my grandpa would’ve laughed if he heard it so that makes me feel better, but I can never look any of those neighbors in the face without remember that moment 🙃.

TL:DR While standing in a house that had my recently deceased grandfather upstairs, I said “it smells like a dead body...erm dead cat” because someone brought a stinky cheese plate.

I was working in a cinema at the time and Avengers: Endgame was out. I was working the day shift in the week so it was relatively quiet. A woman came out of her Avengers screening complaining about the sound balance. I went to check in the screen and the movie sounded normal. So I went to check the sound level on the speakers and they were all set to the normal levels.

I came back and explained to the woman that all of our levels were normal. She insisted that they weren't. Now, I'm somewhat of a movie buff and have noticed a trend in recent years of action films having really poor sound mixing. The dialogue is usually too quiet and the action too loud. I don't know where this trend came from, but everyone seemed to finally realise when Tenet came out and they couldn't hear a damn thing anyone was saying.

So, I said to her that that's just how Endgame sounds. That for whatever reason, the sound mixers made the dialogue too quiet and that I find it to be a really annoying stylistic choice in modern filmmaking.

The look of rage that engulfed her face cannot be described. I don't think I've ever seen someone go from 0-100 on the anger meter that fast.

""I *AM* THE SOUND MIXER!"" she said. Turns out she worked at Pinewood Studios and was the person responsible for what I had just described as bad sound design to her face.

She went on a whole tirade about how she knows more than me as I just had to stand there and take it. I still stand by my belief that the sound mixing in Endgame was not good, but I never thought I'd end up saying that to the person responsible for it.

TL;DR Was working at a cinema and a customer complained about Endgame being too quiet. I told her the sound mix was bad, turns out she was one of the sound mixers for the movie.

EDIT: I am talking about Pinewood Studios in London, England, not the one in Atlanta, Georgia.

EDIT 2: There's no need to call her a bitch, guys, I've had far more hostile customers, believe me. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I'm sure she's a nice person.

EDIT 3: Please stop suggesting that I should have taken her to personally inspect the equipment. I would have been fired for breaking a myriad of rules. It was a no-win situation.

EDIT 4: The cinema in question wasn't far from several major production studios and several high-profile location sites for big Hollywood movies. So the odds of me serving someone who worked on Endgame (which was partially made essentially down the road from me) are actually pretty high.

EDIT 5: She might have worked at Shepperton Studios, which is next to Pinewood. I'm honestly not sure which one it was.

FINAL EDIT I PROMISE: I fully acknowledge that she knows more about sound mixing than me or most of the people in this thread. However, as consumers, we have a right to voice our opinion if we don't like a product. The fact that the VAST MAJORITY of the commenters agree that action films nowadays are way too loud in some places and quiet in others shows that there is clearly a problem. You don't have to be a professional chef to know if your food tastes bad, and you don't need to be a professional sound mixer to know if a movie sounds like trash."

I’m still shaking like a leaf but I’m slowly starting to realize how hilarious the situation was.

So I (F18) recently began drinking cream soda. The bottles look a bit like beer bottles, but it never really dawned on me how similar they were until now.

A few minutes ago I was sitting in my car at a red light. There was a half-drunk bottle of in the car, so I drank some of it while I was sitting at the light. There was a cop car in the lane next to me, but I didn’t think anything of it.

The light turns green and I go, the cop instantly pulls behind me and turns on full sirens and lights. I was shocked because I’d just pulled forward at a light. I was barely going 10 miles an hour, the light was green, I wasn’t on my phone, I couldn’t think of anything I’d done wrong. But I was the only car he could be signaling to so I pulled over, and this guy gets out of his car and comes over to me as I’m digging around for my license and registration. 

He knocked on the window and said “ma’am I need you to step out of the vehicle right now” and I’m sitting there thinking “what the hell is going on? What did I do?” but I complied because I’m an anxiety ridden person and I was terrified of what I might be in trouble for. He looked at me for a moment and said “Ma’am have you been drinking?” and I said “no, I’m 18.” He looked into my car, frowned, reached in, grabbed the bottle out of my cup holder and said “Oh.”

After some apologizing on his part and awkward laughter, he explained that he’d seen the bottle and thought that it contained beer rather than soda. I was in shock and wasn’t sure how to react so I just awkwardly laughed and said “oh yeah...sorry...it’s soda....” meanwhile I’m standing there shaking because the situation seemed so so bizarre. Cop got back in his car and drove off, and I’m still not sure what happened😂

TL;DR: I drank cream soda at a stop light, and a cop pulled me over because he thought it was beer, resulting in me being scared sh*tless because I had no idea what was going on."

I was too afraid to bring tissues into my room as it seemed too obvious so eventually, with my galaxy brain, I realized I could just shoot it down in the gap between my bed and wall. At this point I hadn't quite fully developed object permanence and for over a year assumed it was ""evaporating"" or something down there, out of sight out of mind... until it was time to paint. 

   With both of my parents in my room, unscrewing outlet covers, laying blue tape etc. I decided to move my bed and, to my horror a year's worth of cum was crusted, running down the wall. I quickly moved it back and tried to devise some reason for why we should paint another day, I decided that if I went and cooked something I could force my parents to come out and eat it while I went back in my room and painted over all the fucking CUM on my wall. Then not only would I be a good boy for cooking dinner, I would also be a good boy for having painted on my own with the added bonus of saving myself some embarrassment.

  I don't remember what I cooked but I wasn't fast enough, when I came back in my mom was on her knees scrapping all the dry, flakey cum with some sort of metal tool. Before I could say anything she looked at me and said ""This is DISGUSTING. Why would you SPIT all over your wall? If you need to spit do it in the toilet, or just swallow it but you can't spit all over your walls, why would you do that?""

  I'm almost certain she knew what it was and was saving me from embarrassment, and for that she's a real trooper. I'm 21 now so it may be time to just ask.

TL;DR: I used to cum on the wall next to my bed, my mom moved it and well.... cum wall


EDIT: This got bigger than I expected so I'll add a couple things. 

1. There was no possible way I could brag to my friends about all the karma I've just aquired without explaining to them what a cum wall is. Naturally they now know what a cum wall is.

2. I take slight comfort in the fact that unlike the shoebox and coconut this mural, as much of a work of art as it was, was never meant to be erected

3. I'm seeing the links to creepily similar stories, looking at my post history you should be able to tell I'm not a troll, I don't even post a lot, just happened to be reminded of this by something a friend said last night.

4. It may comfort some of you to know my current living space is the exact opposite of a neckbeard nest, girls say I'm ""really clean for a guy"". So not a neckbeard, I just be cummin doe"

This was years ago and I will not tell specifics and I will use fake names but this is the most epic FU I have ever heard of and it was me that FU. I was in the military but we were stateside. There was a group of fellow buddies with me. This was the night we all learned what a Jager Bomb Shot was. We had round after round after round after round. The night went by extremely fast and my friend Brian decided he would drive myself and my roommate home to our off base appointment. We left the bar and it was not long before we were pulled over. Turns out that a sedan having 3, 21 year olds leaving a bar at 2 am, near a military base is suspicious. The police officer knew we were all drunk when he got to Brian’s car window and we all admitted to it. The police officer gave Brian a breathalyzer test which he promptly failed. The office handcuffed Brian and put him in the back of the police car. The officer then asked myself and the other passenger, who again was my roommate, if we would like to take a breath test and see if we were below the legal limit to drive Brian’s car to our apartment so that it would not be towed and therefore would save Brian the impound charges. We took our breath tests and promptly failed. This is when things begin to get weird. 

The officer left us with Brian’s car with the car keys also. The officer drove off with Brian to take him to the local jail for booking. To this day I don’t know why he left us with Brian’s keys. From the time the officer pulled us over it had been approximately 20 minutes. My roommate and I had an, “oh so bright”, idea.

(Public Service Announcement: This is a good time to mention that this took place several years ago. At a time when DUI’s were only just beginning to become a serious offense and driving under the influence did not hold as serious a punishment as they do today. We were young and very stupid and I do not condone anyone driving under the influence of any mind altering substance. In fact, I am extremely happy that none of us hurt anyone that night and that I can talk about this obnoxiousness today. I do not take lightly the danger we put ourselves and others in that night.)

This idea was followed by several ideas that escalated very quickly. You see.... my roommate and I were Military Police Officers. We felt bad that we let our friend drive us home and he got into trouble. With an extreme lack of judgment and against all of our common sense we decided that we would drive Brian’s car back to our apartment. We didn’t have far to drive but this doesn’t excuse the absolute stupidity that we were acting upon. 

At some point between the time we started driving Brian’s car and the time we arrived at our apartment, my roommate and I came up with a grand plan of how to get Brian out of jail. This was a multi staged plan and I will break it down:
1. Get Brian’s car back to our apartment.
2. Brush our teeth and put gum in. 
3. Shave and get into our Military Police Uniforms.
4. Attach our guard belts to our waist so that we looked like we were on duty.
5. Call my precinct on base and inform the dispatch not to call the jail that Brian was at. (Every night my command would call every jail in the area to check for military members so that we could take custody of them) I knew who was working dispatch that night and that person just so happened to owe me a big favor. I made it clear that I would not explain why I was asking dispatch not to call this specific jail. Dispatch agreed not to call. 
6. I called the jail Brian was at and told them that I was my command and that I was checking to see if any military members were in their jail. They stated “Yes” and stated Brian’s name. I asked if it would be okay if we come and take Brian into custody. They said “yes”. 
7. Switch cars. Leave Brian’s car at our apartment and drive one of our own to the jail. 
8. One last pep talk and walk out the door. 
We arrive at the jail and it’s around 4am and very quite, no other cars in the jail parking lot. We go to the jail entrance and ring a buzzer. A corrections officer speaks to us through an intercom system. I speak into the intercom while looking into a camera and I inform the corrections office that we are there to take custody of Brian. They said “okay”. 

It took about 25 minutes before we heard anything further and as you could imagine we were scared out of our minds and it felt like an eternity! It felt like the exact fear you would feel if you were trying to break a friend out of jail! Then without warning a loud buzzer sound goes off. The large thick metal door in front of us slides open and on the other side we see two corrections officers.... and.... Brian in handcuffs. I’ve never personally see a ghost but at that moment I knew what a persons face would look like if they ever had seen one. Brian’s jaw dropped and his face went extremely flush, ghost white! I greeted the corrections officers and told them I will put my handcuffs on Brian so that they can have theirs back. Before doing so I turned Brian around and gave him a pat down. I swapped the handcuffs and.... that was it, I had Brian in custody!!! 

My roommate and I thanked the corrections officers and we turn and walk away with our hearts beating out of our chest! We are walking across the parking lot to our vehicle when my roommate whispers to me, “don’t get in the car, don’t get in the car”. At that moment a police officer walks up behind us and looks us dead in the eyes then asks us, “arn’t you two the passengers of the vehicle I just pull over tonight?”. It was this moment that our hearts stopped and so did our breathing. 

Like I said, the parking lot was empty when we had arrived. No one inside or outside of the jail had caught on to us. It just so happens that the arresting officer arrived to the jail while we were in the sally port waiting for Brian to be released to us. The arresting officer was just sitting there doing paperwork in his patrol car in the jail parking lot as we walked Brian out of the jail and to our car. 

I’m sure you can guess what happened next. Yup, we all got put in jail. About 8am our command actually came and got us. We got back to base and they told me to go home and that they would call me when they needed me and to get my things in order because this was not going to go over well. I did just that and then arrived back at my command 24 hours later and I did not leave for 45 days and then we were deployed again so I never got off base again during that stateside stay. 

I was punished to the fullest extent of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the military law. I was a disappointment to many people because of this FU. I felt ashamed and I took my punishment. All the while I was the most famous person at my command. I represented what it was to have your fellow military personnel’s back 100 percent! Everyone heard about this attempt to break Brian out of jail and we were practically celebrities. To this day I can not figure how in the hell I had the stupidity to try and pull this off! I am proud to say that this did not ruin my military carrier and that I did get to serve out my enlistment and be discharged honorably. Needless to say I have never FU this bad ever again in my life! The military absolutely did not condone this behavior but in some sort of way we were looked at as the most loyal friends a person could have. Our entire command had comradery like never before. It was crazy, insane, and stupid. However, like many other stories from my youthful years in the military, it’s funny to look back on and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with my brother in arms. Even if we did FU some times. Like breaking someone out of jail.... for a minute. 

TL;DR: My buddy got a DUI, I was drinking with him and in the car when he got arrested, I was a military police officer. 2 hours later I broke him out of jail by impersonating an on duty MP (one of my many convictions). The officer that arrested my buddy recognized me in the jail parking lot after I had taken custody of my buddy. We both went to jail. I almost ruined my military carrier but now many years later I look back in awe of my stupidity and the time I tried to break a friend out of jail."
kx1pia,TIFU by sending fan mail to Marvel Comics,31847,0.93,455,2021-01-14 14:00:46,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kx1pia/tifu_by_sending_fan_mail_to_marvel_comics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kx1pia/tifu_by_sending_fan_mail_to_marvel_comics/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So  this happened in the mid 90's.  Spider-man was knee deep in the middle  of the clone saga, one of the most controversial story arcs in comic  history.  As a 12 year old kid, I loved it.  And after reading the  latest issue, I decided to send a letter to Marvel.  E-mail was not as  widespread back then, so I printed out my letter and my mom took me to  the post office to send it.

A few  months pass and I'm reading the latest issue of Spider-man.  I turn to  the letters page and what do I see but my letter, complete with my full  name printed on the back page of the comic book!  ""They printed it!""  I  told my mom.  My dad was in the room and he asked what was going on.   Now, I love my boomer dad very much.  He's an immigrant who isn't fluent  in English and this was where the confusion started.  I told him how I  sent a letter to Marvel a few months ago and that they printed it in the  latest issue.  Now, something was obviously lost in translation because  my dad thought that I, at the age of twelve, had written and  illustrated a Spider-man story, sent it to Marvel and got published.  He  asked me several times, while looking through the comic book, ""you did  this?  You really did this?""  I said, yes, excitedly, not knowing that  he was referring to the story and not my letter.  ""My name's right there  at the back, see!""  I was referring to my letter, but at that point my  dad took it to mean that I was credited by Marvel for my work.

My  dad was so proud.  A few days later I noticed that my comic book was  missing.  It turns out that my dad took the comic with him and was  bragging about me at work.  ""My son made a comic book!  He wrote and  drew everything!""  I was clueless of all this but there were a few red  flags that I should have picked up on.  For one, my dad held on that  comic book like glue.  He would look through the pages at night.  I  would also get complimented by people at his work ""there's our little  Picasso"" and so on.

Then one  night, my dad asked me if I had sent anything else to Marvel.  Thinking  that he meant fan mail, I said no, I haven't sent anything since the  last one.  He told me that I should make another one.  He starts talking  to me about my ""talent"", if I want to go to art school, if Marvel paid  me etc.  It was at this point that I realized what actually happened and  how bad it had gotten.  My dad honestly believed that I had written and  illustrated an actual Marvel Comic(I have done a few sketches but  nothing close to professional work).  At that moment, I did not know  what to say.  He seemed so proud, that I was afraid he would be  disappointed if I told him.

""They did pay you right?"", he asked

""What?""

""They paid you, for the story.""

""No.""

""What?!?  They're ripping you off!  This is professional level work!  Is it because you're too young?""

""Dad, I didn't write that story""

""But you told me a few months ago that they printed it, you're name's right here!""

I  then explained to him that comic books have letter pages at the back of  the issue.  Fans send letters and Marvel prints them there.  I sent a  letter months ago and they printed it.  That's why my name was at the  back of the book.  My father scratched his head, and from his face, I  could tell that he was going through a TIFU of his own.  He picked up  the comic, flipped to the back and, with his limited knowledge of english, read my letter for the first time.

He  then starts laughing to himself, in a ""wow I really fucked up"" kind of  way.  I tell him I'm sorry and he tells me no, it's his fault.

We  still laugh about it to this day, and it's an amusing story to tell  over dinner.  My dad still kept the comic book with him though.

EDIT: I won't tell what issue it was as my real name and address were printed along with the letter.  Also, don't freak out over their printing my name amd address.  Personal data security and doxxing just weren't things back in the 90s.  There was no social media back then and e-mail was just becoming widespread.  It just wasn't a big deal at the time.

TLDR; TIFU by sending fan mail to Marvel Comics and getting it printed.  My dad reads it and thinks that I wrote and illustrated the story, and ends up bragging about it to his friends and coworkers."
xr9hey,TIFU by accidentally teaching my roommate's parrot to sing CBAT. My roommate doesn't know yet.,31819,0.82,1642,2022-09-29 20:07:00,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/xr9hey/tifu_by_accidentally_teaching_my_roommates_parrot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/xr9hey/tifu_by_accidentally_teaching_my_roommates_parrot/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,True,False,False,"**Bird audio hyperlinked at the very end**

I am so dead. My roommate is out of town camping until the end of the weekend and he's going to kill me when he finds out.

Ok, so we all know the story with [CBAT](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/), no need to go into that. My roommate is out of town for a week, and I have the whole apartment to myself. Four days ago, I (29m) asked my gf (29f) if she would like to enjoy some delicious fun time while blasting CBAT. Her and I are both super weird, and are open to doing this kind of dumb stuff. To no surprise, she laughed and said yes. I just thought it would be funny to experience. To my surprise, it really wasn't as weird as I thought it would be. It might be that the love I have for her is so powerful, that it left only about 5% of my brain power focusing on the dolphin sounds in the background.

The next day we decided to go at it again, only this time CBAT was a surprise for her. After a few minutes of kissing, I turned on the music and we both started laughing hysterically before getting it on. I even lasted longer than the day before, which I now regret.

Here's the problem which I stupidly did not even take a second to consider. While my roommate is out of town, I'm taking care of his parrot who dwells in our living room, which shares a very thin door with my bedroom. This is no ordinary parrot. This is a chattering lory (same bird as that red one on youtube who goes ""wuewuewue""). This bird does not shut up. He makes so much noise that I've naturally learned to ignore him after a year of living with it.

Anyway, somehow it never even crossed my mind that these parrots learn words and sounds and mimic them surprisingly accurately. Before leaving for work yesterday morning, I made some coffee and sat down in the living room for a bit just relaxing and closing my eyes. All of a sudden, I hear the first few notes of CBAT in perfect pitch and rhythm. I opened my eyes and this little dude is staring me dead in the face. 5-10 seconds pass, and I hear it again. I just grabbed my things and left for work immediately. I had to escape, figuring I'd just find a way to fix this or explain this later. But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I'm just dead. My roommate isn't weird like me and he hates when I say silly things to the bird. When he comes back this weekend, I'm worried he's gonna give a notice and leave.

Any advice on how to go about this would be greatly appreciated. I'm sweating as I'm writing this.

And no, for privacy reasons, I will not be posting a video of the bird.

TL;DR I tried intercourse with my gf twice while blasting CBAT just for the experience, and my roommate's parrot learned the song. My roommate doesn't know about this yet.

EDIT: When I get back home from work today, I will sit by the bird and record audio.

EDIT 2: Hyperlinked CBAT above for those who haven't read the story.

EDIT 3: [Here’s the audio you skeptics](https://voca.ro/16NdnZIFs0d4). Enjoy CBIRD. God help me."
ceklgz,TIFU by using the FaceApp everyone’s been raving about,31743,0.88,1029,2019-07-18 04:58:48,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ceklgz/tifu_by_using_the_faceapp_everyones_been_raving/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ceklgz/tifu_by_using_the_faceapp_everyones_been_raving/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So I guess this is a bit of a change from your normal TIFU posts but I felt like sharing anyways.

So this just happened like an hour ago. I’m sure you all have heard about the “revamping” of the FaceApp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

Anyways, so I saw someone post a picture to their Instagram and that’s how I heard about it. I knew I had to download it and try it out...because why not?

So I download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

And OMG I’m totally old lol. It’s kinda crazy, and I’m not gonna lie...I look good as an old dude.

I decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. We start comparing pics and wonder if that’s how we will really look in the years to come.

Then a thought pops into my head...

Everyone tells me I look just like my dad, and if that’s true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! So I send it away!

...Nope.

He isn’t excited, and he isn’t laughing. He said it freaks him out.

I asked him why, and assured him it’s just a harmless filter.

What he said next broke my heart.

“I know I’ll never see you that old.”

TL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck.

Edit: Whoah!! Did not expect this response. Thank you strangers for my first gold!!!

Edit 2: Thank you for my second and third gold!!! Wow."
lb5qlm,TIFU and now I have to hide my leg from my husband for a week or more,31676,0.91,1014,2021-02-03 02:06:44,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lb5qlm/tifu_and_now_i_have_to_hide_my_leg_from_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lb5qlm/tifu_and_now_i_have_to_hide_my_leg_from_my/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I’m a teacher. A kindergarten teacher. And I should know better. 

Right now, for some reasons, Kindergarten is on Zoom. I teach from my dining room table, because it is the best space with the best light. Unfortunately, there’s a big sliding glass door in my dining room and it’s not one of those fancy double pane insulating ones, either. Oh, and I removed the curtains months ago because I wanted all that sweet, sweet sunlight to illuminate my sweet, sweet teaching. So it’s kinda cold. My feet are always freezing. Last night I  asked my dear husband to please bring in the space heater from the garage, so I could put it in the dining room to warm my piggies during Zoom Kindergarten. 

Now dear husband is really a dear, and I love him and he loves me. But. BUT. Sometimes he’s a bit of a nag and a worrier. And the space heater lives in the garage because he hates it - always concerned that I’m going to burn the house down or the cat will set herself on fire. Still - because he loves me, he brought it in. And because he’s a worrier and a nag, he reminded me this morning to keep it three feet away from furniture, upholstery, and the (currently nonexistent) curtains. And for god’s sake be careful. And because I love him, I waited until he was out of the room before I rolled my eyes, tucked that bad boy under the table, and fired it up. 

Now this hot beast cycles on and off. It was getting me nice and toasty while we reviewed rhyming words. My feet stayed warm while we read “The Mitten” and cut out animal pictures. It shut off for a while when we were watching a Scholastic Magazine video about arctic animals, so by the time we finished my tootsies were feeling the Arctic Chill. I pulled the heater in just a little closer. The cat was into it, too. I mean, I take full responsibility but we were in this together. 

About halfway through Measuring Length With Linking Cubes, I felt like my legs were maybe a wee bit to hot, so I tucked my feet back under my chair. We wrapped up with a Jack Hartmann video “Count to 100 and Exercise” and about an hour ago I waved the kinders off for their asynchronous work time, and got up to make myself some tea. Of COURSE I turned the heater off. I’m careful like that. Plus, the cat was sitting closer than she probably should have. 

But as I sat down with my cuppa, I noticed a stinging sensation just below my right knee. I pulled my pant leg up and kids, I was shook. I have angry red splotches on the front of my leg, and the beginnings of a blister. It is not pretty. And now that I look at it, it kinda hurts, too. 

Folks, be careful with your space heaters. It was 3 feet away from anything combustible EXCEPT for me and the cat. She’s fine, but I’m slightly flame-broiled. 

And I am NOT telling my husband. He would be kind and sympathetic and he might even resist the urge to say “I told you so” but he would never never forget. So I’ll be wearing knee high socks to bed for a while until this heals. I’m an idiot. 

TLDR: TIFU (yup, today) by broiling my limb on a heater, and now I have to hide it because I, a grown-ass woman, can’t bear to see my husband’s pitying look and read the reproachful “But I WARNED you!!” in his eyes.

Edit: Sincere thanks to all who showed concern & gave treatment advice. It’s several hours later, and the blister is about the size and shape of a large sunflower seed. I have about 6 similarly sized livid spots below it, and one a little larger. The total amount of injured skin is probably just over a square inch. I’ve treated it with aloe and Vitamin E. 

I’m sending the heater back to the garage. The cat will be disappointed."

I cannot even try to make an excuse for how I could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.

I got pretty close. I donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then I proceeded to get distracted by some forms I had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.

I got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. As the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat I gladly walked over to do so. I began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment I thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. Nope, nothing there. Luckily I never fully took off my jacket.

I proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. I got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.

I didn’t want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. So I then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.

Silver living is they let me reschedule. So now I have an interview for later this afternoon. In about an hour.

TL;DR Left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property

EDIT: I think the job interview went well. I appreciate everyone’s encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.

I’m also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.

And to the people who are/ are now afraid of coming to their work places ‘naked’: I’m sorry! This was also a latent fear of mine too, and the stuff of my nightmares. I can’t believe it actually happened and that ‘checking for pants’ will now become part of my routine."

So my appartement door is right next to the front door. I was laying in a T-Shirt and shorts on my couch, no socks or anything else. So i take this box for my neighbor and boooom my door closed because of the wind. I had no keys, no phone and no socks.

That's when this amazing amazon driver stepped up. First he tried opening my door with a card. Afterwards he let me call my parents with his phone. Then he insisted on driving me to their house to get a spare key. I wanted to give him a tip or something, but he drove away the second i stepped out of his car. My hero.

This is where things got weird.

As I slapped her ass in the heat of the moment, she bursts out with “yes daddy, spank me harder!” (To preface I knew she had some serious daddy issues)This initially was a turn on, but after a few seconds all I could think of was disciplining my daughter and my face went sour. I stopped immediately and felt awkward. She responded with “what’s wrong daddy, did you not punish me enough?”

I walked out of the room and told her I needed a minute. Now I don’t think I can ever have sex again. 

TL;DR slapped my wife’s ass, called me daddy, now I can only think about disciplining my daughter and don’t know if I can ever have sex again

Edit: so this my biggest post ever and it’s about my wife calling me daddy… lord help me.

Anyways, we talked about it and she was really embarrassed and I told her it just surprised me and I wasn’t prepared. We agreed on sir 😉"

My fiance and I have been eating Keto for the last 3 months. She recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. I saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because I hadn't used one yet.

I proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. I threw it in the blender and glugged it down. I thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. It didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

Smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as I'm watching TV, ""Hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" SMH. My fat ass thought it was food. I suppose I should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 Stars, would eat again.

 TL;DR I ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto ""fat bomb"" because I'm a fat ass."

Today after my bf called and I didn’t answer he told me when I picked up his next call that my voicemail was “funny”. I was pretty horrified because I didn’t even remember what I could’ve possibly put as my voicemail since it’s been so long. Kinda assumed it was the default “leave a message at the tone”... it wasn’t. My voicemail has stayed the same cringey greeting for over 6 years: “hey guuurl how you doin? You called?? Leave a message bruh”. I can’t imagine the potential employers and god knows who else who have listened to my voicemail and probably thought wtf who is this kid. 

Needless to say, wtf middle school me. The embarrassment I felt re-listening to what I thought was so cool and funny back then hit me hard. Never again cringey middle school voicemail. 

TL;DR: found out my voicemail has been the same cringey one I used in middle school. Embarrassment has commenced."

Obvious throwaway to not dox myself.

Background: I work in IT for a rather big school. We're the only school for that education level in the whole state (happend in Europe but so you can better imagine the size of the school). As IT we have to do tasks from other areas too - including managing the system responsible for the speakers and announcements.

School ended on June 19, they basically just opened the school to give the students the opportunity to say goodbye to each other. On the first week of summer break there where only a few teachers still there, preparing stuff for next year, organizing their stuff, cleaners and so on.

In the week of June 29 no body - really nobody - was there except me. Everyone either took vacation or ""worked"" from home. So last Friday I thought it would be funny to meddle a bit with the system for the announcements. What's the funniest thing you could do over speakers? Right. Soviet Anthem. Funnies \*\*\*\* I've ever seen. Or so I thought. '50 indicates that the lesson has finished and students have a break and should go to the next class, '00 announces start of the next lesson. I replaced both with the soviet anthem, had a good chuckle and went home.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I went in back again to upgrade a few servers and I was surprised to have lots of cars on the parking lots - including those with military number signs. As soon I entered the building the janitor saw me and then I learned that I massively fucked up. As my country had rising number of corona-cases again the government decided to put up a taskforce. To maintain social distancing of 2m (or 1.5m) they needed big rooms. Well, we have big auditoriums. And the military who also acts as civil defence (don't know the word for it) was involved. Since people from all across the state came and had to help the local hospital and other tasks they decided that they have all meetings in the auditoriums. And the military can sleep in the empty classrooms (to reduce the number of people sharing one room). I mean it made sense, we even had many showers that are intended for emergencies next to the chemistry labs.

They got blasted with the soviet anthem twice per hour between 07:00 and 17:00. They didn't liked it. The janitor tried to contact my boss at the beginning of the week but my boss cut him off before he could explain (""something's wrong with the speakers, "" ""I'm on vacation and nobody is at school, don't annoy me!"").

Many speakers got disconnected, they couldn't disconnect those in the classrooms. I feel terrible for those who worked night shifts and had to endure while trying to sleep.

I disabled it and apologized for the inconvenience. Everyone I saw was pretty annoyed.

Boss will be back on Monday and I'll have a lot of explaining to prepare.

tl;dr: Replaced the school announcement system with the soviet anthem without knowing that state government and military will use the school during summer break.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards but please don't give me awards. Not only is this a throwaway account , I would prefer it if you donate the equivalent amount of money (even if its just 5 bucks) to a local organization, either helping people who lost their job due corona, animal shelters and so on.

So obligatory this didn't happen today but sometime around 5 years ago.

I (19M) attended a high school about 20 minutes by car but having a younger sibling and both parents working more than full time, I had to get myself to school. The train was the easiest option, with no school buses running close to my place. The train was taken by students from many schools, who for some reason or another always seemed to be cooler than me and my mates, so I took every word they said as gospel. One day I was on the 20 min train ride home from school, and this guy was telling some (I now realise, likely bullshit) story of how he sprained his hand. He recounted to us younger lads how he was fingering some chick and she sneezed, supposedly contracting her whole body and getting his fingers stuck inside, now sprained. Now, being the horny af 14-year-old I was, I thought this was fuckin hot. I had discovered porn but for the most part liked to wank by myself and my own imagination. 

Here's the problem. Being a 14-year-old, socially awkward Christian boy who went to an all-boys school, there was little in the way of imaginative content that came my way, so I latched onto this. Most days, for several months, this would be my imagined content for my night-time masturbation. In essence, when wanking, I thought of sneezing.

One day, I don't even remember when, I STARTED sneezing. I had no idea why, not understanding the implications of what i was doing at all. Now, five years later, I still sneeze without fail, even when thinking of being horny and in turn, any sneeze I have turns me on. I bet any future wife of mine is in for a big surprise.

TL;DR: wanked to a bullshit story about sneezing, now I sneeze when I'm horny and horny when I sneeze

Edit: I thought I should add after the comments I've received that I genuinely had no idea about the genetic link, and so I spent 5 years convinced the above story was the cause of the sneeze. Thank you Reddit for your infinite wisdom, I no longer worry about the power of my own brain."

I was actually getting dressed and ready for working at home today. 

My husband was working in our office and let me know he would be on a phone call. He also asked me to make him a smoothie before he had to leave to go into the office for a bit this morning.

I was in the middle of fixing my hair, naked as I had just gotten out of the shower. But I knew he had a busy day and sometimes forgets to eat so i wanted to make sure he ate and was ready for his busy day. 

I go and make the smoothie, still naked as I'm in the middle of getting dressed! And bring it into him not realizing he was on a VIDEO conference call. 

I sat it down on his desk and he just turns to me with the most scared look on his face and pushes me away. I then realized I was butt ass naked on his camera in front of his CEO, my brother who also works with him, and a whole team from India. 

They all saw, we will get shit for this for a while. I'm going to go crawl in a hole forever.

TL;DR: I walked into my husband's video conference naked and they all saw.

Edit: when I say getting dressed, I mean getting ready. Just to clear up any confusion.

Edit Pt II: everyone seemed to laugh it off, brother gave me shit, hubby is okay and laughing, all is well."

&#x200B;

So for Christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. Hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. I loved it! But after a while, being the absent minded person that I am, mine goes missing. ""No biggie"", I said to myself, ""My wife is staying home today, I'll just take her thermos to work."" So I fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.

This particular day was rather busy, and I had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. I had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when I realized I needed to run to the urination station. So I dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.

While sorting the papers at my desk, I reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. Immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. ""This coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. Also I don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. Also what is this texture??""

At this point, still mid-gulp, I shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and I notice a very large floating blob of mold, which I had just taken a sizable chunk out of. Also I notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.This was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. Oh no...I thought as I immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. So I run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. I just knew I was going to get deathly ill, but actually I didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Took my thermos to work, forgot about it. Took my wife's to work a few weeks later. Accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:  My apologies to anyone I made chunder this morning!

Edit 2: For clarification - I just borrowed my wife's thermos, filled it with fresh coffee, and took it to work. Hers wasn't the moldy one. Mine was, as it had been setting at my desk for a month."

Well, he suddenly starts speaking welsh and flinging his arms around, apparently having some sort of an argument. Ive never heard welsh before and tbh, it sounded more like lots of slurring. 

I legitimately thought he was having a stroke so I grabbed the steering wheel, he did the exact same thing but in the opposite direction, he out strengthed me, we span around on the road and came to a stop. 


He was so confused as to why I randomly grabbed the wheel. I explained the situation and now his welsh family and friends are having a great laugh at my mono-language self.

ckl79p,TIFU by finding my GF's porn videos and confronting her about it,31392,0.71,2804,2019-08-01 13:08:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ckl79p/tifu_by_finding_my_gfs_porn_videos_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ckl79p/tifu_by_finding_my_gfs_porn_videos_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"This actually did happen today and I'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


Basically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.


Last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


I loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking ""Oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


But once the fucking started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. This wasn't a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


I checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant porn dicks. My girl wasn't as innocent as I thought. She was a porn starlet.


I was so fucking torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


I then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn't do anything so I went to bed again.


I woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor's office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over. 


After the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. ""What the fuck are you talking about???"". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


I fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but I couldn't find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. They didn't exist.


Now I was just fucking confused. I tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?


And that's when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


So here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we're good for now.


TL;DR: Had a very realistic dream that my GF was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a Doctors office taking STD tests for diseases I don't have.


Edit: OK Holy shit this blew up overnight. I can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so I'll try to break it down by groups that I see most frequently commenting.


For everyone saying the relationship is done: Surprisingly not. She took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. I'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as I thought it would.


For the conspiracy theorist: Nah, the videos don't exist. She didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal PH page there would definitely be at least one re upload. I checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and I trust my GF so I'm fine on that note.


For the ""YTA"" crowd: Yeah I know that's why this is on TIFU and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.


For the ""sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic"" crowd: Sex work is a real job and I'm not contesting that. I also don't care if my partners body count is as long as Troy Polamalu's hair, or as short as OJ Simpsons prison sentence. What I got mad at was that she was CURRENTLY banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. Obviously it never happened but that was what I was mad at, not anything else.


For everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn STD tests work: thanks. Now I know I guess?


Also shout-out to the one guy who thinks it's fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. Can't find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle."

It's a lazy Saturday morning and I'm chilling in bed a bit longer than normal, browsing reddit and just hanging out. My cat, approximately 12 weeks old, is somewhere (but not currently bothering me, so it's okay.) While laying in bed, apparently by myself, I am stricken with the urge to fart; being a single mid twenties guy, I think ""better let 'er rip"" and thus began my morning from hell.

The instant I rumbled the mattress, I felt a mass rush up under the blankets. Unbeknownst to me, my cat was laying under the blankets near, but not touching, my feet; he must have heard the thunder down under and panicked.

It is important to note that when I make my bed, I tuck the blanket beneath the mattress; it's a holdover from Marine Corps days. Well unfortunately for all involved, the blanket was still tucked on the side the cat was laying on. The poor baby had no way to escape the gas chamber. As a consequence, he panicked. And what do animals do when they panic? That's right, they bite and claw.

My cat, probably choking to death, thus began to try and dig his way out. Not through the blanket, oh no. He tried to multitask and punish me for my sins by trying to dig right through my back. He clawed and bit so hard he started drawing blood. Now we are both panicking, and I ripped the blanket off as fast as I possibly could; too little too late for him, as he now has Post Traumatic Stank Disorder, and too late for me as I now look like I fought a very disgruntled family of raccoons. He leapt from the bed and turned to give me the DIRTIEST look I've ever seen a cat give a human being before sauntering into the bathroom, where he remains as I type this.

TL;DR thought I was alone in bed, farted, and dutch ovened my cat. Cat panicked and absolutely mauled me. Now we're both upset.

I am a perv. So is my fiancée. It's a pretty nice yin-yang thing except we're both yangs. We make crass jokes fairly frequently, like to phone bone and are adamant memennials (it makes her cringe, had to write it).

Anyway, we've been living apart for a while as we finish college. The last couple of months have been a little rough for us though. I have been hit by not one but two different hurricanes and have not had power or internet until today. On top of that, my program is all gas no brakes. I've had back to back, to back, exams and have had practically zero interaction with my fellow Yang.

Today, I managed to finally gain access to the internet and was able to see her for the first time in what felt like forever. This was an exciting moment to say the least, and I wanted to make the most of it. But how would I do it? Yang didn't know I had internet access yet, so I had a couple hours to ponder and prepare before nightfall. I turned off the lights, lit a few candles and placed them on my desk. Opened my laptop and tilted the screen to the optimal angle and began the call. She answered the phone excitidly, and I greeted Yang with wang while shouting **LAUGH** as I slapped my jimmy dean on the table, thus initiating our romantic rendezvous. Perfect execution. Delivered the package with more gusto than those FedEx drivers in the pornos. But here's the fuck up. There was laughter. Too much laughter for one Yang and one wang.  It happened to be one of her friends birthdays and they were gathered around her phone to say hi. Her face was red, my boner was dead, and the call ended faster than my hopes of getting head.

She texted me after, freaking out. Telling me that we'll talk later. I appologized because I figured she would be alone at the time. She said her friends won't leave her alone now. I'm pretty sure they're all drunk. Her friends keep sending me small dick memes.


tldr: Slapped dick on table for funny sexy time, got laughed at by her friends and am currently getting more small dick memes than a jockey private detective.

Update: Holy shit guys...thought my alarm was going off...but no it’s just this post is blowing up at 4 in the morning! Thank you all for the awards and comments. It’s been a pleasure reading them and it is honestly just a great all around experience. But none of you care about thanks! I’m not as small brained as you might think. I know why you’re here. You have questions, I have answers.

1. Let me hijack my own post real quick. The city of Lake Charles really got hit hard by these hurricanes. Pretty much the entire southwestern portion of the state suffered heavy damages. What has been shown in media isn’t comparable to what it has been like in person. So, please show some love to the area if you can!

2. Yes, Jacksepticeye’s famous LAUGH meme was the inspiration behind my mating call. Maybe one day he’ll read this and think about my di...wonderful use of the English language.

3. Her friends sobered up and stopped sending me memes. Honestly think they might have just ran out for the time being. Yang calmed down and laughed about it. She said that her friends were just busting my balls because got a full view of them. I was not nearly as amused.

4. Lastly, as far as size goes, I will not confirm or deny anything. My fiancée and unfortunately now her friends will be the only ones privy to that info. So I’ll play the proverbial cocktease. But all good teases have to please at least a little. So, I’ll leave you with another silly rhyme. 

Is it big or is it little? Something huge or a tiny skittle? Long, hard, short...uhm...hard. Thicc like a tire or thin as a card? Honestly it doesn’t matter, work with what you have, and give them a good splatter.

m06nkh,TIFU Taking my kids to see Inside/Out right after getting separated from our marriage,31334,0.93,1038,2021-03-08 08:53:32,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m06nkh/tifu_taking_my_kids_to_see_insideout_right_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/m06nkh/tifu_taking_my_kids_to_see_insideout_right_after/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This happened last Thursday on the first week I had my kids after getting forcefully separated from my wife.  In the span of two weeks, I slept in hotels, friends campers, signed a new lease (on life and a house), purchased a bunch of divorced guy furniture from Craigslist, went to court to stand trial and negotiate a settlement, barely interacted with the outside world and never really contemplated the entire sudden fiasco entirely.  I was just trying to create a new home the state would deem worthy of my seeing my kids.  Last Sunday (2/28) was the first time I got to see them for a week at the new house since the break up.  It was rough, brutal, and confusing for everybody involved for the first few days, but we found a rhythm by Wednesday.  That day, I received an email from a local venue about restarting showing movies in their outdoor seating area during the day since the weather had improved considerably.  Just enter your name and those attending with you and win a chance for 6 tickets and a table to watch the movie in mid-afternoon.  Being the new single dad, I wanted everything and signed up and we won, not knowing that everyone who signed up actually won because they needed to generate business since no one had been to the venue since fall.  The contest was a ploy that worked wonderfully to draw folks out.

SPOiler for plot of Inside Out: I'd never heard of Inside Out before because we normally don't attend movies, but watch some netflix.  We show up right as the movie is beginning, order a pizza and wait and watch.  Nothing fancy, then I realize its a movie about emotions that occur after a huge tumultuous break up in a girls life when she moves from the mid-west to California.

Long story short, they comb through the child's entire psyche, reaching all the way back to her childhood, core memories with her parents, joy, sadness, anger, etc.  Tears are streaming down my face as the buzzer lets me know the pizza is ready.  I walk over, grab it and head back.  We are silently munching through our pizza when the forgotten memory rocket ride scene takes place. In it, the emotion,  Joy, and Bing-Bong, the childhood imaginary elephant friend of the protagonist, are trying to escape a pit of forgotten memories.  They are riding an imaginary wagon that is powered by rocket rainbows fueled by singing.  With both of them, its too heavy to make it up a cliff and out to save the main character.  Bing-Bong decides at the last minute to eject himself from the wagon to make it lighter and sacrifice himself so his friend, the main girl, can find happiness again.  I couldn't hold back any longer and straight up wailed and cried so loud other socially distanced tables were looking over and holding their kids close to them. I tried to stop, but 15 years of marriage, two kids, soccer games, schools, vacations, deaths in the families, secret handshakes, whispers, brownies, sunday drives, and beach trips overwhelmed me and everything flooded out at once.  It was terribly embarrassing for me and my kids.  I couldn't hide it or stop it no matter how hard I tried.

Just then the wind picked up and blew the pizza box, plates, napkins, water bottles and coloring books off the table and strewn them across the venue in broad daylight.  The movie is blaring, I'm bawling, my children are confused and crying, and everyone is frantically trying to help me pick up my life.  Luckily, my son, in the middle of the entire fiasco, walks over to a nearby table, stoops down and picks one of our pieces of pizzas off the pavement and removes some trash from it before taking a bite, then turns around looking at me and yells Dad, pick me up one of those waters off the ground will you!  It was the comic relief every table needed and everyone broke into laughter.  We slumped over to our table and finished the movie holding each other and rocking back and forth.  We had not addressed the situation fully at that point, but the ride home was insightful and we talked a great deal.  I still have a lot of work to do and relationship repair, but we are headed in the right direction.

TLDR; recently separated, brought kids to see Inside Out, broke down in front of everyone processing the recent events of my life.

Edit: Thank you all for outright recognition of my situation through posts, messages, awards and generally reading it.  What you all have shared has inspired me to keep going and in some perverse way belong to a great family toiling away everyday in hidden pain that I am now in tune with.  I've always kept everything at a distance, possibly to avoid this pain and perhaps that is what I contributed to the dissolution of my marriage among other behaviors and not getting help sooner. I have done good things, I have helped people before on r/depression who have reached out and made community contributions around town.  I just needed to be seen and heard today. Their mother is great, she is going to be fine and I am going to continually support everything they do because I'll be right here about a mile from their house they could walk over if they wanted to.  You can believe this.

I can assure you this is real and it happened, I'm real and nothing is fabricated. Yes, I contributed to the break-up, but that's not what this is about.  I made sure to rent a house in the same town near their school in order to maintain presence in their lives and minimize the turbulence. I cooked all our favorite meals the first week to make it seem like it was the same and slept on the floor with them the entire week since I took the week off from work. It's just a post about crying uncontrollably in public unexpectedly. That's it.  Just like my life blowing up before my eyes, I never expected this to either.  I am grateful for all of you reaching out, even those banging me for posting and asking for sympathy points.

I know I can do this because so many of you said it could work and that you also did, suffered far worse, are deep in it right now, and shared incredible stories about making connections with your parents because of it.  I am grateful, really, today is my actual birthday in real life and I've been sitting here reading posts and dying all over again.  I'm lonely, but not alone.  Thank you all. I will pay all of your gratitude forward.

I am truly  sorry for misspelling Inside Out in the title, I fixed it here, but everything seems hyper vigilant right now."
hhg62u,TIFU by leaving my room window open and nearly costing my 2 year old brother his life,31294,0.92,1217,2020-06-28 20:50:25,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hhg62u/tifu_by_leaving_my_room_window_open_and_nearly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hhg62u/tifu_by_leaving_my_room_window_open_and_nearly/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"For context, we live in a 8 storey flat on the 3rd floor.

So earlier this afternoon, I (16M) was minding my own business in my room on my phone. The past few days have been very hot where I live (around 30°C on average), so I left my window open and didn't shut my door. My baby brother was playing with his toys in the hallway and didn't seem to have a care in the world. My mum called me to prepare lunch since she was quite ill so I obliged.

So I was busy boiling the pasta and making the sauce when my gut instinct told me to just peek out to the hallway. I checked and he wasn't there. *Probably watching TV or something*, I thought and I didn't think much of it. I was about to return to my duty when I froze in my tracks.

You ever get that sick feeling that twists your guts so hard you know FOR A FACT something so horrible and catastrophic is about to happen? In an instant, I found myself teleporting right outside my room and there he was by the window. He somehow used my bed to climb onto the heater and sit down near the edge of the window.

The upper half of his body was dangling out and he was busy throwing his toys and being fascinated at how far they can fall and break. He was THIS close to falling to his death, crushing all of his fragile bones.

Without thinking, I quickly grabbed him and put him out of harm's way and I started hugging him tight while cursing myself repeatedly. My mum was oblivious to what was going on the entire time. I shut the window, closed my room and sat him down with me while I resumed making lunch. I was in shock.

My brother could've died today. All because of one stupid mistake I've made. Even though I've saved him, I still feel sick and disgusted at myself and this whole incident is playing on loop in my mind currently.



**TL;DR: Made a huge mistake leaving my window open when I was asked to make lunch, brother somehow got to the window and nearly fell out.**

qavyv9,TIFU by smelling my feet and ending up in the ER,31283,0.89,1902,2021-10-19 02:35:41,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/qavyv9/tifu_by_smelling_my_feet_and_ending_up_in_the_er/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/qavyv9/tifu_by_smelling_my_feet_and_ending_up_in_the_er/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This TIFU actually happened today! Or at least in the last 24 hours, either way I’m counting it. 

I’ll be the first to admit that my feet are sometimes a little bit smelly. Some of my friends and family have lovingly said they are “odorly challanged”. I wash them in the shower every day, I’ve tried the fancy creams, but none of it seems to really help and I’ve at this point accepted that I’m just naturally a stinkfoot and will live my life with a constant faint corn chip aroma wafting from my toes.

I live alone, and when in my apartment prefer not to wear socks or shoes. This is occasionally a point of contention with my girlfriend, who visits often and insists I at least wear socks when she comes over. Its mostly fun banter where she teases me for my feet smelling and I tease her for a loud burp or something like that, but sometimes after a particularly long day the foot factory releases emissions that would surely get me fined by EPA, which she rightfully hates. 

Yesterday she came over for dinner. It was a nice day so we decided to get delivery from one of our favorite restaurants and eat on the balcony. Well, I’m at home and I’ve already liberated my tootsies from their foot prisons, and I figured it’d be nice to set the table with some flowers for my lady. I was outside setting up when she arrived, and she came outside to greet me. IMMEDIATELY she smelled my feet and recoiled in disgust. The most dramatic reaction ever. Fake vomiting, fake crying, she was hamming it up as part of our banter. I HAVE gone a bit nose blind to them over the years, so I lean against the railing to balance and go to smell them myself to see how bad they were. This was my mistake. I’m a burly guy, and this poor railing could not handle my equally overdramatic reaction of throwing my head back and screaming. It gave way.

Luckily I’m only on the second floor, so I only fell maybe 25 feet, but it felt like it lasted a solid minute. It was at least long enough of a fall for me to reflect on the situation and feel like an idiot for dying from smelling my own feet. The aftermath is a fractured rib and dislocated shoulder, and my girlfriend never letting me live this down. 

TL;DR: smelled my feet, railing went yeet, almost died and I feel like sheet.

————————

Edit: Okay guys, I appreciate the foot health advice but please stop PMing me weird remedies. I’m not going to pee on them or soak them in a tomato-bleach medley. I will go back to to the doctor though once I’m all healed up!"
jr30vv,TIFU by powdering my husband's balls,31283,0.84,2651,2020-11-09 23:51:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jr30vv/tifu_by_powdering_my_husbands_balls/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jr30vv/tifu_by_powdering_my_husbands_balls/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago.

My husband and I have been together for 13 years. I have no idea how this started really, but I've been powdering and rubbing his balls for years now. It is just something that we do. It's weirdly comforting and puts us both to sleep. Plus, who doesn't like freshly powdered balls instead of gross swamp balls? Not to mention the wonders it does for chafing.

Anyway, one day I can't find the powder for our 2 yr old's butt. No biggie. I go to the store to get more, but I figured I could get Man powder too. A nice smelling one that just smells like... Man. NOT the after work gross man smell... this is what we are trying to get rid of my dudes. So I get a new powder for him and just regular ol' Johnson's for the baby. It'll be a nice surprise for when he comes home since he's been working out of town.

Here's my fuck up...

I DID NOT READ THE LABEL PROPERLY. I saw that it said ""Absorbing. Cooling. Refreshing."" I saw that it said ""...odor + wetness control..."" and just thought of how awesome it would be for him to not have swamp balls. Being a bit of an airhead, it did not occur to me to read further into that.

So fast forward a few days later to when husband finally comes home from working out of town. Night rolls around and we're in bed. My husband asks for Powder and Ball Rubs. After a full week, without his wife to powder his balls for him, I say ""no prob. I got you, boo."" I bust out the new Men's Essentials Man Powder. It smells good. I dig it. I turn around to put it away and he asks me what I put on him. I turn back to him and can see he's clearly uncomfortable. I look at the label and see that the cooling effect comes from menthol. Now, I feel awful at this point, but honestly, I can't stop laughing. He's complaining its like IcyHot so I tell him to take a shower and see if that works. He hops in the shower and washes his balls. Nope. He is still feeling it. I'm still laughing at my poor husbands predicament that I created by trying to buy him something new for his balls. I ended up using the Johnson's on him, but he was still uncomfortable. I felt pretty bad about it, despite laughing like a hyena the entire time.

That night he said I should post this here, but I wanted to surprise him so I've waited. I do still powder his balls when he's home. I am going to stick with Johnson's Baby Powder though.

Babe, if you are reading this, I am very sorry for causing your balls discomfort, but it was so damn funny. I love you. Sorry for being an airhead some times.

TL;DR TIFU by powdering my husband's balls with powder that made him feel like he had IcyHot on his balls.

&#x200B;

Update: First of all, those of you who awarded my weird and wholesome post are the real MVPs here. I humbly thank you. When I made this post, I had no idea it would blow up like this. Made my day reading most of these comments, but then again the comments are usually where its at. Some of you really need to broaden your horizons and just caress those balls because they need love too. My husband does manual labor so yes he gets shweddy balls. He showers and asks for powder. I have had his penis in me, had his children, I really don't think touching his balls is that far out there. And you all have opened my eyes and educated me on the dangers of talcum powders. I have been looking at new things to try instead of J&J Baby Powder. I thank you for that and I'm sure my husband's balls will too. "

These visits are awkward from start to finish... The hype yourself up to be able to leave the house, the play-it-cool conversation before taking your pants off.. and oh god, the cleaning beforehand. Pretty sure I've discovered a new layer of skin from all the scrubbing. Pubic hair? What is that. 

So, enter the doc's office. Awkward prelims, tick. Pants off, tick. On the table (please tell me this piece of disposable paper has been changed since the last patient) MY ASS IS VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW

Fast forward to the speculum *shivers* now it's just silence. Silence and this guy, just having a stare off with my lady taco. After a few horrifying silent seconds, I decide it would be a good idea to make small talk. (only god knows why) Clearly out of creative ideas, I blurted ""a lot of cobwebs up there"" 

The doc stops moving and chuckles awkwardly.. after what feels like an eternity he says, ""not having an active sex life then?"" 

AWESOME. NO. I MEANT THE CEILING!!! YOUR CEILING. NOT MY VAGINA. *Crawls into a hole and dies*

For some reason he thought this was way funnier then I did. So yep. Should I change gynaecologists, can't bear to 'face' him again.  😅😅

Edit: obviously I can understand he was just being a professional and was concentrating on his job. That's why it's a time that  *I*  fucked up. 😂

Edit 2: thank you for silver/gold kind strangers!!

Edit 3: oh good lordy my inbox. The state of my ""ceiling"" is fine, thanks for your concern 🙏 also yes, I told him he misunderstood me and we laughed about it. Also, you guys are the best. 

TL;DR told my gynaecologist he needs to clean his ceiling more often, but actually it was his mind that needed cleaning. 😉"
f7rqs6,TIFU by asking an unmarried couple how they had the same last name.,31258,0.93,1114,2020-02-22 17:38:43,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f7rqs6/tifu_by_asking_an_unmarried_couple_how_they_had/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f7rqs6/tifu_by_asking_an_unmarried_couple_how_they_had/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"TIFU ... with the obligatory this happened a few years ago but I still experience the gut wrenching feeling of sticking my foot in my mouth every time I think of it. 

So I used to be a wedding photographer and sometimes people get married at the courthouse then have a friends and family reception at a later date. So they are technically married when I first meet them. 

One day... I'm having a consultation, they bring a child, maybe 8 years old, and we put him in front of the office tv while we talk. Again not uncommon for courthouse marriage couples to already have kids together.

The meeting goes well and they write me a deposit check. The check has both their names on it and the last names are the same. 

My brain does maths and I figure... Joint checking account + same last name + kid in tow = they are already married so I say...""You two are prepared, you already have new checks printed with the same last name."" To which the bride to be replies... ""I'm kinda still married to his brother."" And she ended that story with ""...most of his family doesn't approve.""

I was mortified and tongue tied not knowing what to say next as we continued to plan a wedding between this little boys Mom and his new ""Uncle Dad"" as he watched cartoons in front of my TV.  

TL;DR ask couple if they were married as they hired me to be their wedding photographer and the answer was no, she had the same last name because she was still married to his brother.

gpd6fm,TIFU by using the same zoom link twice and catching my music teacher jerking off.,31240,0.94,843,2020-05-24 03:06:55,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gpd6fm/tifu_by_using_the_same_zoom_link_twice_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gpd6fm/tifu_by_using_the_same_zoom_link_twice_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory this happened last night. Also obligatory, I’m an adult male, and I’m 100% sure this was an accident. TLDR at the bottom. 

So I’m taking online piano lessons with a teacher that I’m well acquainted with. They’ve been going smoothly. I’m already used to zoom because I finished my semester of school on it anyway, and I figured this would be a good time to reunite with my instrument. 

we switched up the times for the recurring lessons a week ago, and that caused some confusion as to when last night’s lesson was to begin. He sends me a zoom link and a text at around 5pm and I thought the lesson wasn’t until 5:30pm, so instead of texting him, since I was sitting there giving all of my assignments a final practice run through anyway, I just clicked on the invite link and opened zoom to ask if it would be okay to wait thirty minutes. He says it’s fine, so I leave the meeting and close out of zoom. 

I spend the next twenty-five or so minutes practicing, and decide, “eh, close enough,” and open the email with the same link again. What’s the harm in being a few minutes early? 

This is where the fuck up happens. 

I figured he’d have closed out of zoom as well, but apparently, he’d just left the meeting running, but had forgotten about it. He must have been viewing another window. But his webcam didn’t know the difference, of course. And as soon as I connect, I’m greeted with a spectacle I can’t immediately make sense of. 

He’s standing up in front of his computer, the camera cutting him off right above the neck, and right below the waist, so all I can really see is his torso, but his hand is below the camera, and he appears to be...jerking it? My mind does a bit of an acrobatic feat for a moment. He knew I was logging back on within the next couple minutes. Maybe he’s just Fucking with me. 

So I say “hey, man!” And he doesn’t respond. His hand just keeps going just below the cutoff of my view (thank god), but that’s when I notice, just at the bottom of the camera, where his shirt ends, it’s just skin. And the control panel at the bottom of the screen isn’t so much cutting off the action as it’s merely blurring it, and it’s all skin color. He didn’t reply to me, so my audio must be going through headphones he’s not wearing, and if he doesn’t have zoom open at the moment, he has no way of knowing I even signed on. So I just leave the meeting. 

I sit there in silence with my jaw dropped for a moment, wondering what I should do. I paid for this lesson. I want to keep taking them. Is this even a big deal? Can I just... get over it? Make like it never happened? Should I even tell him? 

A minute later, my phone buzzes. He’s texting me that I can go ahead and join the meeting again via the same link. Oh, don’t I know it. So, I hold my breath, and click the link again half expecting to be faced with another display of masturbation, but no. He’s just sitting there with pants on ready to begin the lesson. 

So I put it out of my mind, had a very productive lesson (though the thought reoccured to me a few times), and as soon as we are logged off, I VERY carefully turn everything off, and burst out laughing. I saved this laughter up the whole time. I couldn’t stop laughing for five solid minutes. 

I couldn’t decide if I should tell him or not, but no. I think not. To me, it’s just funny. Really funny. I can handle the hilarity, but if I were him, my humiliation would be beyond reckoning.

TLDR; rejoined a zoom meeting a few minutes early and caught my music teacher jerking off."

bfh4m9,TIFU and my son ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing penises.,31196,0.9,905,2019-04-21 02:40:00,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bfh4m9/tifu_and_my_son_ended_up_thinking_santa_clause/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bfh4m9/tifu_and_my_son_ended_up_thinking_santa_clause/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"So my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. She opens the door and goes, “Did you say something about Santa Clause stealing penises?”

I reply, “I didn’t say any shit like that. I would NEVER ruin Christmas.”

Here’s how we got there:

I have two daughters and a son. My son was 3 or 4 at the time. He refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. My daughters weren’t having any of it and were like, “This is your department, old man. Do something.”

I tried to reason with my son and that just didn’t work. I was thinking that I needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. He’s a tiny kid. He’ll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

That’s when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. That’s it. He loves his dick. I love MY dick. Me and my penis are tight. 

So my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. I look across the table and go, “Hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can’t go to sleep cause you think there’s something in your closet?”

Hesitantly, “... yes.”

“I didn’t want to scare you but you’re old enough to know now.”

His eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. She’s 4 years older. 

I go, “There’s a goblin that lives in your closet. And if you don’t do what you’re supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you’re asleep and steals your penis.”

He incredulously responds, “NAH AH.”

I reassure, “Oh yeah. What do you think happened to your mom and sisters?”

At this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. She’s holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

My son was dead silent. I could almost hear him thinking, “Damn... they don’t have dicks.”

So where does Santa Clause come in?

After I told my wife I would never ruin Christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, “You must have done something really bad for Santa Clause to steal you penis.”

My guy confused Goblins with Santa somehow and thought Santa Clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

Fear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of Santa and pics of goblins from the movie Labyrinth. 

TLDR: Tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing dicks.

Everyone was having a good time and I was ranting, loudly, to my friend about how so many guys had struggled to take my bra off. I don’t have huge breasts. I wear a standard 2 clasp bra so I was annoyed when guys fumbled around with it. Sometimes they couldn’t even get it off and I had to take it off. Then I decided I needed to try it myself so I yelled “John come here. Let me put a bra on you so I can take it off and see how hard it is”. I ran upstairs to get one of my nicer bras that I usually wear on dates and put it on him. I struggled for a while and then realized it was a lot harder than it seems especially since I’m doing it at a different angle. I had to eat crow and now I’m fully impressed when a guy can get my bra off with one hand, or even at all. And don’t mind when guys can’t get it off and I have to do it myself because that shit is hard af.

TL:DR- bitched about guys not being able to take my bra off. Put my bra on someone to show how easy it was to get off and failed to do it"

Put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. I had a busy night, but at the end of the night I got to see my boyfriend. Totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. I have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an IUD, so between that and my busy day I totally forgot I had a tampon in. 

We wake up this morning and I remember. My stomach drops. I immediately go to the bathroom and I can't feel it. Its gone. I tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything I could think of. Nothing. After close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the Vagina Gods, I accept my fate. This shit is GONE. 

At this point I'm worried that I'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. I also know the risk of contracting TSS if I keep it in much longer so I know I need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. After class I'm off to our Student Health Center. I go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. I strategically timed it so that I WOULDN'T see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, Gen Med, at night once a week. I wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so I was hoping the nurse could do it. 

Nurse is very nice and reassuring but says I have to wait for the doctor. Great. Some time later I'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. He comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing I wanted. Really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

He starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
Dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
Me: "".........""
Dr: ""Theres no final in Gen Med!""
Me: ""..oh""

I for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. Don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

He finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. I have his class in a few days. Not sure how I'm going to look at him. I'm a 4.0 student and I've never felt more stupid in my entire life. 

TL;DR: forgot I had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. Had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. 

Edit: i was dumb enough to say ""stupider"" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. Its been a long day, ya'll. 
 
Edit 2: turns out ""stupider"" was fine. Lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. Also, take your tampon out before sex. 

Edit 3: wow, I didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. Thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. 
For those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. It was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. 
Thanks for the supportive messages, I didn't realize this was such a common problem. Makes me feel a lot better, lol. "

I thought my wife must have already eaten her's and left the rest for me. She usually doesn't like eating anything sweet, so I was 100% sure it was mine.

My Wife came home two hours later, she opened the fridge and started screaming where her piece of cake was.  I told her that I had eaten it, she burst out crying, wasn't even crying anymore a whole mental breakdown. I told her that I'll go to the grocery store and buy a new one. She just left, took her bag (probably going for a walk.)
My wife doesn't actually behave like that, I'm not sure if it's because of the hormones (pregnancy etc), she started getting annoyed at little things, like me eating too loud. She kinda scares me ngl. I went to the grocery store and bought her a new cake and all of her favorite snacks. She isn't back yet.

TL:DR I accidentally ate my pregnant wife's cake, she  came home and cried.

UPDATE:

My Wife came home 1 hour ago, as I said I bought her favorite snacks(Healthy Snacks) and put them on the table. She apologized to me, went into the living room, and saw the suprise. All of a sudden she was like a little angel, having the biggest smile on her face, and constantly hugging me. 
I took a shower, afterwards I was shocked to see that she had eaten all the food, I wanted to say Damn You really ate all that? but luckily I didn't, wouldn't be alive after saying that."

As the title clearly states, I left my portable pink bedazzled vibrator on the ledge of the bathtub. 

Hours go by, I’d forgotten all about it. 

Then it happened. 

**KNOCK KNOCK**

My bedroom door opens and my 10yo daughter is standing there holding my little ol buzzy buddy in her hands stating that my 12yo stepdaughter had found it when she decided to use my bathroom for her bath. 

My Kid: “She said it was some weird massager thing”

Me: “Yep, it is! Thanks for returning it!”

[my kid awkwardly walks away leaving door open]

My SO: “Babe, you must be embarrassed! That’s so embarrassing!”

Me: “SHUT YOUR GODDAMN WHORE MOUTH, IM POSITIVELY MORTIFIED”

Stepdaughter: Walks past our bedroom at the speed of a fucking disabled sloth with a devious grin on her face. 

She locks eyes with me. Proceeds to wave and walk past the door without ever losing eye contact. 

Stepdaughter has done this now 4 times. 

I’ve been informed she sent a photo of it to her BFF to identify what it was. *They know.* 

I’m packing my bags and moving to the fucking moon.

TL;DR left vibrator in bathroom. Kid found. Kid returned. Kid is now silently judging me. I’m moving off planet."
1018yre,TIFU when I made a Reddit post about my break up that became popular on TikTok,31053,0.81,4232,2023-01-02 15:29:59,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1018yre/tifu_when_i_made_a_reddit_post_about_my_break_up/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1018yre/tifu_when_i_made_a_reddit_post_about_my_break_up/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"For the record, I have no problem with this post getting downvoted or buried.

Yesterday one of my ex's friends contacted me. She said she got my number from my ex. Made sense. I blocked and deleted my ex's number since our recent break up, so if my ex wanted to continue communicating with me, she had to get creative. Hence, the friend. She said my ex wanted to meet for coffee and clear the air. The friend made it sound like my ex was really sorry for what she did to me. My head was telling me to save my energy and avoid meeting my ex at all costs, but my heart was telling me I used to love her at some point and maybe hearing her out would be the adult thing to do. I decided to ignore what my head was warning me not to do and agreed to meet with my ex. 

My ex and I saw each other this morning. It became very clear very quickly that she had no intention of apologizing for what she did during our break up. She wanted me to know that she found my Reddit post on TikTok. She showed it to me. It got a lot of attention. She reminded me how she had to find out from another person that I was planning to end our relationship and now she had to find out on TikTok that I shared our private life with strangers on the internet. I said well at least I didn't go down on a random girl moments before kissing someone I supposedly loved. My ex said she involved another person (the guy whose dick DNA was in my mouth) because I invloved another person (my friend that I spoke to about the break up before the break up). 

I got frustrated and said I guess that made us even. My ex disagreed. She said if she wanted to get even, she would have to post her side of the story on Reddit or TikTok. She was saying that to low key threaten me, but I didn't care, she didn't scare me, not until she said she might ""accidentally"" refer to me by my name and surname and username on social media. I said nothing would stop me from making the same ""mistake"" and dropping her real name too. She said ""challenge accepted"" and dared me to drag her name through the mud so she could do the same to me, but apparently worse. I called a time out and asked what the fuck she wanted. She insisted that I created another post. You're reading it right now. I was instructed to type the following words from her verbatim: 

""I kissed you after sucking someone else's dick to teach you what someone with balls actually tasted like because you obviously had no balls to tell me it was over between us. We're both to blame for the bad break up, but I blame you for most of our relationship problems because you were under the impression that being an introvert meant I was in charge of communication. I confessed to sucking another dude's dick when I was done making out with you... and guess what? I was still doing all the talking! I'm not perfect, but at least I told you what was going on instead of keeping my mouth shut."" 

""You can hate me all you want for using a random guy with a random dick to hurt you. However, you've been using me since the beginning of our relationship. I was good enough when you wanted to lose your virginity and enjoy all the perks of having a girlfriend, but as soon as you became more sexually experienced, you realized relationships actually required work. I'll admit, I'm a lot of work. But so were you. Dating a virgin guy with literally zero relationship experience meant I had to take the lead in and out of the bedroom, which wasn't always easy and enjoyable, but I did it because I believed you were worth it. I was wrong. You're just a little boy with a big appetite and a small stomach. Fun fact, you didn't make me cum as much as you think you did."" 

The end. There you have it. I'm the bad guy. I've done my part. I agreed to share this post if my ex agreed not to turn this into a name and shame game on Reddit or TikTok or whatever. I guess this is the price I had to pay for sharing my relationship drama in the first place. Fuck up number 1 for 2023. Fml.

TL:DR Told Reddit (anonymously) that my ex sucked another man's dick before she kissed me and broke up with me. My post somehow ended up on TikTok and got a lot of attention, including the attention of my ex, who then confronted me and made me create this follow up post to share her side of the story or else she was gonna reveal my real name on the internet."
lequo6,TIFU by talking about the poop knife non-stop during a job interview,30985,0.91,1305,2021-02-07 22:54:24,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lequo6/tifu_by_talking_about_the_poop_knife_nonstop/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/lequo6/tifu_by_talking_about_the_poop_knife_nonstop/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So I had a job interview today with Reddit. I was on the video call with the hiring manager (HM) and just talking about normal things.

I spoke about my work experience, how I handle clients, how I went about analysing user trends in order to create content strategies - all very professional.

The HM then asked me to put together a hypothetical content plan - what sort of “Reddit-y” content I would show to users that best represented the website. He said to think back a month ago and consider what content Redditors would be interested in.

So, of course, I start talking about interesting and topical events. I mention how in January, everyone was thinking about the upcoming inauguration so I’d surface that as news on a global scale. I’d also then go a bit more local and find interesting content from a user’s country or continent.

And, because all of the current world events can be so heavy, I’d include something light and fun.

Like the poop knife.

As soon as I said that, the HM gave me this look crossed between disgust and confusion.

**HM:** The poop knife?

**Me:** Yeah you know, the poop knife! *(while mimicking holding a knife and then doing a cutting motion).*

**HM:** I don’t think I know what the poop knife is… and it sounds like that’s a good thing.

**Me:** Oh yeah, definitely. It’s a pretty gross story.

You’d think we’d leave it at that but no. I then went on to explain the poop knife story in detail for three minutes, complete with hand actions.

It felt like I was having an out of body experience. I could see myself word vomiting and saying the words “poop knife” over and over. I was willing myself to stop talking about the GODDAMN POOP KNIFE but it was like my brain was locked onto this one topic and I couldn’t think of anything else.

The entire time, the HM’s face got more and more horrified while I happily talked about users cutting up their gigantic poops. Finally, I came out of my daze.

**Me:** So anyway… recently, users found out there was another Redditor who ALSO had a poop knife. Um… and everyone thought it was hilarious that two different people had the same poop knife idea. So… something like that. *(again, while doing a limp cutting motion with my hand)*

I went on to talk about how I’d show inspirational content, funny content, something cute, and other content tailored to the user’s interests. I thought I was out of the woods but my brain was still stuck on the poop knife.

**Me:** And that’s what I’d do! I’d show content from a variety of sources - something global, something local, and something funny. Like the poop knife.

Again, I did the cutting motion - it was like I had no control over my body and the spirit of the poop knife had decided to channel itself through me. I tried to move onto other topics but the damage was done. The HM still had this look of utter confusion, doubt and disgust on his face as we both said our goodbyes and tried to move past my shitty stories.

Needless to say, I didn’t get the job.

TL;DR: I was so nervous for a job interview that I couldn't stop talking about the Reddit poop knife story.

**Edit: a few people have asked some questions so to clarify:**

* The role was in content strategy. I had to demonstrate that I understood trends in popular Reddit content and could generate/curate content that would resonate with users.

* I did the interview last Wednesday but this post needed to be manually approved because it contained the word poop.

* I’m not sure if it makes a difference, but I’m a lady, not a dude.

**Edit 2: oh god - we hit the front page and this is now the first post that comes up when you search “poop knife”.**

**Edit 3: we did it. I got a job at Reddit.**"

I should start by mentioning that this is likely a common occurrence. But as it was the first time it happened to me, I totally freaked out. Thoughts of a potential hospital visit for such an embarrassing incident plagued my mind. 

After 6 hours of not sleeping this morning I (26F) decided to masturbate using a tiny 3 inch bullet vibe. I should mention that the vibration is super intense. I can barely stand it. Everything was going swimmingly, till my phone alarm started sounding. It was annoying and I didnt want to wake my boyfriend so I popped the vibe just inside my vagina for a moment, trying to avoid getting lube all over the bed. Little did I know this was a horrible idea. My vagina turned into a vaccuum like critter and sucked that fucker up in seconds. 

While vibrating. 

After about 5 minutes of fishing for it and panicking I hobbled out to the living room where my boyfriend was napping to beg for his help. Turns out it was hooked on my Nuva ring and turned slightly. He was eventually successful in retrieving it, but only after he stopped laughing and saying I told you so (he warned me about this exact scenario when buying the toy). 

TL;DR
My vagina vacuumed up my bullet vibe and my boyfriend had to fish it out

Edit: it happen again. With a butt plug. While my boyfriend was at work. Fuck me."

I had resigned that there was something wrong with me: probably an old head injury, cancer, new onset of autism, too much tiktok, unchecked ADHD or some other mental illness that would never get fixed. About 5 years ago, I was prescribed amphetamines and even went to  a therapist that treated the issue as anxiety and learning to live with what I was experiencing through mindfulness. 

It has only been getting worse after 5 years, so I just resigned myself that I was going to die soon and learned to live like this for years while just coping the best I can. This got even worse just recently when I had a seizure while I was waking up in the morning. 

My focus been gradually going to shit with me lacking even the most basic ability to follow movies or what people were saying to me in conversation. I even worked with someone that would once told me “I don’t know if there’s something in your head that the words don’t catch...” but she was right. I couldn’t even follow the most basic ability to listen to others or read paragraphs from a page while retaining the main idea. 

The other day, during my morning coffee routine, I decided to take a magnesium citrate vitamin that I found in the medicine cabinet just for fun since it mentioned nervous system support on the bottle.

I cannot begin to tell you the un-fucking-believable difference that happened in under 6 hours. It felt like someone rewired my brain into functioning again. 5 years of brain fog is nearly completely gone. I can follow conversations and follow what is being written down like I did 5 years ago. I did the same thing again today and I feel mentally healthier than I’ve been in over half a decade. I have a new outlook on life just because I curiously rummaged through the pill cabinet.

TL;DR: Resigned myself to dying young, but then I fixed 5 years worth of worsening focus with a magnesium citrate vitamin.

*EDIT: please consult a doctor first if you think you are going through something similar. There are many possible reasons for poor focus. Also, magnesium overdosing is a thing, so don’t rush to the drugstore to down a bottle.

*EDIT2: [Here is what I swallowed for anyone wondering.](https://imgur.com/gallery/h3z3Pi0) and the front page? Hi mom!

*EDIT3: (UPDATE: 24 days after this post). I’ve been taking magnesium, vitamin D, D3, and a daily men’s multivitamin intermittently over the last 24 days. After a screening, it turns out that the only outstanding issue presently identified clinically was a 

*Vitamin B12 deficiency*, 
=
surprisingly. I could have potentially fixed a magnesium deficiency since I felt so much better after taking the vitamins over the last 24 days, but I will never know for sure since I was supplementing while I had to wait 3+ weeks to get tested. It seems more likely that the initial magnesium dose I took in this post had other psychological effects or was entirely placebo to begin with. I have to go and supplement *B12* for a while before I update this thread again with more tests in 3+ months."

17 years ago I passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn't care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". Whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&#x200B;

I was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can't remember what someone said but I replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""I don't have glaucoma"" and I, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, I never said that"". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I'd been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.

&#x200B;

tldr: I found my parent's weed stash when I was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, I believed them for almost 2 decades.

Edit: this was my first post, thank you so much for the flair!

Edit 2: sorry for those saying this is made up but I really was (am) just a huge nerd/goody two-shoes and was terrified of getting in trouble. Yes my parents were cooler than me and still are and no I didn't appreciate that until I was much older

mspvhl,TIFU by making the doctors think I was a drug mule.,30919,0.93,826,2021-04-17 18:02:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mspvhl/tifu_by_making_the_doctors_think_i_was_a_drug_mule/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mspvhl/tifu_by_making_the_doctors_think_i_was_a_drug_mule/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"This happened last night. My wife wasn't feeling well and I was tasked to make dinner. I made a nice penne pasta with sausage to which I inhaled, It was delicious. Right after dinner I started to have horrible lower back pain, to the point of on the ground rithing and nausea which only progressed worse and worse. At this point I had a feeling it was another kidney stone as I've had them in the past. My wife drives me to the hospital and I limp in, in excruciating pain. I check in, the nurse gets my vitals and then I waited for them to take me back to get a CT at which point I start vomiting from the naisea in the lobby... in front of everybody, and falling to the ground because it hurt so bad (think hot serrated knife in your back combined with the feeling of having your testicle in a vice). 

They finally got me back to a room in the ER and the Nurse Practitioner (NP) that was on came in and confirmed what I had thought, it was a stone but it was stuck mid left ureter (The stone was about 4.5-5mm and for referenc, the human ureter is about 5mm in diameter, so a tight fit) she left to go order my meds. The nurse and her nursing student came in and got an IV catheter placed, antinausea and pain meds on board which helped bring my pain down from a 10 to about an 8. About 20 min later the pain finally went away, completely away, so we speculate that the stone pushed its way though and finally dropped in my bladder.

Now here is where the fuck up happened. When the NP came back in she had a very concerned look on her face. ""There are some concerning things on your CT scan and I'm just going to come right out and ask, do you do drugs?"" I told her no I don't to which she asked when I ate last. I replied about an hour prior to coming to the hospital and that I made penne pasta. She stared in disbelief. Come to find out the radiologist that read my CT was concerned that I was a drug mule. Apparently, if you don't chew your penne pasta all the way, the shapes and gas patterns they produce look very similar to a bag of drugs. I told the NP that I wasn't a drug mule, but rather a penne mule to which she starts to crack up laughing, she left the room laughing and I could hear my nurse and a few of the other nurses start to crack up. The NP came back and said that she had to go tell the radiologist that it was in fact pasta and not drugs, the radiologist also started to crack up laughing. 

All in all, i was able to urinate after thr pain went away, no fever or bacteria in my urine sample and since the stone finally left my ureter, I wasn't in pain anymore so I got to go home. The NP was even joking about putting ""make sure you chew your food thoroughly"" on my discharge instructions. 

tl;dr: if you don't chew your penne pasta fully and need a CT scan, you might be accused of being a drug mule.

Edit: I also have 2 snapshots of the CT which I don't mind sharing if you want to see the stone or what a true penne mule looks like

My husband and I have 5 kids. He works a lot and I stay home with the kids. Our ideal sexy times are at different times of the day (his night, mine afternoon). Because of all of this we don't have sex all that often (something we're both okay with). 

Yesterday was a fairly lazy sunday and we were able to sneak upstairs for a bit after lunch. We were just laying in the bed talking and one thing led to another..and since I am extra frisky during that time of day, we really got into it. I usually try to be quiet (small house, lots of kids) but I was in the MOMENT and I have no idea what sounds may have come out of our room.

Fast forward to us getting dressed and ready to go back downstairs, I check my phone and have 2 missed calls from my oldest daughter (13), a voicemail and texts saying ""Are you okay??"" 💁‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Obviously I was a bit louder than I thought. She wouldn't make eye contact with me for hours after and Idk how to feel haha

TL;DR

I had sex with my husband with all of the kids home, was not so quiet and got worried calls and texts from my kid asking if I was okay."

Luckily I found a guy who was willing to meet up with me that day and we planned to meet for dinner in Seoul.

Then he told me he actually had plans at night but was willing to meet up for coffee. I agreed and we end up meeting a few hours later to grab a coffee. He pays for my drink and immediately we connect and talk for a very long time. He was super sweet and very attentive throughout the whole date. I was surprised that we shared many similar interests. He promised that when I visit Korea again, he'd show me around and made tentative plans. He repeatedly told me he wanted to meet again, which I took as a sign of interest. Since I was returning to Japan, I had no intention of continuing to use Tinder, so I asked for another way to contact him. Since we were in Korea, I figured he would have Kakao Talk (a Korean messaging app), so I suggested that I should add him on Kakao. **First big fuckup.** I added him on Kakao through his QR code, despite never using the app before. Then send a quick ""hi"" message and close the app. After that, I forgot about it and we quickly went back to chatting and banter.

Eventually, it came around time for dinner, but neither of us wanted to leave early, and since he had his commitment at 9:00 pm, he suggested we walk around and grab dinner. I agreed and we walked around the streets of Seoul to find a place to eat. We settled for street food and talked over dinner. This time, I paid for the meal, as a thank you for the coffee, and we head back to the station. But since neither of us wanted to depart, we made one last pitstop, and he decided to show me a Korean bookstore. We were supposed to end the date at 7:00 pm, but we kept on pushing it back as we found new things to discuss, until it reached almost 7:30. It was finally time to go, so we walked to the station together. He told me that he was very lucky to have met me and that I should call him when I reached my hotel safely. We agreed to keep in touch online.

We depart and I get on the train. My hotel was 1 hour and 30 minutes away by train, so 45 minutes in, I decided to spontaneously delete tinder. Since I had this guy on Kakao, it shouldn't have been a problem to delete Tinder right? **Second fuckup**. When I finally reached my hotel around 9 pm, I decided to open up Kakao Talk and message him. I look at our chat log and it was empty. I remember thinking ""*weird, I thought I messaged hi earlier""*, but I quickly dismissed it and tried to send another message. It didn't go through. So I tested another message, and it didn't work. Turns out, I'm partially banned from Kakao Talk because the number I registered with isn't associated with a carrier anymore. This means I can't send messages unless they send the first message. I quickly go into panic mode and try to contact him through other means. However, I deleted my Tinder account, which was my main way of contacting him.

So I thought that maybe I should make another Kakao Account with my Korean number and contact him through there. So I uninstall and reinstall Kakao Talk and create a new account. **Third Fuckup**. Clearly I wasn't thinking, because there was no way to re-add him since I don't have his Kakao ID. So I backtrack and tried to log in to my old Kakao Account and just wait for him to message me first. Immediately, I receive a popup notification *""This account is temporarily disabled""*. I thought the ban only extended to messaging, but apparently, now I can't log in either. I messaged Kakao Support, and they said it would take several weeks to unban me if they don't find anything wrong.

Great, so now I guess I unwillingly ghosted my first date. I really put in the effort to contact him again by trying to find other social media, but to my avail, I had no luck. So I guess I will never be able to contact him again, and the whole date was just one big fever dream of my time in Korea.

**TL;DR** : Went on an awesome first date with a guy from Tinder while I was traveling in Korea. We had an immediate connection. I added him on a messaging service and prematurely deleted Tinder since I didn't want to use Tinder when I returned to Japan. I found out I was partially banned from that messaging service and locked myself out of my account. So there was no way to contact him again. Therefore, I unwillingly ghosted a guy I had great chemistry with.

**TL;DR 2** Can’t contact guy I went on a great first date with because I deleted tinder and messaging app doesn’t work.

Edit: clarifications. I deleted my Tinder *account*, I tried recreating an account, but he’s not there. I can’t rematch with him because I’m back in Japan now and I’m too far. He doesn’t have fb or instagram, I tried. And I don’t have a phone number (to save money while abroad in Japan), so I never asked for his.

Edit 2: Okay I contacted Tinder Support

Edit 3: Thank you to all the kind strangers offering to pay for a tinder gold subscription, but I will try to exhaust all my free options first. Plus I would feel bad accepting that kind of aid!

Edit 4: Tinder Support's response: *"" After deleting your account, your account can't be restored but you can create a new account just by logging into Tinder again.* *If you've deleted your account, you won't be able to get your matches and messages back*.*""* :(

This happened years ago. So, here's the deets. 

A few years ago I met a bisexual dude who was around 25 years older than me. I was 23 at the time. We met through an app similar to Grindr. We meet up, hook up, end of it. Never met again. Around 2 weeks or so later I start dating this 20 year old girl. Things are going ok and about 3 weeks in the relationship we are walking through a park when she stops me and tells me that her dad is there and I should meet him. It's a bit soon, sure, but it's not like formal or anything so I agree. Lo and behold though, her daddy is the dude that was calling me daddy a few weeks back. We both freeze and stare at each other in absolute horror not knowing what to say. We awkwardly shake hands, girl attributes it to nervousness. 2 weeks go by and one day she calls me to meet up. When I get there she is absolutely fuming. Like, I can literally see smoke coming out. She goes off on me about how could I possibly do this to her. I obviously have zero clue what she is on about. She tells me that her dad came clean to her and her mom about being bisexual and told his daughter, my gf, to break up with me so he can be with me. And apparently it was my fault because I was the one that turned him gay. So she throws a plastic container at me and storms off. Never heard from any of them again.

TL : DR I meet up with a bisexual dude for an one off, start unknowingly dating his daughter, dude comes out to his family, gf blames me for turning him gay, breaks up with me

Edit 1 : seriously thanks for the awards guys. Never thought I'd get awards on here.

Edit 2 : in case it wasn't clear yes, I am bisexual as well

Edit 3 : I am a man, not a woman as many have thought. I thought that banging a bisexual dude would make it clear 😂"

I (26F) am a home health nurse and I work with a (17M) patient that is mentally challenged. He is very high functioning but has the mental capacity of about an 8 year old.
Anyway this patient is very fixated on the fact that I am pregnant. He asks me every time I'm with him if I've picked a name and when I'm having the baby. 
Today as soon as I walked in the door to his house he says ""I know you had sex"" I am a little shocked by this and don't say anything. He follows up by saying ""I know that how you got pregnant."" His mom is upstairs so I'm stuck navigating this by myself. (Important to the story) So here's where the FU comes. I said to him ""you're not wrong but sex isn't something you and I should talk about together. It's something you should ask your mom about."" I had completely forgot this kid has an extreme fear of doing anything wrong and took my comment as he shouldn't have said that to me. I thought the conversation was over and done with but then Him, His Mom, and me all get in the car to go to school. 
As soon as we are all stuck in the car together he very nervously yells "" THE NURSE AND I TALKED ABOUT HAVING SEX TOGETHER."" Now, as a nurse I've seen and hears many awkward things but this one takes the cake. I very awkwardly had to explain to his mom the situation and no, I did not talk about having sex with her mentally challenged son. She thought it was hilarious but I'm still mortified.

TLDR: the mom of my mentally challenged underage patient thought I talked to him about having sex together"

So I say. ""I really like your belt it's really shiny"" she smiles and says ""thanks"" so I go. ""I wish I could pull it off"" not thinking that it could mean something else other than I wish it looked good on me. she blushes and looks down and when I finish her coffee she looks at me and smiles and says ""thanks"" so my assistant manager comes over and she's like ""did you just tell her you wanted to take her belt off?"" My face goes red as I realise what I said. I explained it to my assistant manager who just laughed and told me to think about what i say before I say it 

Tl;dr complimented a customer on her belt and told her I wish I could pull it off.

Also I'm married so there is no chance in this becoming a love story as funny as that would be."
9pja3n,TIFU by hiding in my girlfriend’s room while her parents are home,30751,0.85,2027,2018-10-19 17:49:12,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9pja3n/tifu_by_hiding_in_my_girlfriends_room_while_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9pja3n/tifu_by_hiding_in_my_girlfriends_room_while_her/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"As the title says, I am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend’s room. 

You may be thinking she’s here with me, scared to be caught, but she’s not. In fact she’s nowhere near me, because she’s at school.

My girlfriend and I live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. My girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she’s Asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

On Wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. The plan was simple, I would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and I would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

It went great, I made it out, even ran to my car which wasn’t necessary because by the time her dad was coming back I was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

Fast forward to that night and I end up going back over. Thursday goes good, I go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

Now it’s Friday morning. Her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. Then she leaves, I lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where I’ll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

Her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. Fuck. It’s locked. He pauses, turns the light on, I assume he looks in her brother’s room, then tries the door again. Still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. He says something to himself (I don’t speak Chinese but I really wish I did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

I text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared I am to get caught. She tells me to chill, tells me they don’t have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn’t always listen so that worries me.

Pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn’t awake. Now I’m currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because I can’t do anything.

Escaping is impossible. Her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. Going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. Plus I have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

I have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but I doubt I will. Anyone have any advice? She’s 19, I’m 20, her parents don’t even know she has a boyfriend.

I imagine they’ll be beyond pissed if they find out I’m here, we’ll both be fucked. Not only is she dating me but I’m staying in her house without them knowing. It’s scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn’t even know it, I feel bad for doing this but I love my girlfriend and I’m literal melted butter in her hands.

Update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now I have to poop really badly. About 6 more hours to go though. Rip my bowels and my asshole. Also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so I have to be very careful with what I do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

Update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: I still have to poop, not as badly though. However a new probably has arose. I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can’t really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. Hope I don’t throw up because it’s very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. Also think of napping but too afraid I’ll let out a massive fart or make some noise. Girlfriend stopped replying due to class. I’ve given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. The dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. Mom is high level once she wakes up though. Hopefully she’ll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn’t awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

Quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, I think she’ll make breakfast or something. Dad is talking to mom, don’t know what about. Hope they don’t try the door again, really feel like I’m gonna shit and throw up now.

Good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure I can hear her dad snoring. I can finally relax a little. Might actually catch some shut eye. Off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

Okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom’s long gone for sure, dad’s asleep, not snoring but I’m pretty sure he’s sleeping. Unfortunately girlfriend hasn’t answered texts for the last two hours I think. Finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. Every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens I get spooked. I’m glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. Someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. Not really sure how to prove it’s real. As I said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. Hoping it doesn’t come to that. Dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in China so his body is in another time zone. Might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. Thanks for the good luck. See you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

Updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. So far dad’s still asleep, mom is at work, AC still spooks me. Here’s some answers to questions: gf’s birthday is late, yes dad works but “he can’t handle work” so he goes later (around 6 I think?), and I’ll make it clear now I’m not planning to escape, it would be stupid. I truly think gf’s dad doesn’t care enough to try and bust down the door. Also yes, Florida is a Stand Your Ground are but dad doesn’t own guns, just knives (I feel like I could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so I know how to run and fight). To those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then I’d have no problem doing that. As for my poop situation, I still have to go but it’s not that bad anymore. Yes I have a bit or orange and bread left, and I have headphones that are supplying me with some nice Spotify service. Also, I played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. See you in an hour. 

Not really an update but I’ll post link to gf and I’d texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) [proof reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Pv91je) 

Update AGAIN: uhhhhh I didn’t see a post that got deleted. I deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but I uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. If this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? As for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. I’m probably going to watch some YouTube or Netflix, since sleeping isn’t a good idea. I’ll update in an hour as always. 

UPDATE: try using your phone to view. Anyway GOOD NEWS. As we speak I am shitting in the toilet. Dad left. Pooping has never felt so good. I’ll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

Update: girlfriend is home, I pooped as soon as the dad left. Yes I know it’s stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home I’m safe. For those who are asking why didn’t I leave when I got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and I didn’t have my bag packed. There will be one more update after this when I get home, the true safe zone. As for now the girlfriend and I are going to play fifa and chill until I have to leave. 

FINAL UPDATE: hello I am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend’s parents. I have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. About my girlfriend’s age,,, she went to school in China at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she’s making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. She’s not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, NO BOYFRIEND. For those of you saying she’s an adult her parents don’t control her... they do. As long as she lives there and they support her financially. Not to mention she isn’t white... She’s Asian (Chinese specifically). I myself am Italian/Cuban, so the same rules go for me until I move out (planning to before the end of next year).  Many of you ask why I didn’t leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. First off I had to poop so badly. Secondly I won’t see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so I’ve been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn’t need to go to the hospital (mom’s a nurse, taught me everything since I was young). I wanted to be there for her in person. Also yes, her parents own a restaurant. I won’t post anymore updates (99.9% chance I won’t bc it’s over) but will reply to DM’s and replies :)

Final permanent update: yes it’s about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. I’m glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. I’m currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, I’m mentally and physically better than when I did this stupid shit. I will never do this again, and I don’t suggest anyone else does it, I had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if I was the dad and found out I would be beyond pissed. Sorry Mr.Ex’s Dad. Yeah, I hope everyone is doing well, I’m doing better, enjoy your day/night :)



TLDR: currently staying in my girlfriend’s room while her parents are home, doors locked, dad tried to get in, parents don’t even know I exist, no escape route. Also have to shit really badly."

So this actually happened yesterday. I kept getting this puffy tender spot between my P and B after having sex. I, of course, went down a google rabbit hole. Herpes? A cyst? Hemorrhoid? It wasn’t a pustule or clustered so I was pretty sure it wasn’t any of those things. It would start to shrink a little, then grow after particularly excessive days of intercourse. Just to be safe, I made an appointment with my gyno.  She goes through all the basic questions before starting her poking and prodding. 

Eventually she stops, looks up at me and asks how often I am having intercourse. She raises her eyebrows when I say at least once a day (hey, we are enjoying the early stages of marriage). Then she asks if we engage in rough sex and again I say yes. Last, she tells me this can happen from engaging in rougher sex with a man who is *eyebrow wag* well endowed. 

My insurance had recently changed and I have been seeing her for a while, but she was now out of network. (They chose not to tell me that over the phone before my appointment, but whatever). I had to pay out of pocket for the exam, and that my friends is how I paid $75 for my lady doctor to tell me that my husband is hung. I already knew that.

TL;DR my husband has a big pee pee and it was inflaming the bottom of my vag bag which made me think I had something wrong down there.

Edit:
My husband and I are having so much fun reading through your comments! Some of you are getting more upvotes than my post, and I totally understand why.
Let me cover some things:

•I know what a perineum is, thanks. Some of you obviously don’t know what a colloquialism is.
•my husband isn’t intentionally putting me in pain. Would I be taking that schlong daily if I didn’t like it? There’s just some mild side effects from being railed every day. 
•the fuck up is that I paid to be told something I already knew. 
•maybe it is a humblebrag? Sue me. 
•insecure men are coming out in full force today to attack this•a professional would certainly say something like this when you have a longstanding relationship with them. I’ve been seeing her for years
•again with the colloquialisms. I know that penis, vagina, anus and perineum are the proper words

Also: please stop asking me to post pics or dimensions. In the words of Kash Doll: 
“And I never tell a chick about the pipe I get.
'Cause if she ever disrespect, I have to fight that bitch.
You know that beef stick so bomb.”"

Today, after eating a large Thanksgiving meal and partaking in two glasses of wine, I decided to pump and dump. I retreated to an upstairs bedroom, set myself up, and started pumping. 

The fateful combination of baby-induced sleep deprivation, copious carbs, and wine left me feeling...drowsy. As I sat in the rocking chair waiting for the pump to do it's thing I felt myself nodding off. I figured I would doze for a few minutes while I finished pumping and then return to the (Covid-compliant) family gathering in a timely manner. 

No such luck. I awoke over an hour later, clueless as to the length of my slumber, with nipples the size of wine corks emitting sad puffs of dust with each cycle of the pump. Hours later it still feels as though satan himself tried to suck my soul out through my nipples. 

On the plus side, my otherwise latch-struggling baby has had no problems nursing since my nipples grew 3 sizes today. 

TL;DR: fell asleep pumping breastmilk, woke up with giant painful nipples.

ETA: If you're breastfeeding or pumping and do decide to imbibe, please be aware that pumping and dumping does not lower the alcohol content in your milk. I pumped and dumped to relieve discomfort, but only time can remove alcohol from your breastmilk. It metabolizes out, and generally takes 2-3 hours per beverage consumed."

an8yff,"TIFU by trying to edit a headshot without permission, HR is involved.",30723,0.94,1341,2019-02-05 07:02:31,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/an8yff/tifu_by_trying_to_edit_a_headshot_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/an8yff/tifu_by_trying_to_edit_a_headshot_without/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"TL;DR at bottom.

I work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. A portion of what I do is handling the corporate website. One of our mid-level professionals (I'll call her Gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. It's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

Every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. It's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

So, Gina's paper is being published, and I'm called on to do all the marketing around it. This includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

The thing is, Gina's headshot is a little... off.

As a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. Not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

So, I can't exactly call up and ask if I should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation I want to have, and I'm also not known as the most tactful person. I'm very familiar with Photoshop, and use it all the time (I've got no Graphic Design qualifications though, so I'm very slow by comparison), so I go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. I'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

I work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. Still, it's not something I want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, I alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

Lo and behold, Gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. As she comes by, I hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. She comes in and freezes, asks what I'm doing. I say Im just tweaking a picture, and when I look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

She gets louder and asks what the fuck I'm doing fixing her chest area. She then asks if I'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. For some reason, I decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say I'm evening out the skin tone.

She dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

About an hour later, I get an email from HR saying that I need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  I ask if I can speak privately first, and explain the situation. I still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that Gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". I acknowledge that, but also mention that I tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, I'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

We have the meeting, and I had to explain the whole thing to Gina directly. She is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. She's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). She then goes on to suggest that I altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

I then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the HR rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

She's still livid, and HR suggest that I should jump off this project. 

I'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. I told my boss the whole story and he's assured me I'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

TL:DR: Tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and I reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like I'm zoomed in on her breasts. "

Longtime lurker, first time poster and I am posting from my phone so please forgive formatting.

I have just recently arrived home following this FU.  I, a very happily married 36M with a small herd of children have been going to the gym in my little town since November 2022. I always go after getting the kids to bed which generally puts me there around 830pm.  

The gym I go to has two rooms. One has cardio equipment (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes etc) the other room has free weights and various other torture devices.  

My routine begins the same every time with 9.1-9.5 miles on the bike, which leaves me in a state similar to that of a walrus that has just managed to pull himself onto an iceberg, very wet and breathing heavy. This process takes me  to about 8:55 pm.  I enjoy hitting weights at this time because the gym is often (not always) empty and it leaves me to grunt and groan in peace. Tonight the gym was not empty when I entered the weight room.

Now I mentioned that I have been going to the gym since early November. In that time I have gotten used to the people that do spend time in the gym past 9 and this person was new. Not a big deal, she had brought her own yoga mat (the ones in the gym are blue and red and this one was tyedyeish) and she had her phone set up on a stand, I assumed she was making a video. Both of these observations were made as I walked down to my trusty bench to start my bent over rows.

I grabbed my dumbbells and sat down to continue my ritual and TIFU. I always remove my wedding ring before I lift and tuck it in my right sock for safe keeping. If I try to wear it, it digs into my hand and makes things most unpleasant. So I start grunting out reps with ol’ righty and just nicely switched to lefty when I feel a tap on my shoulder. So I stopped what I was doing and turned to see new girl standing behindish me sporting a menacing glare and wielding her iPhone. I popped out my ear bud and asked what was up. The following conversation is as I remember it.

Me: Hey, what’s up?

New Girl: You’re disgusting.

Me: Excuse me?

NG: You saw me in here and took off your ring, planning on chatting me up? (This is a little paraphrased, she swore a little too and I wasn’t taking perfect notes)

Me: What?

NG: You’re gross.

Me: Ok.

I proceeded to put my earbuds back in and get to work while she stormed to the other side of the gym and started packing up her stuff. I watched her head for the exit while I was resting between sets. Anyway, I’m rowing away and out of no where I’m blasted with a cascade of liquid which leads me to drop my dumbbell and spin around to see what’s going on.  There’s new girl with her recently emptied pink yeti screaming at me ( I’m assuming for being gross, it was unclear as I had my buds in still.) I remove my ear buds so I can understand her and she storms away. I think the highlight of the exchange is that my gym shirt now smells like vodka. Do most people drink at the gym? Am I doing this wrong?

I’m home, showered and explained why my shirt smells like I’ve had a raging party to my wife. We’ve both had a good laugh. If I see new girls video on social media I’ll be sure to share it here. I don’t know who she was but it’s a pretty small town so it might pop up. Cheers.

TL;DR I took off my wedding ring at the gym causing a lady I’ve never met before to go bananas.

EDIT: Well this got a lot of attention!  So I had emailed the gym owner last night at the request of my wife. (She feels the same as many of you that this lady could be dangerous to others).  He has already emailed back. Apparently new girl received a ban early 2022 for aggressive behaviour with another gym patron. Owner is going to call me later today for some follow up. 

I will definitely look into the silicone rings, thanks everybody!

EDIT: Final Update. I had initially planned on responding to a bunch of the comments but there are just so many…

Anyway, new girls previous aggression was verbal. The gym owner has deactivated her key fob and placed her on perma ban. He has also called a few of the smaller gyms in the area to give them a heads up (super cool dude).

Thanks everybody for the thoughts and advice. I know I’ve let a bunch of you down by not pressing charges etc. But I also know I have made many of you proud by completing my cardio after lifting tonight. Before I left for the gym tonight my wife recommended a rain coat for protection (she’s the best).

That’s all for now unless the video surfaces.  Cheers."

So I’m prescribed 50mg of Vyvanse, and have been since I was 14. 50mg is a higher dose for someone in my age/weight bracket (early 20s F, 115 lbs) because the highest legal dose is 70mg.


I have a bizarre sleep schedule with a cute sprinkle of insomnia, so some nights I don’t fall asleep until 5am, and that’s what happened last night (this morning). I set an alarm for 10am, woke up around 10:30, took my Vyvanse, laid down for a little bit, and somehow fell back to sleep. 


At about 11:30-12 I wake back up, still groggy. It takes my Vyvanse about 2 hours to fully kick in, so I’m still a little out of it. This is where I fucked up.


I’m so used to waking up and just BEING up that I started my morning routine over again on autopilot. I strolled over the coffee machine, started to make some, and took my dose of Vyvanse. I realized about 10 seconds after I’d taken it that I had already taken it. 


Here’s the thing, I can’t throw up. I’ve thrown up twice in my entire life. So that wasn’t an option. Cue frantic googling. Pretty much everyone says I’m going to be in for a wild day, and to stay hydrated. I try to look on the bright side—maybe I’ll get a lot of work done today!—but I was foolish. 


It’s been 3 hours since my last dose. I’ve peed around twenty times. I can feel my blood. I took one hit from my Juul and transcended time and space. My stomach is furious. I tried to reorganize my room, started to hammer something into the wall, hit my thumb. Cried. Put my clothes in the dryer and then felt like I needed to have them Extra Dry so I ran them again, the lint in there started burning. Cried. All of my whites now smell like Chicago in 1871. 


My body is in fight or flight. I’m so anxious. 30 min ago my mom’s best friend texted me ‘Your parents’ and nothing else. By the time she responded to my ‘???’ fifteen minutes later with the picture of my mom and dad when they were younger that she meant to attach, I had already accepted that I was an orphan and was halfway through an article re: how to deal with the sudden passing of your parents. My cat came into my bedroom and I got scared. I didn’t like her stance or general demeanor. 


Currently, I’m applying for grad school. I don’t know why. I’m not even done with undergrad. But it feels like something I should do right now. 


Anyway. I’ll be fine. I’ve actually done this one other time and ended up being alright, just very fast for a while. Have a good one, all. Take meds responsibly.


TL;DR I took 100mg of Vyvanse when I’m prescribed 50mg, am currently paranoid, distraught, and feeling like I have an IQ of 1000 and -17 at the same time.


EDIT: Holy shit! I appreciate all of the concerns and nice comments lol. I’m doing alright, I’ve had a lot of water and feel 75% normal. Still wide awake, obviously. Hopefully this inspired a few people to use those pill organizers. I just ordered one. Also, I did not finish applying to grad school. I made the amazing decision to take out loans for undergrad in NYC and if I get into any more debt I’ll never be able to afford groceries.

EDIT 2: Again, yes, I did get a pill organizer. Thank you for the Amazon links. My heart rate is still fucked, but getting better. After reading everyone’s replies, I think I’m going to try to lower my dose a little bit—some of y’all’s stories about long-term effects freaked me out. But I’m okay, really!"

We have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with Our Dear Friend Paul from August 3rd to August 4th, 2019. Let me spin you a tale...a tale of Shit River.

4:30 pm

Our initial impressions of the house were terrific! Our illustrious host, Paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. Paul was friendly! Check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. Everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

We return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. We fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. We had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! A few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

After a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. We discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). Plunging half successfully, we messaged Paul and let him know the situation. Only one working toilet isn’t ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we’d make it work!

8:38 pm

The remaining toilet won’t flush. The party grows worried. Paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

Paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won’t be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. A five second Google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in Virginia Beach, but Paul did not want to call them. After “informing” Our Dear Friend Paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. A plumber was found! Magic!

9:30 pm

Raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. Kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. The House likely possessed. Drinks have been drunk like it’s the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or Uber to safety. After all, where would we go? We pray to whatever Eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

The stench. Dear god. The STENCH.

11:20 pm

Emergency plumber arrives with Paul and Paul’s Friend in tow. One of them goes to the roof. One of them pounds a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. We split the party.

12:20 am

Plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for “The Final Blasting.” Paul’s Friend fails to discover how to “switch off his nose” and taps out (“I’m out man, I’m out.”). It’s been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. The backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *For now.*

12:22 am

Paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. Classic Paul! We oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

THE FINAL BLASTING. The Stench. The Horror. The Splatter. We all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

Paul & Co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. He requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. We decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. We also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: The Witching Hour

Lights flicker ominously. The House isn’t finished with us yet…

4:30 am

Paul offers a full refund (excellent). He later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). We ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. He offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

The party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. We take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the Toilet Gods.

11:10 am

We commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. After completion, we agree never to speak of this again. Who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

THE GREAT GURGLE. We hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. Was it the broken spirit of Paul's Friend chugging another PBR? NOPE. The shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

We hasten our efforts to flee. Paul is called. We finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

We convene to discuss departure. Suddenly, one of our party realizes we’ve been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping SHIT RIVER POOLING IN THE HALLWAY. Fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the Rubicon. We form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

Water oozes up from the baseboards. Satan's Septic Tank thirsts for blood. The lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

Our Dearest Friend Paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: “This house is fucked.” Agreeing with Paul's uncanny observation, we flee The House. The smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

TL;DR I trusted my Airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded."
c9qiqq,TIFU by unwrapping a condom,30691,0.91,933,2019-07-06 12:07:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c9qiqq/tifu_by_unwrapping_a_condom/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c9qiqq/tifu_by_unwrapping_a_condom/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don't want this story going back to the IRL me.

So at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

Anyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

As I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.

When I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.

I wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.

TL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. I think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

I think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" I'm also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

The ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

Thank you for the awards, I wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points."

Naturally I offer to make him a drink, to which he replies black coffee. Now, being a clueless, tea drinking Brit, I assume black coffee is a type of branded coffee or something. Can't find it, make him a normal milky coffee instead. Perfect.

I apologise to him saying we don't have any black coffee, to which he laughs - not sure why at the time. I hand over this milky mug of coffee to him and his face instantly shifts to the most defeated look ever. The couple seconds of silence were ended with him saying ""Cheers mate"" in a disappointed manner.

This continued for the rest of the day, every time he asked for a coffee until he eventually went home. Eventually found out it's just coffee with no milk. Can't look him in the eye now.

TL;DR: Gave someone who wanted black coffee milk coffee multiple times without realising it's just coffee without milk

One of these office workers is a (F 18) who we'll call Jess. So Jess was in the factory helping out and I happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. Now Jess and I have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as I was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""You look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(Which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

So me being the master of wit that I am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! If I say the right thing I could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
My brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""I'll finger you""

Not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
Because of the level of noise I  the factory I have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. It just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. Everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
At this point I wanted to just crawl into a hole, but I stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""I meant that as though you're a cow, not that I actually want to finger you""

This seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
I can't look Jess in the eye any more. Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

Tl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response I said ""I'll finger you."" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

That will be funny, soon. Maybe. 
So let's begin our story with an obligatory: This actually happened today. Just a few minutes ago. 
My husband, let's call him ""Steven""  and I were getting it on like married couples do and all was well. I had a one-way ticket to pound town and it was the ride of my life. We're just about to our destination when Steven takes a detour and stands up. He looks at me and says, ""Come here."" I know the drill. This is the moment I've been training for. I get on my knees and start doing my thing...or his thing, really. Before I know it, bam. Our destination is right around the corner. Our ride to pound town has just about cum to a close. The big finale.

 So Steven looks down at me and gives me the look, lifts my chin up, and I open. Now this is where the FU truly begins. I open up my mouth of course but I also decided in the moment that THIS time, I wasn't just going to close my eyes and stick my tongue out. No. THIS time, I was going to stare deep into this man's eyes sensually as he shoots his load into my mouth. I mean, that's a thing, right? Eye contact to show mutual appreciation for the awesome sex you are finishing? Well the real problem was, I wasn't the only one who decided to switch things up. You see, in the same moment I decided to open my eyes and look into Steven's, he had decided that this time he wouldn't just pop that load into my mouth. He was going to let it explode all over my face.

I'm sure you see what's happening here. Which is good, because now I cant see shit. I couldn't really measure it, but I'm fairly certain that 70% of Steven's load went straight into my eyes. I proceeded to close them as if I could squeeze my way out of this problem. Unfortunately there was no un-squeezing what had already been squeezed into these eyeballs. I hopped in the shower, cleaned up, and rinsed my eyes with water, assuming that would be the solution. My eyes felt like they were on fire at this point. I then turned to actual solution. Contact solution, to be exact. I squirted some in each eye and felt my eyes burning from the inside out. Or so I thought. I looked in the mirror to find that I now look higher than every member of the gang on ""That 70s Show"" put together. For those of you that don't understand the effect of doing the weeds, my eyes are bloodshot. Redder the devil's butthole. I've now used some Clear Eyes in hopes that the burning, redness, and twitching of my eyes will soon dwindle away. I'm truly afraid to go to sleep and wake up blind.

 Friends, I just want to say that if you have a Steven in your life, please communicate with him about how and where his loads will be shot. Don't be like me. If you think about being sexy and looking into his eyes while he finishes, I implore you to reconsider. If anyone actually reads this, thank you for being a part of this journey with me. Steven is now sound asleep while I wonder if my eyes will fall out before sunrise.

TL;DR Decided to open my eyes during sexy time trying to be sensual, and got literal eyefuls of cum that have caused immense pain, redness, and twitching. If I go blind tonight, I'll miss you Reddit.

EDIT: 
1) Added paragraphs. My eyes were burning and I've never written a post this long on Reddit using mobile before, so I didn't realize you could still paragraph. Whatever. You get the point. 

2) For you sweet souls asking me how I am, I still have eyes! My eyes still hurt but not nearly as much as before. According to some comments, I made a mistake in using contact solution, and in using eye drops. What can I say? I'm good at making problems worse than they need to be.

3) I know not everyone who reads this will believe that it's real and that's okay. I seriously did not expect more than five people to ever even come across this post let alone thousands. Thank you to everyone who has read this regardless of whether you believe it's true or not. I honestly wish it wasn't. I'm glad you took the time to read about my ridiculous mishap anyway. 

4) Thank you for every award, every kind comment, and message. I knew Reddit was cool but holy cow you guys are amazing and I'm so thankful! You all made my night. Hope you have amazing days/nights and keep cum out of your eyes for all of eternity!"

Nothing worked to bring my blood glucose down. I went to a zero carb diet for a while and, I'll admit it kept me from hitting the 300+ zone, but staying above 250 for that amount of time left me a husk of a man. I was tired even though I slept 12 or more hours a day, I stopped playing video games because I simply didn't have the energy or focus to enjoy them, and sex was a chore.

About two weeks ago, My GP finally said that she would get me an appointment with an endocrinologist. He diagnosed me as type 1 on the spot, did some blood work to prove it, and called my GP ""An absolutely dangerous idiot for waiting this long.""

Now? I haven't had a single reading above 200. I'm eating carbs again. I had my first bowl of cereal in five years last night and my meter read 116 at the end of two hours after it.

So, last night, I felt fantastic. I did my old highschool weight lifting routine, I went for a 20 minute jog, and I had the best sex ever with my wife.

Great, right?

I wake up this morning and notice something. It hurts to breathe. Every muscle and bone in my body hates me.

Learn from my mistake. Don't over do it just because you feel like Superman. You're very much still human.

Waking up to coffee with cream and my wife making oatmeal made it better.

Ok so this happened about two hours ago. 
First of all, a little backstory:
I’m a 25 years old male who lives in Iran which is a very shitty country to live or to be born in. Everything here sucks and is incredibly hard, including finding a job. I have been unemployed since Covid hit my country and just recently i managed to finally find a job. Covid is still raging here, since they won’t vaccinate us, so most times we work from home.

I was dating this girl for about 9 months, which i know isn’t a long time but since I’m leaving the country in a few months forever, i really invested myself into this relationship cause we planned to leave together and everything was going so smoothly. My anxiety was practically gone and i was really happy after a really long life of being depressed. 

Yesterday, out of nowhere she breaks up with me and tells me that she isn’t feeling the relationship anymore and that I’m a really good guy and she doesn’t want to hurt my feelings in the long run. Which destroys me but i understand. I tell her to give us a another chance and she says no, it’s better this way. She’s a very honest person so i believe her and leave. I accept the outcome even tho i immediately start crying.

Anyway, today im still pretty bummed out but i gotta go to the office for a couple of hours and my boss is there to help me which is a big relief since i really didn’t feel like working. I take a smoke break and get reminded of some memories and i start crying a little bit. I go back upstairs and my boss immediately finds out that I’ve been crying and insists on me telling him what happened, which i do.

He looks me dead in the eyes and says ""Wow, you were crying over that? Such a weak person, i don’t think you are a good fit for the compony if that’s the stuff you are worried about. I think you should leave"" at this point i start laughing, cause this is clearly a joke right? right? Wrong. He looked at me like im insane and asked me to leave immediately. So i pack up my stuff and do as im told.

Yesterday i had a girlfriend whom i loved and a job and a good future ahead of me. Now im just a guy who has to leave his country and everyone he loves because he was born in one of the worst places possible and he’s doing it completely alone and broken. Honestly maybe boys should not cry.

TL;DR: My girlfriend broke up with me. I opened up to my boss and he thought i was weak so he fired me.

EDIT: Wow, you guys made my day a million times better!!! I’d give you all hugs and golds if internationally usable credit cards where a thing here and i could buy Reddit coins. But since that’s not possible, I’ll send all my love.

EDIT2: Holyshit, This blew up!!!!! You guys are amazing!!!!!! Thanks for all the awards and kind words. I have learned so much by just reading your replies and i have definitely gained a new perspective on my life. I will cherish your words forever. Also I’m sorry if i can’t reply to all your kind comments. I will try my best to reply to as many as i can. Also also, for people who ask, I’m moving to Germany on a school scholarship and will definitely update you all beautiful people. Much love to all of you."
egrdt2,TIFU by not reading the instructions to an ejaculating dildo,30594,0.79,1330,2019-12-28 20:04:02,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/egrdt2/tifu_by_not_reading_the_instructions_to_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/egrdt2/tifu_by_not_reading_the_instructions_to_an/,self.tifu,0,8,,text,True,False,False,"My girlfriend and I (both female) are quite experimental in the bedroom department and we are familiar with normal dildos, never had an issue figuring out how to use them. It is straightforward and simple with a normal strap on. Well, we started speculating on buying one of these “ejaculating” dildos a couple of months ago and I decided to bite the bullet for Christmas and get her a kinky Christmas surprise - for opening in private of course. I also got this cum-like lube which looks surprisingly realistic. 

So we open it up and obviously want to get right down to it on Christmas Day but due to family commitments we have to put it aside, crack on with the day and we vow to get down to experimenting with it tomorrow night when we have some proper alone time which was Boxing Day evening. 

Boxing Day evening rolls around and we’ve both been pretty horny during the day. The anticipation has grown and as soon as evening chill time hits we proceed to the chill part of Netflix & Chill.

We’re getting down to it on the sofa and the time comes to get out our new ejaculating dildo. We’re both pretty excited as the fantasy has been building for a while. I’m bisexual so I obviously still like the feel of a penis and a load of cum in me or on me, and she’s dominant in the bedroom so enjoys playing that role.

We excitedly grab the box and slide the big boy out. If you’re unfamiliar with what they look like they have a long thin tube attached through the middle of the dildo with a syringe type thing at the end where you load the “cum” in, and then you obviously press the syringe down when you want it to “ejaculate” out of the hole at the end of the dildo. We don’t bother reading the instructions fully. We are firmly in the moment, it is dark and we want to get on with it. 

We are totally new to this but figure how hard can it be!? Here is our first mistake. We need scissors to cut the tube down to size. It was really long and we could make out on the instructions in the dark that we needed to cut it down. We have the background light of the TV on but the main light off in the front room as I’m paranoid that neighbours can see in through the thin curtains so I insist on the main light being off. I’m butt naked on the sofa, shes butt naked and putting the strap on on, and in retrospect maybe turning the light on would have helped a lot in the situation. So we run to the kitchen, guess how much to cut the tube down and hope for the best. It ended up quite short. 

She gets the dildo on, we take the top off the syringe bit which is actually quite large - in the dark - we load it up but unfortunately being amateurs with the ejaculating side of it, we fill it right up to the top of the syringe, pop the top back on and feel we are good to go.

Here’s where it starts to go wrong. I immediately felt when she put it in me that it was “cumming” in me quite violently. I’m like woah, one pump and a squirt is not what I signed up for here. So I tell her to take it out because at this point I am the cream pie. I am filling up faster than town when the Boxing Day sales start. She wasn’t pushing the syringe at all. She takes it out and it’s literally just...... cumming. It won’t stop. 

I turn over in a half horny, half irritated state to try and figure it out and I’m nearly at eye line with the bulging, cumming dildo which then literally ejaculates all over my shoulder and the back on my sofa as I dive to the side to avoid it going in my eye. As I do this, I proceed to knock a drink all over the floor, the throws and anything else that was beside the sofa in my foot line. Great, the dildo is quite literally projectile cumming. My sofa is sticky with this stuff and I’m flailing around holding the end of the dildo trying to stop it and I’m like fuck it, let’s just make it cum all over my tits to get it all out so we can crack on. I was exasperated at this point. 

We try and aim it at my tits to make it a bit sexier in the moment, I’m there with my head back like I’m ready to take a decent load and it literally showers me. My entire torso, my tits, my stomach, my shoulders. It is not like a quaint little load that usually comes from a penis. There is not one area this stuff did not squirt. Once the monster had finished squirting it’s endless load at me, it sounded like it was gently queefing which really helped the sexy atmosphere, as you can imagine. My girlfriend was desperately trying to clean me off a little and just ended up spreading it all over me and essentially rubbing it in. It was gross. I assume the air bubble combined with the overfilling of the syringe contributed to the “difficulties” we had operating it.

We were pretty traumatized by that point. The reality was definitely not the same as the fantasy. We took it off and continued the traditional way. When we turned on the lights at the end, all I can say is it looked like an ejaculation massacre. We’re going to fill it a little less next time and properly read the instructions.

TL;DR - accidentally overfilled our new ejaculating penis, culminating in a cum stained massacre all over me and our front room.


**Edit** - We really did not expect this post to blow up as it has! Truly glad that our experience has given you all some laughter!

In keeping with our tradition of naming our dildos, we have decided that Queefer Sutherland has been born. Thanks for all the love."
dvra7a,TIFU by teaching my daughter to talk,30600,0.88,2198,2019-11-13 18:18:44,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dvra7a/tifu_by_teaching_my_daughter_to_talk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dvra7a/tifu_by_teaching_my_daughter_to_talk/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Actually happened yesterday. The effects are still rampant this morning.  

Grocery shopping with my one year old girl. She’s just the sweetest. Really loves cooking and shopping with her daddy. Is chatty with anyone that will talk to her and waves at literally everyone. 

So of course we’ve been teaching her to say every day words as well as any new ones we think she can pick up on. She’s getting quite the vocabulary for being so little. 

As it goes I decided to grill some chicken and have a nice garden salad for dinner with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I took my little angel to the store with me to grab a few things and when I picked up the balsamic vinegar, I heard a familiar question:

*what’s that?* 

I told her it was balsamic vinegar, which she pronounced “ba salty n-word” I tried to correct her to no avail. Her decision was concrete.  

My adorable little girl is passing out n-words. I’m mortified. She’s loudly and proudly saying her new words.

We scurried out with no groceries/people staring and ordered pizza for dinner. She’s still asking this morning when we’re going to EAT ba salty n-word.

TL;DR tried to teach my one year old to say “balsamic vinegar” she is now saying “ba salty n-word” with reckless abandon.

Edit: her 4 year old brother is now saying it too. One guess who is staying home from pre school today.

Edit2: some people are asking about how she’s speaking so well at a year. She’s actually 13 months old but i detest giving her age in months now that she’s reached a year. 

She talks constantly, asks for things, says please and thank you, knows names for specific toys and items. Asks for specific things to eat. Knows all of our names in our immediate family and grandparents. 

The how is we taught her to speak along with ASL (American sign language), so before she could speak she could ask for milk, or more, or to be changed and a few other things before she was able to vocalize her needs. It’s the best parenting thing we’ve ever done.

Edit3: I’m really enjoying reading all the stories of other kids mixing up words. This post will definitely be saved as a gift for her 21st.

Last edit: I’m pretty sick of some people saying my daughter can’t talk, and that kids don’t speak until 18mo-2years. Here’s a small [article](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-start-teaching-my-baby-sign-language_1368485.bc)  with 5 sources advocating ASL for babies. It helped her develop her spoken words more easily. Don’t be a dick about my kid you fucking don’t know it all shitbags."

She was only there for a week and I hadn't seen her since I was 7/8 so I agreed and thought it would be fun.

Yesterday we went on an early morning hike and I thought we had a lot of fun. She stayed at my house afterwards until she was pretty much forced to leave by me having to go to work. 

It is at this point that I should probably mention I had no feelings for her in any way. I just felt like we had a connection as friends. So i suggested we go with her friend to a bar together in the evening since she was leaving the next week and I thought it would be fun.

Red flag no. 1
I show up at the location and has specified and could not find her or her friend. Also there was a wedding happening at the venue she specified?
I tried calling and everything but she didn't answer. Eventually I managed to bump into her and two friends and they thoroughly convinced me that they were as confused about the wedding as I.

So we grouped up, started chatting and headed to a pub different from our original plan. 

Now I also want to mention that right from the start we talked about how we were going to split the bill. I was going to pay for my beer. The girls agreed to pay for the wine. One of the girls also ordered an expensive meal and said she would pay.

The music was great and the alcohol flowed. I'm not much of a drinker but I had a freaking amazing time. Nearing the end of our time there one of the girls suddenly got up and left. Now this is where I got confused, partially due to the alcohol and partially because I'm pretty trusting. The other two girls explained that they wanted to get a taxi with me back to their place to chill a bit longer before I would head home myself (again, there was no implication of sex or anything and I did not want any).

So yeah... They left me there telling me they were fetching this other friend back...

I'm a student so I have no money either. If I'd tried to pay for their two bottles of wine, my beer and the meal then my card would have declined.

Honestly the only things that kept me from rage was the excellent people at the restaurant who treated me with respect and allowed me to figure out how to pay. Also there was an incredible performing bassist there who offered to help me out until he saw the bill.

I didn't know people were that awful. I couldn't afford it and they knew that because we had talked about my job and how I need to save and pay for my own university tuition. 

The girl who I've known since I was tiny declined all calls and blocked me on WhatsApp. I'm so glad that my father is close with her family because I'm needing to get that money back (my father had to come and bail me out of the situation, bless him).


TL;DR: I trusted someone I thought was my friend and they left me at a pub with a bill that I couldn't afford"

My wife of 4 years gave birth to our first child last year. Both my wife and I are blue eyed and light skinned. Our baby has a darker skin tone. Over the past 6 months his eyes turned a very dark brown.

I had my doubts. My friends and family had questions. I read too many horror stories online.

I asked my wife half jokingly one day if she was sure the kiddo was mine. She starred daggers at me and said of course he is. I let it go for a while, but I still had a nagging doubt.

So right after thanksgiving I told her I wanted a paternity test to put my doubts to rest. She agreed.

A few weeks ago I came home to an empty house. Wife and son gone. On the bed she left the paternity results. And a petition for divorce.

Kid is 100% mine. Now I will only get to see him weekends and I lost the most amazing woman I have ever known.

TL;DR - I asked my wife for a paternity test. She decided she didnt want to be married to someone who didnt trust her."

I work at a warehouse, won’t disclose which exact one but I can tell you it’s named after a famous river.

Anyway, they have a rule here, that if you go over 6 minutes between scans, you accrue “time off task,” if you reach 2 total hours of time off task... you get fired.

I’d just gotten a warning a week ago like “hey your TOT is a bit high, just make sure you’re not spending too much time fucking around.” Now, I need this job, so I decided yk, if I gotta go I’ll just hold it in until my break.

On paper, good policy. In practice, this theory falls apart.

Anyway I came back to work today, and I’ve been having diarrhea these past few days, so I took a shit right as I got to work before I clocked in. Some time passes, I take my break, I come back from break and I got that feeling in your stomach like “oh yeah I’m gonna have to shit soon.” So, I figured what I was feeling was a fart, so I just yk, let it go.

My god. There, in the middle of the warehouse, a small amount of diarrheal shit escaped my ass. I quickly ran to the bathroom, and discovered I was dealing with a large pool of fecal matter.

I was pissed, sad, and just ready to be done with this stupid fucking shift. But, I couldn’t work the rest of the shift like this, so I took one hour of my personal time off, and headed home to change.

Before I went home, however, I had to talk to my manager to let her know I less leaving for a bit but that I’d be back. Naturally she asked why, and as I tried to make up some excuse, a worker from behind me obviously noticed the shit stain on my jeans.

What happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life. I don’t know who, but I heard someone shout “YO HE SHIT HIMSELF.” 

Never been so embarrassed in my life. Everyone laughed, and I submitted my resignation a few minutes ago.

TL;DR: I shit myself at work to avoid getting fired, ended up resigning after everyone saw.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented! I’m trying to read them all but I’m having trouble keeping up! There are so many! You’ve all made me laugh so I thank you!

I’m also taking y’all’s advice, I will be seeing if I can rescind my resignation, or at least be able to reapply as soon as possible. :)

b8b1ab,TIFU (NSFW) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.,30499,0.74,2387,2019-04-02 04:48:00,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b8b1ab/tifu_nsfw_by_forgetting_that_my_boyfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b8b1ab/tifu_nsfw_by_forgetting_that_my_boyfriend/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"Before everyone freaks out - yes, I am on birth control. Also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

This happened 30 minutes ago. I'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

My boyfriend and I both lead pretty busy lives. He works full time and often works overnight shifts. On the other hand, I'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.

After an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O'Brien's words, ""take grandma to Applebee's."" It's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,"" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

Anyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

Fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician's Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

For the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

Anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). Midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" Do you finally have a bf?"" (It's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, I wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). I awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That's the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

The poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,"" Did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" It's okay, I'll do it.""

Before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" Guess your dry spell is finally over!"" We speak casually like friends so I'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

Guys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

Also, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.

TL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

EDIT: For those of you suggesting that this is an April Fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. My dignity is in shambles but I’m glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

Also, yes, I did shower. My after-sex routine always involves a shower where I proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like I am a reborn Christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. Although a hefty amount DID come out last night, apparently, not all of it. Contrary to popular belief, cooter’s are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. Washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the INSIDE which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the Nutella jar, is where the semen goes. A pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

In my case, just like ~~Noah~~ Moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

EDIT 2: For those that don't believe this is true.. or that I am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/TwRHKGz

EDIT 3: For those that STILL don't believe me:

https://imgur.com/a/yMZJvJK

Also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. You may think it's unprofessional but I've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, I was single for 3 years and I'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. As part of a regular check up for STD screening, he always asked if I have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, I'd say no then tell him how much I longed for a relationship. If this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have NEVER acted like this. I have PCOS/am high risk for cervical cancer so I am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/Metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). He's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. It took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and I wouldn't change it for the world. Though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician ESPECIALLY a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that I view him as a friend. 

To clarify, bf and I had sex around 3am last night, I cleaned up, then we went to bed. Today (or I guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so I legitimately woke up and Netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

Believe me or not, that's up to you. All I'm saying is I swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and I am still super embarrassed. In the years that I've been his patient, I have never seen this young female PA before. I do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, I can only guess. I'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. The PA gave me my pap smear and I had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my PCOS anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, I'm sure we will redo the pap smear. My appointment was at 2pm but I was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. However, I'll be sure not to have PiV sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as I genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where I am in a relationship ever).

I honestly was NOT expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. I never even really post on Reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows I have this account *shrugs*. I guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

Some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. I decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. I also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as I could. Sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. I appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

It was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day. 

Goodnight Reddit!"

I've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback. Well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since I have ADHD, I have been checking the box marked ""Intellectual Disability"" all these months. 


So about fifteen minutes ago I'm going through an application like normal and I get to the part where they ask about disabilities. This is what it reads: ""Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I've been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.


TLDR: I've been checking the ""Intellectual Disability"" in applications to declare ADHD when that actual means mental retardation. I've fucked up over a hundred job applications."

While laying in bed watching Pewdiepie’s minecraft videos I got quite hungry and thought to myself “I can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?” Normally, yes. So I take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don’t know it’s a japanese convenience store.) I browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. Checking out goes fine since I don’t really need to communicate, just hand over money.

So I suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences I take a HUGE swig of diet coke, like so big that i can’t swallow all of it and it’s just sitting in my mouth. Than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. Than it hits me. I remember the experiments I did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. That was the very moment I knew I fucked up. So before I can think literally anything else it’s foaming out of my mouth and I choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. So obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. And of course I am sitting there, completely clueless. They were probably asking me if I needed help? I am dying of sheer embarrassment so I deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. Once I get back to my hotel room and start to settle in I remember that I left my actual food on the sidewalk. So I just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. 

TL;DR: I mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn’t speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued."
hlcbs1,TIFU by telling my daughter her hero Bob Ross was dead,30466,0.93,632,2020-07-05 04:20:14,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hlcbs1/tifu_by_telling_my_daughter_her_hero_bob_ross_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hlcbs1/tifu_by_telling_my_daughter_her_hero_bob_ross_was/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory ""this was two years ago"". My daughter was 4 at the time.

My daughter's love of Bob Ross started in the womb. I had terrible insomnia throughout my pregnancy, and I would listen to Bob Ross painting tutorials each night to fall asleep. (At the time I thought it helped me sleep because it was essentially soothing background noise, but recently I've learned about ASMR and I realize that I am super susceptible to certain sounds, such as quiet calm voices, and the scratching of paint brushes and tools). Anyways, after my daughter was born, I continued to have a hard time sleeping-- this time because of a crying and demanding baby. So every night, I'd lay down in my bed with her next to me in the bassinet, and I'd play Bob Ross. As my daughter got older, she began to demand Bob Ross. We'd read a board book or two before bed, and then we'd watch one half hour tutorial. By the end of these videos, my daughter (and often myself) would be sound asleep. For years this routine has continued. It continued through my second pregnancy, and now with my second daughter as well. We watch Bob Ross EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. We've seen each and every Joy of Painting tutorial (all 403 episodes) multiple times.

Some nights I might think my kids have fallen asleep during book time (we are past board books and onto chapter books now). But when I close the book and prepare to sneak out of their room inevitably one or both of them chirps up: ""Mama, what about Bob Ross?"" And so we watch Bob Ross.

Which brings me to the fateful day. After watching a particularly compelling episode of the Joy of Painting, my four year old sighed happily and said ""Mama, one day I'd like to go visit Bob Ross. Where does he live again?"" To which I replied ""Muncie, Indiana remember?"" ""Oh yes"" she said, recalling that Bob mentions Muncie frequently. And then....and to this day I still don't entirely know why...I said these words: ""But honey, I have to tell you something. Bob Ross died a long time ago. We might be able to visit Muncie, but won't be able to meet Bob"".

And my daughter broke down completely.

Now, like most parents, I've seen my kids cry. I've seen ALL their cries: when they are angry, hungry, scared, bored, whining, manipulating, you name it. But I had never heard her cry like this. She was completely and utterly bereft. She was wailing and punching herself in the chest and thighs while giant strangled sobs burst from her lungs. The news that her hero was dead just destroyed her.

She cried for a solid 20 minutes. My husband (helpfully) shouted up from the main floor of the house ""What the hell made you think that would be a good idea? Seriously, what possessed you to tell her that?"" And I couldn't really answer except that I had felt in that moment that I shouldn't lie to her. That I should tell her the truth about Bob Ross and that he wasn't alive anymore.

After she stopped crying we talked a lot about Bob Ross, how he died, and about his legacy. I told her about how Bob Ross gave a very important gift to the world, and that his own love of painting had inspired so many artists and people in every country. Even as a four year old with limited understanding of life and death, she seemed to find some solace in that. 1.5 years later she still brings up how Bob Ross made a lot of people happy, and how he makes her happy still.

So that's my TIFU. My lovely 5.5 and 3 year old daughters will surely be demanding ""Bob Ross"" tonight, and as always I will oblige them.

TL;DR: My young daughter loves Bob Ross. I told her that he was dead.

EDIT:

Oh my goodness, this blew up.  I checked in right before I put my kids to bed and my eldest and I sat up and read some of the comments together. She particularly loved the Bob Ross Lego figurine someone shared (she is a big Lego fan) and thought one user's story about their Mom becoming a professional painter after watching Bob Ross tutorials was ""really nice"".

I also read the post itself to my daughter, and she smiled and chuckled along. When it got to the part where her Dad questioned my general parenting abilities she stopped to ask me ""why would Dad say that to you?"" and when I replied ""well, he thought I should've protected your feelings"" she said rather matter-of-factly ""You shouldn't lie to children"". So I guess she agrees with my approach(?)

Several people asked where you can find all the Bob Ross episodes, and the answer is Youtube! Check out the [Bob Ross channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ).  Tonight my girls and I watched this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoJ2tcXWb7g)).

And finally to answer the question of  ""did I know that it was the 25th anniversary of Bob Ross' death today?"" No, I did not. That's honestly blowing my mind a little bit, because I've been thinking about making this TIFU post for a few weeks, and it just so happens I finally sat down today and wrote it up.  I couldn't remember the exact year he died until I looked it up on his Wiki entry today, and I totally glossed over the specific date. July 4th. What a weird weird coincidence.

Second update: Holy smokes. Almost 26,000 upvotes? I’m so pleased my FU resonated with so many. Thanks to the folks who gave me flair and gold; I’ve never made a post on Reddit that attracted much attention, haha. 

I seriously enjoyed all the funny, heartbreaking and relatable stories of the first time you experienced your own loss of a hero— Elvis, Michael Jackson, members of the Beatles, MLK, Mr. Rogers....thank you for your comments and I’ll continue to read them all.

And finally thanks to everyone who shared their own stories of Bob Ross and the influence he had on their lives. It’s awesome that he continues to inspire so many people with his art tutorials, love of animals and nature, life advice and kindness 25 years after his death. The world is truly a better place because of him.

I guess the FU was actually over two years ago. I had just quit my job on a whim and decided to move to NYC. Money was tight and I was living with my parents until I could find work and a place to live. 

I was chilling on the couch eating popcorn when I bit down on something hard. The pain was excruciating and what I though might be a popcorn kernel ended up being a large chunk of my second molar. 

With no health Insurance of any kind, I was terrified of what the bill was going to be. but the pain was so bad I sucked it up and went to my dentist. The dentist drilled away and put a temp cap on what used to be a tooth. Before I left he told me "" that was a deep cavity, if it still hurts in a week you will need a root canal"". 

The pain from breaking the tooth was so bad it was a relief to have the cap on. But I noticed quickly that I could not drink anything cold on the side of my mouth. I figured this was just due to how deep the filling went. I started tilting my head to drink cold water.  Then my GF started telling me I was eating in my sleep. After a few weeks she became concerned. ""You are slamming your teeth together and grinding the shit out of them at night"" she said. I bought a mouth guard. A few months In and I started to wake up with headaches. Looking back, these all should have been signs of how much pain I was in. 

1 yr later: I have great health insurance but I'm not really In noticable pain. It's annoying that I can't drink cold water on that side and that I wake up with headaches every morning but... W.e I deal with it. I can tell one side of my mouth feel different but again I write it off and just chew on the other side when needed. 

Fast forward to the global pandemic: I start waking up with shooting pain so unbearable that I can't get back to sleep for hours. After a few weeks of little to no sleep FINALLY it's time to go to the dentist. My dentist is a pro, he looks me over taps on my teeth with some metal thing and says "" time for that root canal bud"".

 It happened fast, my primary dentist sends me over to the oral surgeon right from his office. But, the oral surgeon can't figure out what is going on. He has some sort of liquid nitrogen tool that he is spraying onto my teeth and telling me to raise my hand when it hurts. But I'm not raising my hand. He's getting pretty upset and saying ""OP, this is no time to be brave. this much cold should be excruciating even on a healthy tooth"". It's feels strange i tell him. Annoyed and confused the Dr leaves to go call my primary. When he comes back he says: I trust primary, if he says you need a root canal then that's what we will do. 

The whole process was super easy, don't let anyone tell you root canals hurt. It was honestly easier than getting a cavity filled.  It was done in 40 min and I felt NOTHING. The surgeon told me to expect pain for a few days also some jaw soreness. But, the weird thing is: I felt AMAZING. I hadn't even realized how much pain I was in over the past two years. Compared to that pain, the soreness from the procedure felt great. Right after the novacane wore off I felt incredibly strange and clear headed for the first time I could remember. I was less irritable and I wasn't clenching my jaw like I usually do. 

Looking back, I couldn't feel the cold test because my nerves were already maxed out on pain and had been for a long time. Waking up the morning after, I feel like a whole new person. I can't believe I was able to ignore that level of pain for that long but it feels like a drug not to have it. I haven't taken any pain meds for my tooth because it feels so great just to have a tiny bit of soreness around the tooth now. I spent 10 min this morning just swishing ice cold water back and forth in my mouth in amazement. 


Tldr; I convinced myself a large amount of dental pain was normal as it got worse and worse over two years. When I finally did something about it l, it got better instantly.


Edit: I went to an endodontist. Some have pointed out that oral surgeon is a specific study and not a broader term like I thought it was."

I had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

Flash forward to yesterday, when I was looking through my old junk. I was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when I came upon the box. I smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. I put it aside for today, when I decided to use it. Out of lube, I went it dry, fuck up #1. Once I reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, I felt a tickling sensation. Uneased I pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. To my surprise, and disgust, I was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. Without thinking, I instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. In pain, I freaked out and let the spider get away.

My dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

tl;dr - stuck my dick in a unused fleshlight just to find a spider on my tip, hurting myself in the process of getting it off


Edit: threw out the toy, couldn’t get the image out of my head...

My stomach was having a particularly raunchy morning after consuming both dairy and gluten in the same meal and my body had made the decision to cancel all plans for the next hour as I’d be glued to the toilet for fear of shitting my brains out. As I finished up feeling much better off than I was when I sat down, I decided it was time to wash up and set the bidet to low but as I did this the pressure started dropping and I can’t get a good clean in with no pressure. So, I gradually turned it up till it began to return to normal, which just so happened to be at max. Sat there for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and almost as soon as I’d turned it to max, the pressure returned screaming for vengeance and plowed a hole through my anus and power washed my colon leaving me too stunned to scream and scrambled to shut the damn thing off. All the while I was barely able to keep my ass down so the water wouldn’t spray all over the bathroom. I sat there for maybe 30 seconds collecting myself when I felt a deep sloshing and rushing feeling like a trapped fart finally making its escape. I prepared for this thing to rip me half as it exited but I had my expectations blown out of the water, literally. This wanna be fart ended up being a stream of water that turned on my butthole on like a bath faucet and proceeded to shit straight water for about 40 seconds while I could only sit there helpless and wait for the endless stream of water rushing out of my crev to stop. Once I was all finished up I skipped the toilet paper and went right to a bathroom towel as everything in the bowl at this point was dripping wet from the raw power of uncontrolled water pressure. Anyways two hours later now and I still am not able to trust farts and my turds are about as solid as a not completely dried paper machet.

TL;DR Cranked the bidet up to 11 when the pressure started dropping and gave myself a enema when it returned

EDIT: Can’t thank everyone for all the awards, so this is my thanks

EDIT 2: Seen a lot of “what’s the bidet” or something like that and it’s a HelloTushy, great bidet though"
kxs669,TIFU by accidentally up-skirting my colleague,30421,0.9,1261,2021-01-15 16:15:46,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kxs669/tifu_by_accidentally_upskirting_my_colleague/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kxs669/tifu_by_accidentally_upskirting_my_colleague/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I work in an office that's recently had a new printer installed. It's one of those big MFD things that scans, photocopies and prints on A4, A3 and all sorts of types of paper.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to like the cheap copier paper the company buys. If you print any more than about 5-6 pages at once, it jams up and tells you ""Call Service Agent"".

If you turn it off at the wall, remove all the jammed paper, then turn it back on again, it will usually just check itself and then continue to work normally. Not today though. There must be a bit of paper stuck in a place that we can't see or get to, as it just keeps asking for us to call a service agent.

This is where I fucked up. My colleague is wearing a fairly short skirt - about halfway down to the knee - with patterned tights. She's looking around while we decide that it definitely needs an engineer to visit. I spy a sticker about halfway down on the unit with all the details we need - the number to call, the 16 digit Reference number and the 16 digit serial number, as well as the machine type etc.  

Rather than scrawl all that down onto a post-it, I decide to whip out my phone and take a picture of the sticker. Just as I do, my colleague - who has her back to me - leans down to get into the bottom-most paper tray, my phone gets caught under her skirt as I press the shutter button.   

I say ""whoa!"" as she turns her head to see me with my hand up her skirt, and the flash from my camera goes off. My protest of ""oh my God, no!"" sounds more like I'm upset she caught me than trying to explain it's a genuine mistake.

""What the heck?"" she asked, with good reason. As I'm trying to explain, our boss comes out of his office, which the printer is situated just outside of, and tries to work out what's happening.

I figure the best thing to do is to take the picture I was trying to, then show them both that the flash picture was just blurry and delete it in front of them. They say they both understand what was happening, but I'm still mortified.

This happened about half an hour ago, and so far I've had 4 different news articles forwarded to me regarding people who have been convicted of up-skirting, one regarding the actual legislation, and one to a link for a selfie stick with the suggestion I wouldn't need to actually put my hand up anyone's skirt to get a picture if I bought that.

TL; DR: don't try and take pictures of stuff without warning colleagues in the vicinity first."

I built my first ever PC around 3.5 years ago. It's pretty budget but I thought for the £500 I was spending on parts, it would be pretty decent. So I follow a couple of youtube tutorials to build it and everything worked fine first try, to my absolute surprise. Over the course of the 3 years, I've never had one problem with it other than it was pretty slow and could only run games on low or medium at best, depending on the age of the game. It would take quite a long time to boot, and usually I'd have to let it 'warm up' for a minute or so til I could open browsers or do stuff without apps crashing. Was not ideal to say the least.

Cut to 2 weeks ago, a friend was telling me about the new RAM he just got, which got me thinking about my lil ol' PC and how it's 3 years old, and how it could maybe use a few cheap upgrades. The first thing I look at when I open up my PC is the 8GB stick of RAM (some of you may see where this is going) cause I only have 2 RAM slots, and he looked so lonely, so thought I'd look into a 2nd stick to keep him company. After a bit of RAM research, I started seeing the words 'dual-channel' a lot, so delved a bit deeper. I read more and more about how people in similar situations to mine should have originally went with 2x4GB instead of 1x8GB if your motherboard supports dual-channel cause it's magic (I'm reciting stuff I have no idea about, I could be wrong here) and that you should try and use the same manufacturer/frequency if you're going to get multiple sticks. 

I found the same model of RAM on eBay for less than £30 a week or so ago, so I ordered it. It arrived today. I plugged it in and immediately thought I'd try and load up something that used to crash my PC hard: a large map on Rust. The large map, which previously suplexed my pc, loaded in faster than a small map used to with 1 stick of RAM, and was running at a solid 60fps while running around chopping stuff. No crashes, no screen tearing, just a working game. So, I redownloaded WoW which I haven't played for a year or so, but I could only run it on medium graphics with sunshafts/shadows off if I wanted anywhere close to 60fps). I logged on and fiddled around with the settings and turns out my PC is capable of running the game on high, with sunshafts/shadows on high, at an unmoving 60fps. All it took was another stick of RAM to make my PC not a piece of shit. I'm in disbelief at how my PC is now like twice as good, and at how it now feels like I've been using half a PC for 3 years. I'm such an idiot.

TL;DR Seemingly badly bottlenecked my PC by only using 1 stick of RAM instead of 2. It went from really shit to really not shit 3.5 years too late. I am idiot."

My sophomore year of high school I was dating a girl I met on the swim team. She and I seemed to hit it off pretty quick and all was good. I was over at her place one day and we were watching a movie together. Her grandfather that she lived with at the time came in to let us know he was running to the store and would be back in about 45 minutes. Around that same time, her sister let us know she was leaving to go hang out with her boyfriend, leaving the two of us utterly alone. We’re sitting there just watching the movie when she says she’s a little warm and takes her shirt off, so she’s just there in her sweatpants and bra. I’m a virgin at this rate so I’m trying to pretend that that didn’t give me the world’s fastest boner and act like it’s totally nothing. She then decides her sweatpants are a little warm and takes those off too, all the while, I’m pretending to not notice. 

Now I’ll be honest here, I legit had no clue what was going on. I was raised to be very very respectful and never assume women are hinting at something, because after all, it was a little warm in there. We’re cuddled up on this sofa, her half naked, when she gets up, walks over to her drawer, and whips out a condom. She walks over to me and goes “Soooo, I have a condom.” to which I reply “Oh, cool. Why?” And she says “Well, you never know when you’re going to need one.” then I say “Oh fair point. Well keep an eye on it! Those things expire, you know!” She paused for a few moments, then said “I don’t think I’ll have it long enough to expire.” and I go “That’s the spirit!”. She just stares at me, dumbfounded, and I stare back, still painfully unaware of what’s going on. She puts it back, throws her clothes back on and we finish the movie. She broke up with me about a week later….

TL;DR: half naked girlfriend told me about her condom and I told her to keep an eye on it in case it expires.

EDIT: Some people are saying this is fake because no one can possibly be this oblivious, and honestly, I can’t blame you. That being said, this really is a 100% true story. What you all have to understand is that I was homeschooled until high school and lived in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors, and therefore, I had next to no social interaction. I quite literally had no idea how to interact with people, lol."

I had dropped some acid with my friends a few hours earlier and I was just leaving their place to go down the road to my house. I was still in the peak and my mind was all over the place.

As I was walking, a rough looking dog without a collar came up to me and looked at me with such pitiful eyes. I felt a connection with the creature. I thought about it’s life and what it must have gone through to get to this point. Without thinking, I reached into my wallet and pulled out a twenty and just handed it to the dog and it took it in its mouth and ran off with it. I felt so satisfied and warm. About an hour later, I realized what I had done. 

I like to think the dog wandered into some shop and gave the twenty to someone who then gave him food, but I know the odds of that are pretty slim. At least I tried to do something nice I guess.

TLDR: did drugs and tried to do something nice, gave a dog money."

Y’all, it’s been a long ass holiday weekend. 
From cooking, to cleaning, to the kids being out of school since Wednesday. I’ve had little to no “me time”. So tonight, once the kids were tucked in bed, I decided to treat myself to a nice soak in the tub. 
Let me tell y’all, that bitch felt amazing. I scrubbed and soaked and enjoyed. Then, I got up to shower to wash the weekend away. Am I the only weirdo who has to shower after a bath? 
As I grabbed the handheld shower to wash my nether regions, things were feeling pretty damn good. So I decided to linger there for awhile. I mean, hopefully no kids will try to barge in this late,and the hubs is watching YouTube videos on bowling, so he isn’t exactly turning me on big time at the moment. Perfect timing.
I was playing with the different massage jets and found the perfect pressure. 
It was about this time, I assume, my husband got up from his videos to start that load of laundry I’ve been asking him to do since noon.
How do I know this?
Because just as the pressure got oh so perfect, and my knees began to wobble, the lovely warm water on my lady bits turned to MOLTEN HOT LAVA. I was already hitting that big O so I couldn’t just jump out, I was too shaky. So my dumb ass just releases the lava hose, causing it to spray all over my shuddering legs. My right legs slips, I go down on one knee, and finally reach past the spray to turn off the faucet. 
So now I’m in bed, legs splayed, with my fan soothing my meat locker.

TL;DR : Used shower head to get off, got burned

Edit: Y’all. Gold, platinum? Front page? Wow, I’m humbled. Thanks.

Edit 2: Husband has found front page. He is an amazing man and bowling is the coolest.

Edit 3: More medals! Thank you! My inbox is a pretty full place but I’m doing my best to reply to all the nice ones. To those saying I’m good with words, thank you, that really means a lot to me. To those saying I made this up, I assure you I didn’t, but I can’t prove it so believe what you will. Lastly, no, I won’t be sending anyone photographic evidence of the aforementioned meat locker."
cgtkb4,TIFU by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend,30314,0.9,828,2019-07-23 20:20:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cgtkb4/tifu_by_sending_a_picture_of_the_engagement_ring/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cgtkb4/tifu_by_sending_a_picture_of_the_engagement_ring/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"tl;dr: Accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24F). I was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  So I put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. Welp, it was immediately after clicking send that I noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. I looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: It was my gf. ""Shit"" I said over the phone. My friend asked what was wrong, and I told him I'd have to call him back. Tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  As a last ditch effort, I called her, as the message did not yet say ""Delivered"". She answered the phone and I immediately said ""Do you see the message I just sent?"" ""Yeah...it says attachment, why?"" Immediately I blurted ""Dont open it! Just delete the thread. Please."" 

&nbsp;

  She sounded concerned, and asked ""Is this something I should be worried about? You're kinda scaring me lol"". ""No, no,"" I said, ""I just have a little surprise for you I was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" She relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""Ok, I deleted it. Didn't look at it."" I know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but I can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. The 1 or 2 times I ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. It's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  So I had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now I had her HIGHLY suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. So I immediately went and found a cute little necklace on Etsy I knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. Later that week she got it and texted me, saying I was very sweet and she loved my surprise. Phew. A few weeks later I actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected I was going to propose. Despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  When I told her about what that text really was and how I covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. She was impressed with how I improvised and threw her off track lol. We're getting married next October :)

I also had dandruff issues since I could remember. Having an itchy scalp and the occasional teasing from kids was a mild annoyance, so I never sought a remedy.

As an adult, I started using selenium sulfide shampoos that immediately cured my dandruff. It became my daily shampoo for the next 15 years. Somewhere along the line, I also started showering earlier so my hair would dry to avoid bed head. One day my barber mentioned my hair smelled like sulfur as if I was using too much dandruff shampoo. She said I dont need daily treatments with that stuff. So I stopped to see how long it takes for the dandruff to come back so I could make a schedule. It never did.

One random day some years later I suddenly had dandruff. It was at this moment that I finally thought about why I had dandruff. Why now after all these years? I always assumed it was genetic. What changed recently? Was it something I'm doing and not genetic? Then it occured to me. I had a pair of long nights a couple days ago. I showered , but was too tired to dry my hair and fell asleep. I finally googled ""wet hair and dandruff"" and gained closure for my childhood affliction.

If anyone else out there has a dandruff problem, wet hair cultivates existing microbes in your scalp that causes dandruff. I was propagating them on my pillow every night for 15 years.

TL;DR I slept with wet hair regularly as a kid resulting in moderate dandruff until I was an adult.

*Edit. Glad my post helped all you other flaky headed goobers. Be advised there's other reasons why dandruff occurs so your mileage may vary. Thanks for the awards and rip inbox."

Also TLDR at the end.

Context : I am from India. I never exactly received a sex talk from my parents 

When I was 14, I had noticed there was a small lump of skin in my scrotum just above my nuts. I was so dumb, that I thought that was the formation of a new testicle. I had had recently seen a news clippings with a woman who had 3 breasts. So I thought it would be applicable for guys as well. So the dumb me decided that I should wait it off and see the ""third testicle"" grow. I also thought that this would be a sign of virility. 

Fast forward 1.5 years, the lump became bigger and oddly shaped and it would pain a lot sometimes. At that time I had recently read about cancer in school. Now I had convinced myself that the lump was actually a tumor. That started freaking me out a lot. I used masturbate a lot, so I believed that that was the reason this was caused. Since I never talked to my parents about my masturbation habits, I was too shy to talk to my parents about it. The tumor would retract back into my abdomen some times. One time when I actually mustered the courage to talk to my parents about it, it had retracted back. They assumed that the pain was being caused because of my testicles descending. So I also ignored it and prayed that the tumor would just go away. 

Few years went by and I tried to ignore my tumor as much as possible. Once I read an article about cysts, and I believed that that swelling could also be a cyst. Whenever I'd read about a new swelling or tumor, I'd just believe that that's what I had.

When I started college and moved to a dorm, I would try everything possible for people to not see me naked. The tumor had become ugly, but it was was of a constant size now. I just assumed that my body was abnormal and I couldn't do anything about it. 

Fast forward to this year (currently 21), I had to come back to my home because of COVID. One day I was changing my clothes after taking a shower. My brother accidentally walked into me changing my clothes. He saw my crotch and was ridiculously surprised at what that monstrosity was. That was the first time I confessed about my crotch issues to anyone. After having this tumor for so long, I was more ashamed that being an adult, I wasn't able to come clean about a medical issue I was facing. My brother nudged me for a few days and forced me to talk to my parents about this issue. I finally caved in and talked to my father about this. He took me to the doctor the next day. I was nervous that the doctor would be shocked and I would be diagnosed with stage four cancer or something. Turns out it was just a hernia. Apparently as the doctor has speculated, this hernia was caused because my muscles were weak and the gap created when the testes descend didn't seal properly causing the hernia. I got my surgery scheduled within a few days. I got a laparoscopy to treat my hernia. It's been 1.5 months since my surgery. I've made great recovery since. 

I've wasted over 6-7 years of my life overthinking and living with discomfort because of my hernia. 

TLDR: I didn't get my hernia checked up on time and ended up having body image issues for almost 5 years."

The iconic and viral clip of a mother storming in on her children and asking which one of them didn't flush after using the toilet has been a corner stone of me and my boyfriend's relationship.

Today, my boyfriend took the largest poop I have ever seen. And I mean largest. It wasn't even broken into pieces. One long continuous poop. And while he might have tried to flush it, it did not work and ended up greeting me in the face when I too, needed to take an incredibly large poop. Out of pure humour, I barged straight into my boyfriends WFH office and in my best and loudest Scottish accent said ""DID YA TAKE A SHIT AND NOT FLUSH? DISGUUUSTAN!!"".

The intention was to laugh with my boyfriend and for him to come and see how it didn't flush correctly. Instead, his face went completely white and jaw dropped. He was on a video call with not only his boss, but his entire team. We normally have a little sign to put on the door when we are in video calls, but just like how he maybe forgot to flush, he forgot to let me know he was having a company wide meeting where he was presenting.

**TLDR: Today life imitated art and I interrupted my boyfriends company wide meeting by accusing him of taking a poop without flushing.**

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Everything is somewhat fine between us. We often times like to prank and scare one another, so it comes with the territory. Luckily most of his (younger) colleagues know the video reference and thought I was doing it intentionally as a joke. However now he is a little panicked that this will make it to the front page and some people he works with will realise it most definitely wasn't a joke and he most definitely made the worlds largest poop. 

Edit: well, you guys did it. TIFU’ed by thinking this wouldn’t make it to the front page, or at very least there would be another gay European couple male who had his company wide meeting interrupted by his boyfriend quoting a viral video about his large shit. One of his colleagues wrote him that they saw this post. I wanted to delete it but for whatever reason he thinks that’s even worse. We have decided the best course of action is to share this post with the wider company and doxx/expose me as a drag race and real housewives/below deck super fan which is equally as embarrassing. I guess i deserve this karma! Thank you all for giving us a massive laugh this lockdown and adding another (cute) shitty layer to our relationship ❤️"

Husband and I have been together 15 years.  We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

He asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

I walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He's not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought ""I'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

He's loving it.  I'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

I feel something as I'm making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.  

TL;DR - Exfoliated husband's balls with my mouth."

This happened in the Spring of 2015.

 My girlfriend at the time, a hardcore Disney fanatic we'll call Becky, had commissioned a custom Elsa cosplay from the movie Frozen.   A friend of hers (Ryan) who Becky had lost contact with for several years, had come back into her life about that time.  While we were hanging out, Ryan mentioned his youngest daughter was having her 5th birthday party the next day. Like any child alive and under the age of 14 at the time, her favorite movie was Frozen.  I mentioned Becky's Elsa cosplay to Ryan, and suggested she show up to the birthday party in character to surprise his daughter.  Both of them loved this idea.

The birthday party wasn't being held at Ryan's home.  It was being held at a community center in the suburb they lived in.  It was a large, spacious, 2 story building. It had a central atrium where the main stair were, and all but 2 of the rooms had large windows looking into the heart of the building.  

As Becky and I arrived at the community on the April day, the early morning sunshine gave way to gray clouds, and gentle slow flurries started to fall. This is not uncommon in Minnesota in early April, but the timing made me smile.
Then it happened...

As we entered the community center, the rooms all around us were filled with families and children having birthday parties and other events. All the rooms but one were occupied that day.  As the living personification of Elsa strolled the doorway into the central atrium...the parties stopped.

Grade school aged children fixed their gaze on the shimmering blue dress and translucent cape, the long blonde wig, the pale white skin, like lionesses stalking gazelles. The talking and yelling got quiet as the collectively drew in their breaths in a gasp...

And then screaming began:

""Mom, its Elsa!""
""Dad can I go meet Elsa!?!?!""
""CAN WE PLEASE HAVE ELSA AT OUR PARTY???? PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE?!?!?""

 For a moment I felt like one of the coolest kids in school.  After all I was escorting ""Elsa"" to her engagement. I was lucky enough to be dating this bad ass cosplayer. She was authentic enough for the kids to believe it was was the actual character.

 And then I saw the expressions on the adults faces...

Several adults were next to their children, pointing and enjoying their children's moment of wonder as a ""Disney Princess"" walked by them in real life.   But when I locked eyes with what the parents of the child whose birthday was being celebrated, the expression was undeniable.

Scorn.
Sheer Scorn.

 Because from the moment my girlfriend walked into that building, no matter how awesome the birthday party was: Their child's birthday party did NOT have Elsa at it.  And now they were going to have to deal with that fact.

The room Ryan's daughter was celebrating her birthday in was possibly a large storage closet at one point in time. But the 10 children and small group of parents fit inside of it nicely. There was also the added benefit that it had no windows facing into or out of the building, so the children didn't see Becky stroll up to the door before she made her entrance.

 Once Becky was in the room the magic of a little girl's imagination was overpowering. Before Becky even sat down next to the 5 year old, she was crying happy tears and looked like she might pass out from excitement. The other children at the birthday party were equally spellbound, save for one 7 year old boy who was NOT going be fooled and insisted Becky wasn't the REAL Elsa.

 With the patience of a saint, Becky sat with the birthday girl enjoying cake, watching her open presents, answering endless questions about Arendelle, Reindeer, Trolls, Princess Anna... all the while the 7 year old denied her authenticity. Every time the boy try to catch Becky up in a logic trap, Becky was quick enough to answer with a completely plausible reason for why she did not have reindeer with her, and why she wouldn't perform magic in Minnesota ( The governor had asked her not to after all...)

 After 45 minutes of being overloaded on cuteness, cake, and small children screaming, I stepped outside the room to catch a breath child free air for a few minutes. I noticed through the second story windows that the snowfall had gotten much thicker and heavier. Quarter sized snowflakes were floating slowly,  cinematically through the air and covering everything in sight. It was incredibly beautiful, so much so that I didn't notice the 5 adults staring at me from 10 feet away.

 One of them cautiously approached me and said, ""You came with that girl in the princess costume right?"" I told them I had, at which point he asked me if Becky would stop by his granddaughter's birthday party. And with that the floodgates opened as all the other people began asking for Becky to stop into their parties too. 
""Real guickly, just for a few minutes...""
""Just for a quick photo!""""
I'll pay if you do, $50...""
""I'll pay $100 but she has to sing the song!"" 
""It would mean so much to him.""""Please she won't stop crying about it. It's her fault for doing this to her after all.""

And then I quickly realized I was in hostile territory...

I calmly told them I would ask if it was possible, knowing it wasn't, and slipped back into the room.   Becky was just finishing up her rendition of ""Let It Go""  And all the children but one were singing along with her.  Becky sat down with the birthday girl, as the 7 year old doubter continued his attacks on her identity.  The birthday girl, (bless her) turned to this 7 year old little cynic and said, ""She's answered all your questions right, she's Elsa!  Now leave her alone!""

 I never wanted to high five a kid so hard in my entire life.

As the birthday party was winding down about then, I whispered to Becky that some of the other parents were jealous and wanted her presence at their parties. She flatly turned that notion down. When I mention the snowfall getting heavy, Becky's eyes lit up a bit.

Becky turned to the birthday girl and said, ""Guess what? I'm not supposed to do this. But it's your birthday so if you keep a secret for me, maybe I can get away with some magic...""  
 The birthday girl carefully nodded her head, unblinking as if she was afraid she might miss whatever would come next. Becky closed her eyes and went into a expression of serene concentration for about 30 seconds. When she opened her eyes she stood up and led the birthday girl outside of the room to the 2nd floor windows.
 
Where there had been a cold but sunny Minnesota spring day an hour before there was now a wintery twilight blanketed in thick white snow, still coming down. All the children followed into the hallway, and stared in absolute wonder. At this point even the 7 year old doubting child had his jaw a near the floor.

 Becky got the biggest hug from the birthday girl as she said goodbye, and the children were herded back into the celebration room to collect their toys, candy, and presents.   I caught a few adults from the other parties waiting on the 2nd floor, expectantly looking towards us. I slowly shook my head ""No"" in their direction at which point I received a few death glares.

 We decided to exit out the opposite side of the building than we had entered, for safety reasons. As we were 30 feet from the door, a group of a dozen children and their parents made their way in the community center. As one of the mothers was commenting, ""I didn't think it was supposed to snow today...""  Becky and I walked past the group quickly. The audible gasps from the children were hysterical. One child even pointed and yelled ""That's why its snowing, Elsa did it!""

 The look of cognitive dissonance on the parents face was priceless...but I knew another  parent would have to explain why they hadn't gotten Elsa to attend their child birthday.

TLDR: My girlfriend dressed up as Elsa for a birthday party in the Spring of 2015. The parents of other children having birthday parties in the same building got angry/jealous because their party didn't have Elsa attending. An incredibly convenient spring snowstorm convinced a bunch of grade school children that my girlfriend was absolutely the real Elsa.."

Him: *turning to me angrily* ""IT'S NOT FUNNY!!""

Me: ""I'm sorry sweetie, I won't do it again""

Him: *resuming his prayer* ""And please don't let my toys come alive tonight. Amen""

And he hopped into bed. 

My stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so I just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like I was praying deeply as I tried to compose my self. 

Then I got up quickly trying to hide my face, and I sneaked one last look to say good night as I shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. 



Edit: Thank you so much for the likes, comments,  gold and silver!  I really didn't think it was going to make it to the front page ! 

I actually thought it was going to get removed or downvoted because of our religion! I didn't realize so  many people have such hate towards people who believe in a higher power! 😥 It convinces me to keep teaching my son to love and to show respect to everyone no matter what they believe in. 

 I had a lot of fun reading everyone's comments.  They were very funny.  I am very Thankful!😊😊

This is the cute little guy with his mama!

TL;DR. My son prayed asking Jesus to not have his toys come alive,  I tried to hide my laugh and he gave me the death glare.

kvecp1,TIFU by giving one of my twins laxtives.,30145,0.86,1662,2021-01-12 04:24:45,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kvecp1/tifu_by_giving_one_of_my_twins_laxtives/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kvecp1/tifu_by_giving_one_of_my_twins_laxtives/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"This happened yesterday. My twins are 3 year old fraternal girls that recently graduated to using the downstairs powder room to go potty instead of the dump cups. Twin A has no issue with number 1 or number 2 but Twin B is a different story. Twin B is a clencher. She holds her poop. I have a total of 4 kids and she is the only one to ever do this. Her pediatrician reccomended Pedia-lax (stool softener for kids) make the job easier when the time came. So 2 days of OTC Pedia-lax and still no poop. 

Then comes day 3. Everything is normal and on schedule. Nothing out of the ordinary. Potty time comes and Twin A is in and out in about 5 minutes. Twin B's turn. She seemed tense. Like more tense than usual. She holds the potty seat on the toilet and locks her knees together. She's clenching. So to help the process, I hold her legs up so she has no way of clenching. She's getting upset and angry. I try to tell her to just let it go. 

Then I smell it. I pick her up and there it is. The largest poo I have ever seen in my entire life. I was shook. I clean Twin B up and get her settled in the playroom. Then make my way back to the impossibly gargantuan poo my little princess dropped off. I didn't know what to do. If I flushed it the toilet would definitely clog. I took a picture of it and sent it to my husband asking what I should do. He's an OTR truck driver and usually misses out on adventures like this. He calls me immediately laughing, joking that the poo looks like it's the size of Twin B's arm. He's not wrong. Then he tells me to break it up with the plunger. Well, that's not gonna work because not only is it long and poking out of the toilet water like a choco crocodile but it also has some girth to it. I'm freaking out at this moment because I know what I have to do. I grab an old steak knife that no one loves and attempt to cut the poo log into smaller ""poolettes"". 

It's like clay. The smell is horrid. I start dry heaving. My 2 sons and husband are all laughing hysterically. This is hell. I'm in hell. I get it down to about 4 slices and toss the newly dubbed ""poop knife"" in the trash. Then, with plunger in hand, I flush. It went down no problem and now I am 100% invested in helping Twin B have a regular poo schedule.

I am traumatized.
Never again.

TL;DR:

To avoid clogging a toilet I chopped a record breaking log of poo (courtesy of my 3 yr old daughter) in to 4 pieces with a steak knife. Which I quickly found out was my worse nightmare.

bbbzpt,TIFU by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina,30138,0.75,2824,2019-04-10 00:41:54,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bbbzpt/tifu_by_putting_a_5_hour_energy_in_my_vagina/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bbbzpt/tifu_by_putting_a_5_hour_energy_in_my_vagina/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,,False,"12 hours before my first “grown up job” interview, I was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company’s grounds. Considering I smoke weed daily I started looking up ways to pass a drug test. I came to the conclusion that I was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. I had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they’re just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

Unfortunately I was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time I had to prepare, but knowing that I wouldn’t be able to pass if the temperature wasn’t correct I had the idea to stick it up my vagina. I tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so I could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

Fast forward to the interview.
It was an hour and a half away so I decided to wait till I got there to insert it. I did it in my car w some coconut oil before I walked in just Incase they decided to drug test me first. I walked in and everything was fine, I signed in and they told me to take a seat. As soon as I sat down I knew something was wrong. I went to the bathroom to make sure I could still take it out. I began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn’t move. I tugged again and the string broke. At this point I’m freaking out. I try getting it out with my fingers but I can’t reach it. The only “tools” I have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. So in a 3 piece suit and heels, I squat and begin to use these “tools” to try and remove the bottle. About 4 min go by and I’m really freaking out but need to go back Incase they called my name. I walk out and the HR rep sees me and asks if I’m okay. I tell her I have a tampon stuck up my vagina that I can’t get out and that’s why I’m freaking out. She then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! Not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, I ask her if I can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. Obviously that didn’t work. So she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... Still didn’t work. At this point I just have to do the interview. It lasted 3 hours and I had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

When the interview finally ends I rush to the closest urgent care where I have to explain to the doctors why there’s a 5 hour energy in my vagina. At this point I’m convinced I just don’t have the right tools and they’ll get it out in no time. Upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it’s also sideways. Her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle IN MY VAGINA and then fish it out. ~Luckily~ they just sent me to the ER instead. 

So now I’m at the ER where they then inform me that since it’s behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since I wasn’t actually giving birth my body wasn’t dilated and they couldn’t remove the bottle without putting me under.  

Well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
I didn’t get the job and I didn’t even get drug tested. 

TLDR: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. After 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the ER it was finally removed

Edit: this isn’t made up. Idk if I have all the “anatomy” right I guess? Yes it was very painful. Yes, I have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don’t believe me

I’m just telling you guys what the doctors told me. They might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

Today I was browsing tinder and came across one of those ""I don't use this, add me on SC"" accounts, was feeling bored and horny and decided to add them. After they accepted my FR on Snapchat, I sent her a ""so how much, and what am I getting?"" message. She tells me its $40 for some videos and her venmo and I decide, fuck it, I'd like to see some of that.

After sending her the money, she proceeds to send me the videos, (pretty nice btw) and she asks what I think of them. I tell her she looks very sexy and she then sends me a message ""I'm kinda new to this. Tips are really appreciated.""

So I took this as ""Oh, she's new to selling her body on the internet, I should be constructive and try to help a new entrepreneur.""

I then proceed to spend the next 10 minutes going over her good points, things I think she could improve, specifically things like, ""You have really nice boobs, but I think you're overemphasizing them. You should try different positions, etc.""

After sending all of these messages, she responds, ""Oh. I meant tips as in like donations, but thanks anyways!""

Cue me fucking dying inside.

tl;dr A premium snapchat girl asked me for money and I gave her advice on how to better sell her body on the internet."

My professor was a prominent teacher in a specific science area. From his look and what he told us about his personal life, you could guess he was a very religious family guy, quite inhibited, and definitely not the kind of making jokes.

During his classes, students were used to prepare talks about specific topics or to send him reports. So part of our homework had to be written while the other part had to be oral.

So that day, he introduced a new project that we’ll have to prepare for the following week. But he didn’t specify which kind. So the ~~stupid~~ naive younger version of myself genuinely asked him:

**Me -** ""Excusez-moi Professeur X, voulez-vous un rapport écrit ou un rapport oral?"" *-->* Translation **COULD mean**: ""Excuse-me Professor X, would you like a written report or an oral report?"" (*Nothing crazy, huh? but definitely not what everyone understood. Real meaning further in the text)*

**Prof X -** *staying silent and starting to blush*

**The whole classroom -**  *bursting and laughing so much*

**Me -** *turning around to my classmates confused to see what funny thing I missed then going back to my professor* ""Mr X, you didn't answer to my question. Would you like an oral report?""

**Prof X -** *still silent and blushing even more* 

**The whole classroom -**  l*aughing louder*

**Me -** *More and more confused of what was so hilarious then I repeat in my mind the question I was about to ask once again because damnit I want to know what freaking kind of project he was asking us! And this is when I realize what terrible thing I've just said out loud. I was so ashamed that I instantly got the same skin condition as my professor. But it  was so funny that I ended up crying from laughing.*

&#x200B;

**THE EXPLANATION:**

""Rapport écrit"" means ""written report"" and by opposition ""Rapport oral"" would literally mean ""oral report"" ONLY if you translate word by word.

But in French, the real common comprehension for ""rapport oral"" is BLOWJOB and that's what EVERYONE understood!!! 

No you can re-read my conversation and replace oral report by blowjob. 

Yes you can make fun of me, I deserve it! 

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** During class, I thought I was asking to my teacher what kind of homework we had to do but instead I asked him if he wanted a blowjob."

I’ve made it. I’m writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. Not only did this FU happen today, it happened within the last hour. I don't see my therapist again until Friday, so you get to hear about it instead.

I work in a customer-facing position in a small office. Today’s just a regular Monday. Talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. At time being, I have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

The most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we’ll call her Jan, has been here before. Or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it’s my first time meeting her. The name on their account is Hank Junts and I feel like I’ve met him before. I *know* that I've met him before. I browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me I cannot place his face.

After about ten minutes of idle clicking, I decide to search his name on Google with the name of our city.

>“Beloved Softball Coach Hank Junts passes away in tragic fire.” 

Headline from a local news station.

*Oh my god. Maybe that’s why I’ve never met her before. Maybe he always came in instead of her.*

The article is dated December of last year.

*Jeeze, it probably has been that long since I've seen him, hasn’t it. Oh how tragic.* Jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

I wonder if I should say anything.

But I don’t have to say anything. I would credit Satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but Satan never did anything so heinous.

**In tragic news, Hank Junts, softball coach at Smith Middle School, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

At full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. I cannot catch it. The bird has knocked a vase onto Mrs. Junts’ head. The bird has knocked me on my ass. There is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

I frantically scroll trying to find the video player. Fuck. Found it. Pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*Oh yeah, that’s what he looks like.*

Jan looks up at me. I look up at Jan. The Earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

No, I’m not that lucky. I stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where I now sit red-faced and horrified. I can hear her on her cell phone. She is crying. I am crying. I fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of Horrible Things To Think About Right As I Fall Asleep.

tldr: Couldn’t remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and I played it all of ten feet from his widow.

edit: okay I hate edits but now I understand why people do them. our FAQ of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and I do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because I was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, I probably shouldn't have done that either. 

there's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean I hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.

as far as what I'm going to do next. Mrs. Junts is coming back into the office next Monday so I'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully I have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically I know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, I know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if I had any good judgement about any of this I wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.

adding another edit because my selfloathing knows no bounds. No, those are not their real names. I'm pretty dumb but I like to think I'm not *that* dumb."

I love bad food, and therefore have to run in order to eat said food without ballooning to immense proportions. On Saturday, I decided to do a long-ish run, as I was going out for my daughter's birthday, and her favorite restaurant is an all-you-can-eat place nearby our house. So, donning my cold-weather outdoor running gear, I set off on a jog, noticing that I had forgot to put on the compression underwear that I normally run with. No matter, I thought-I had sweats on and even though it was ~28 F, I was warm enough and knew that I would warm up after I started on the run.

About halfway through I had to pee, but it subsided after about 5-6 minutes, so I figured my body just said ""eh take care of it when you get home."" About ten minutes after that, I realized I could no longer feel much down there, and the tip of my penis was completely without feeling. Worrisome, I thought, so I turned my back to the road, took off my glove, and put my hands down there to investigate. It was cold as ice, and I couldn't feel anything. Turns out, not wearing underpants had made the tip of the penis spend most of its time in direct contact with my sweats, which weren't rated to any sort of weather conditions (they were just my usual ratty lounge pants). So, between the sweat from the warm parts of my legs and the tip of the penis being essentially uncovered to the elements...

I ran back to the house as fast as I could, all the while worrying that at some point that day, I would see a doctor, who would pull down his mask, use words like ""frostbite,"" ""amputation,"" and ""shockingly small,"" and I would have no choice but to be a eunuch. Once I got home, I stripped down and got into the bathroom to take a warm shower (I probably should have looked up the proper way to go about unfreezing a penis, but my mind was elsewhere). I cannot really describe the intense pain that ensued as my penis thawed, but I thought I was going to pass out. It took roughly an hour (the worst part of which was the first 5 or so minutes) to get ""normal"" feeling back, and as far as I can tell, everything is working properly as of now.

Still, the moral of the story- WEAR UNDERPANTS. They might just save your penis (if you have one).

TL:DR went for a run in below-freezing weather, forgot to wear underpants, froze penis, had to re-thaw penis and it was exceptionally painful.

Edit: I am so happy that my (possibly small) frozen penis is making some internet friends have a good laugh. Thanks for reading! And thank you, truly, for the gold and silver, I am honored that it made a few folks chuckle enough to go the extra mile. Stay safe out there, and keep your junk warm if you have it!

Edit edit: It's the squiggly line, not a minus sign, in front of the 28F. So, it was JUST below freezing, not 28 degrees below freezing. I don't mind running in the cold, but 28 below would be truly insane."

So when all this went down, my sister and I asked my mom to take a DNA test as well. She agreed. As it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. As I said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what. 

HERE IS THE KICKER THOUGH

My mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her IVF treatment. She is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. 

I’m actually sort of sad for my mom, I didn’t consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. We are her daughters of course but I can’t imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. 

So yeah, guess that’s all I have for now!

TLDR; Mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than I am. 

EDIT: I talked to my mom this morning and she’s ok, thank goodness. She said we’re still her babies! I discussed the idea of hiring a lawyer with her, she said she still has her IVF paperwork somewhere so she is looking for it. Her paper hoarding may come in handy this once! I’m just happy she is alright."

PHOTO Updates: [https://imgur.com/a/8Rv1LoZ](https://imgur.com/a/8Rv1LoZ) (I assume the first of many photos to come in the following months)

Last week, I posted one of my life's most embarrassing stories on TIFU, about the typo that caused me to donate $15,041 to a Bangladesh charity instead of the $150 donation I intended.  At the time of my Reddit post, the charity’s latest campaign had approximately $12,500 from 26 total donations.  My neighbor, the organizer of the charity, had told me the charity was running on fumes and looking to cancel some of its programs.  

Of course I had hoped some Redditors might read my story and decide to help the charity, but I NEVER could have expected the overwhelming reaction nor the incredible generosity of the Reddit community.  “Watch this post blow up, and a shit ton of Redditors donate” was one of the first comments the post received on Reddit.  And that is exactly what happened.  Over Memorial Day Weekend, the charity raised over $55,000 from over 2,100 new donations.  

On Saturday, I had to explain Reddit to my 77-year-old neighbor and to the charity’s team leader in Bangladesh (he called it Rebbit, as you can see in my pics).  They were absolutely blown away by the reaction – truly they view it as a miracle.  I received the following message from my neighbor: “Without a doubt, this is the biggest wave of support to arrive since we started! Doors that were closed can now be opened. Plans that were parked can now be put in motion. There is much we can now accomplish. All due to your idea to post (in a funny way) on what happened a while ago.  Abundant resources require an equal level of responsibility. No less. I am committed to see that these funds are applied carefully and continue to make a difference to those who need it most.”

Sometimes things just seem to work out for a reason.  One Reddit donor commented, “Michael may have screwed up his donation, but hopefully his TIFU on Reddit has fixed that somewhat.”  Thanks to Reddit, the Bangladesh community will receive roughly 4x the amount of the original donation I had refunded.  

TL;DR: My embarrassing story of an accidental $15,041 donation (and refund of $13,541) goes viral on Reddit, Redditors raise over $55,000 for needy in Bangladesh!

EDIT:  Holy cow someone just donated $5,000!  Thank you, Anonymous!!  Hopefully you didn’t mean to donate $500… it could happen to anyone.  Charity link in comments and original post, if anyone else is interested!"

My ex husband and I are close friends. He's out of town, so he asked me to house sit and take care of his dogs. I got here yesterday, got some work done on my latest project, and decided to end the day with a nice relaxing soak in the whirlpool tub. I wiped the tub down, filled it with piping hot water, added salts and a few drops of essential oils. I lit candles and poured a glass of champagne. It was beautiful. I lowered myself into the tub slowly, sank down, and sighed in happiness. Then I turn on the jets to kick everything off. I learned back, and for a few brief moments, I was in heaven. Then I opened my eyes. There were black slugs swimming in my bath. Hundreds of them. It was horrifying. I screamed like a banshee and dove out of the tub, falling to the floor. In my panic I knocked the wine glass off the tub ledge, shattering it. Now I'm naked on the floor, wet and covered in broken glass. The tub jets are still on, and now spraying the entire room with water. After managing to grip the counter and haul my ass up off the floor, I see that I have little cuts all over my legs, hands, and abdomen. Now the dogs are roused, and they are barking and jumping at the door. I tried to get ahold of myself enough to open the door, but as I do so, the largest dog pushes through, knocking me BACK on to the broken glass, so at this point I now have to do what I can to keep the dogs from getting hurt. After a moment or 2 of total panic, I get the dogs out again. When I look into the tub, I realize there are no slugs, but apparently my ex hasn't cleaned the tub jets in a looooong time, because it is absolutely full of big pieces of the disgusting shit that builds up in tub jets. Big black pieces of that horrid mix of dead skin, oils, bacteria, and other delightful residues. I honestly think slugs might be LESS gross. So instead of relaxing, I spent the night cleaning and picking glass out of my wounds. Oh, and the dogs are fine, btw. 

TL;DR...I took a bath in a whirlpool that wasn't as clean as it looked. I saw a thousand gross black slugs things floating around, panicked, dove out of the tub and ended up covered in broken glass and cuts"

I'm getting over covid and have lost a ton of weight, like a shocking amount. I still have no sense of taste and what I can only describe as a strong aversion to food. My quarantine officially ended yesterday and I am allowed to go out again so I decided to walk to the gas station near my apartment and see if some doritos and a real coke would excite me. 

Strolling along, feeling pretty great about being alive and having energy again. I was quite sick but now I'm just bored and energetic, let's take a walk, right?! Relevant to note here that I was a healthy weight before but it was a curvy lady healthy weight, now I just look like a titless, assless twig. I'm wearing a casual dress because it's formless and so still fits. 

I was feeling pretty great and kinda skip-hopped up over the curb and MY UNDERWEAR FELL DOWN AROUND MY ANKLES. THEY FELL OFF MY ASS BECAUSE MY ASS IS GONE.

A car was driving by and definitely saw. What do you even do in this situation? Kick them off and flee? Pull them up? I opted for the latter.

Tl;dr I got covid and didn't die and then my underwear fell down in public.

Edit: I am so thankful for all of your covid stories, and high five to my stranger-friends who have also had it and recovered! I'm also really, really happy that 15k people are laughing as hard as I am about the time I lost my underpants. Reddit is fantastic."

My roommate had friends over for the weekend (they're a lesbian couple and we are two guys). Yesterday afternoon they left to go out and I was home alone. I'm usually good for a stroke a day and hadn't had a chance for a few days since they'd been there. When everyone left I decided it would be a good time to break out my silicone jerk sleeve and have some fun. Did the deed and decided to go take a shower and wash it out. I set it down at the back of the tub, finished my shower, dried off and went about my day. Last night about 11:00 my roommate's friend goes and takes a shower. She goes into my roommate's bedroom and I hear muffled commotion. 
""It's not mine."" 

""What the fuck is it?""""eeewww!"" 

At this moment I knew exactly what happened. I left it on the edge of the tub. There was nothing I could do and I knew I was in for it. I covered my head and waited for then to come to me. A few minutes later I hear them come in and I start getting smacked in the head with my silicone vag and my roommate yelling at me that we have company over.. 
Once they left my room I got up and took care of putting it away. Then the girls start asking questions...

What is it like? Is it like a real vagina? Why do you have it? 
No, it's not like the real thing, but it's cheaper than a stripper and I don't need to worry about catching anything. 

Around this moment her girlfriend realizes that she was touching my sex toy that I blew a load into earlier, and admits to everyone that she fingered it when she found it. 

""Did you throw it out?""

Yes I did.

""You didn't need to throw it out.""

""Well, considering I just got beat with it and it's kinda old it's time for a new one, they tend to get worn out."" 

For the next hour or so all I could hear was them laughing at my expense in the other room. Hopefully they have gone home by the time I get out of work.

Edit: after seeing this blow up I just want to add that I'm glad it wasn't my butt plug I left out. 
They left and we're all on good terms. One of the girls never knew pocket pussies existed and spent some time browsing the internet looking at the male sex toy section.

Oh, and this is typical of my roommate, we antagonize each other to no end. We've been laughing about it and it's just a matter of time before I get him back.

Tldr: left my pocket pussy in the shower and house guest found it while taking a shower."

My brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. Needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. My 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so I let him. All of the sudden, I hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. He was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. A few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. Some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. They were scared. They were surprised. The best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. We all had a good laugh.

Mandatory edit:

Thank you for the gold.


Thank you for the condolences.


My brother´s phone line is still active, it´s in a family plan...  I won't be pestering my sister-in-law about this, she is having a hard time already and if this isn´t a issue for her, I sure won´t create one.  

TL;DR: Family freaked out thinking my deceased brother was calling them, instead it was my nephew using his phone.  "

TL;DR: I accidentally cursed due to being absent minded, my daughter's reply made me feel all sorts of different ways lol

My daughter just turned 3, her communication skills are getting better by the day. So that day for some reason her tummy was giving her issues so she was being difficult about eating. It was a cycle of her saying she was hungry, then a little back and forth about what is going to be eaten, and finally her taking one bite and saying she was done. Not even saying there was a problem, literally ""cool this was good, I'm full for the next 3 minutes"".

After applesauce, PB & J, and pasta being prepared for no reason, I got the third ""all done!"" 30 seconds after dropping the plate with her, and I got a little frustrated.

Real quick side note, I try to not give my daughter too much of the ""baby talk"" as in I don't like having to dumb things down if it's unnecessary, especially because I'm bilingual so there's a whole other layer of development that I gotta be mindful of when I freely swap languages. So I try to keep it fairly down to earth if I can, to help her in the long run, unless we are playing or some other situation where I would be in character.

ANYWAY... So I'm a little frustrated and I'm in casual mode so after the third failed meal I slip up and I go ""oh come on man, are you fucking with me?"" And without missing a beat she goes ""no. I'm not fucking with you."" and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks lol it was supposed more of a comment I mumbled to myself, but she fed it right back to me and I kinda wanted to laugh but also kinda felt embarrassed for it, while also having to   let her know that I'd prefer if she didn't say that for reasons. 

Yeah I know, it's not all that crazy, but I thought it was kinda noteworthy one way or another and couldn't think of a better sub to share it on.

Edit: this blew up, holy shit, I was just casually sharing a story, didn't think it would get this popular. There are way too many comments for me to be able to look at all of them lol"

I had not ever done marijuana until that point, and I got very, very high.

So, My fiancé of two years is a marijuana consumer, she enjoys a good buzz after work, and I enjoy a glass of whiskey and a cigar once a month, that’s just the way we are, she’s happy, I’m happy.

She had always wanted to get me stoned since our first date, since I had never tried marijuana, and I had always promised that our wedding night would be our first time getting high together.

I include this information, because I feel I need to emphasize how unprepared my body was for what happened to me.

Yesterday, I got out of the hospital due to COVID complications, I am feeling about 80% normal I’d say, congested, but normal, and I felt extremely exhausted, so I went to our bedroom and crashed out. 

When I awoke, the thirst in my mouth was sandy, and the heat from my body seemed almost leeched entirely into the bed. So I got up, and looked at my phone, as you do, and I see that it’s around 11:30 pm. I walk into my kitchen, and I get myself a giant glass of cold water. My fiancé is on video calls with her friends in the living room, foggy smoke fills the air. 

She has Oreos by her, but I am balls out naked, and if I were to go, her webcam would surely capture the shmeat and broadcast it to four women and a flamboyantly gay man enjoying their night. 

But I’m sleepy and I want sweets

So in my stupor, I open the snack cupboard, and grab... peach rings, that’s all the bag says on the top, (brand)Peach Rings. 

I popped one in my mouth, and grabbed two more, and put the baggy back in the cabinet, and scuttled off, but after the second peach ring, the aftertaste was bitter, I figured they were just sugar free, but because I have a mild allergic reaction to some sweeteners, I decided to go back to read the ingredients on the back of the package:

On the FRONT OF THE BAG it actually says (brand) THC INFUSED peach rings, 60 mg... my initial thoughts weren’t so abnormal, 60 mg sounds like nothing, like if I took a 60 mg ibuprofen that would barely be any ibuprofen, right? So my logic was that it would be like taking almost nothing

So I called my fiancé into the room with me, and I told her what happened, she told me to eat something right away, she ended up warming me up some Chef Boyardee Ravioli, and sat me down at our dining table, and I pulled out my phone to watch something. 

Between bites of nuclear tomato sauce and super-processed meat filled pasta, I picked up my phone and went to type “king of the hill” on Hulu. 

I got three letters in and suddenly it felt like I had just had my hand in the snow, you know that numb sensation that makes you feel like your hand is a lot fatter or wider than it is? I couldn’t muster the dexterity to type anymore

Then I looked over to my fiancé, and it was like a laggy video game, I moved, but my vision didn’t keep up with my movement, like 30 seconds later I was mentally where my body was. 

I could only say what I felt in that moment, a long and whispery “Noooooooooooo~”

That got the attention of my lover, who looked at me and said “how does your nose feel”, which cued me to touch my nose, it felt like it was feet away from my eyes. 

>From here, my memory gets spotty, but here’s how I remember the rest of the night: 

The time on my phone was now 12:45 am

my fiancé tells me to finish my food, and I did, but every bite felt it was minutes long

When I ate all of my ravioli, I said I wanted to go to bed

Suddenly- I am in bed and I look at my phone, it’s 12:50, this upset me, I remember trying to reason with my feelings, because I felt like it should have been much later

My fiancé comes into the bedroom, I ask her how I got there

She laughs

I blink

She’s gone

I call for her

She’s next to the bed now, and I get an overwhelming sense of dread in my gut and chest, everything is spinning 

She tells me I’ll be okay, and touches my head

In close my eyes for what feels like a long while, I open them, 

She’s still in the same position, over me, playing with my hair.

It’s 1:15 am, and I am relatively lucid, and paranoia is just barely getting his Dick lubed up for me 

At some point I wanted to cuddle with my woman, because I felt like I was somewhat safe when we were closely embraced.

>from this point forward this is what she says happened 

“You wanted me to cuddle but your fever was so hot I couldn’t just spoon you in good conscience, but you tucked your face into my neck and the rest of your body was diagonal across the bed”

“You asked how long the feeling would last, I told you that you weren’t even at your peak yet, and you cried, which is so not you, you don’t cry, which got me panicked” 

“You asked me to read the back of the package to you, and when I got up to go get it, you stopped me and asked me where I was going, when I told you, you said okay, then when I got back, you asked me where I went”

“You said thank you for the macaroni about 10 times, and I said you’re welcome, but then I asked /what macaroni/ your final time, which made you talk about how they don’t eat meat sauce on their spaghetti in Italy” 

“You told me that if you died of Rona, that you didn’t want me to tell your mom and dad you did weed” 

“You asked me to read a Wikipedia article about how to stop a weed overdose, which I couldn’t find because it doesn’t exist”

“I made you chew on black peppercorns, because it makes some people sober up, but you just kept saying you couldn’t taste it”

“At about 2-2:30 am, you just kept asking me how long it had been every 2-5 minutes, then you fell asleep, and you’d wake up and then wake me up periodically to tell me you think it’s going away”

And that’s how it went for an few hours

>things I apparently hallucinated while awake and did not dream like I thought I did

The bed filling with water like a waterbed

My sisters coming over but hiding from me

My phone ringing

The window (second story) being tapped on 

My dad coming in the room and saying things to me like “I’m disappointed in you”

The room moving in twisty ways, or like I was floating on a boat

>in conclusion 

It’s now been 16 hours and I still feel a little off

My fiancé says there are things she won’t tell me about my time on my trip, things she wants to keep to herself, she says they aren’t about her or me, but she thinks that they are a big part of who I am, and that she loves me even more because, she says she has seen my realest self

Also, I was in hysterics at a few points in the night, and she doesn’t want me to feel too embarrassed

Thanks for reading.

Edit: This will be my only edit,  firstly, thank you for everyone that gave an award, the most I’ve ever gotten in my life. 

Secondly, 

I cannot express my love for every comment that I have received, and will receive. I am still coming down off of the edibles and this thread has taken me on a completely different trip of its own. A lot of you have stories, a lot of you have said some really encouraging things, some of you have skeptical takes, and all of these things are welcome, to discuss this moment of my life has been extremely rewarding."

Also I'm on mobile blah blah. 

I'm not very good at using Snapchat for it's intended purpose but I like to post dumb videos of my two dogs being cute or goofy. I especially like to use the filter that makes glitter or stars sparkle across the screen. 

So a few weeks ago the hubby and I are just chilling in the bed, petting our Pomeranian. He had just gotten out of the shower and it's a hot day so he's just chilling, legs spread, with his Jurassic Pork out.

Pancake (our pom) starts rooting into the blanket and being adorable, so I whip out my phone and start to record on Snapchat. I get a few seconds and do a quick zoom into her face because it's hilarious. Then I post it to my story, send a copy to my husband and close the app. 

About an hour later he picks up his phone and starts to scroll. I'm not really paying attention to him and it's really quiet. All of a sudden he just screams ""YOU POSTED MY DICK ON SNAPCHAT"". I just giggle and say ""haha real funny"". Then I thought about it for a second and realized what happened. I started laughing so hard I was crying and I couldn't breathe. 

I open my phone to look and sure enough in the corner of the video you can see my husband's meat thermometer just hanging out in the corner, glitter filter and all. This brought on another bout of crying laughter and he decided to take my phone away. 

We deleted the video, then he records himself explaining what happened and that he hopes everyone that viewed my story enjoyed the show. He then shames me and points the camera to me and I'm hiding my face and still laughing. 

I feel like I should mention that we both found this hilarious and no one is angry. It's definitely an interesting story to tell everyone who missed out. 

TL;DR: Posted a video to my Snapchat story of my dog being a goof while my husband laid in bed naked and got his womb broom on camera.

This morning my mom messaged me to ask if I could come over and update the antivirus software on her PC. I agreed to drop in when I'm done working.

Fast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. While I was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. 

The update was taking forever so I decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. It was a mess. Dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. I couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. It was enough to summon the OCDemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. 

So, as I was organizing my mom's shit, I noticed a folder called ""Mom's Recipes"". Now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. I figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.

I opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. Now, I'll be honest, I'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when I see the words ""mom"" and ""recipes"", I imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. NOT...

""I'm a woman, I'm a widow, I'm a mother, I'm over 50, and I'm still the whore next door""

This was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called ""recipes"". It was an ominous sign that I should not read any fucking further. I read further. It became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. I made it through the first two pages before the ""recipe book"" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. 

I closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. My mom invited me stay for dinner but I declined. All I could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. I think I need to end our relationship now. 

TL;DR Read my mom's recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock."

My roommates and I were sitting on the couch after taking some rips and were just chatting. I, being absolutely zooted, turned to my roommate and asked him what he thinks about to keep himself from nutting when he and his girlfriend do the deed. And to which he gave a quite reasonable answer of, “I just stare at a wall and let my mind go blank.” 

Where this takes a horrible turn is when he asked me the same thing. At which point I turned to him and confessed that I think about Tarzan. Specifically the part of the movie when Tarzan is sliding down the vines and the song “Son of Man” is playing in the background. I can’t say for certain why this image always pops up in my head, but it has never failed me so far.

Cue the eruption of laughter as all of my roommates are baffled by my method. Everyone immediately started looking up the video on YouTube and showing me the clip of Tarzan sliding down the vines, which made me very flaccid indeed.

In the weeks after, every time I bring my girlfriend to our house and go upstairs, my phone is bombarded with messages from my roommates sending me gifs of Tarzan sliding down the vines. I’m worried that this will not end anytime soon, as I haven’t been able to get it up ever since.

TLDR : I told my roommates that I think about Tarzan to keep myself from nutting too early."

I had a bowl today, before inviting a guy I've been casually seeing.

He comes over and we get all excited. He loves oral, so I start sucking, and he's moaning, so I'm thinking he's into it, right? Well, his moaning gets louder and he starts pushing on my head, so I assume that means keep going, and go harder. So I do that.

Finally, he yells ""FUCK!"" And pushes me away. He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it? I was really confused, while he went to the bathroom to go see what was going on. And my eyes see the opened ramen pack in the kitchen trash bin, and I realize the spice/pepper must've still been in my mouth and probably burned him.

He comes out cursing, asking me what the fuck was wrong with me. I apologized and explained I didn't realize my eating ramen could hurt him. He left, and I'm a little disappointed. But also now I'm hungry again and eating another bowl of Korean fire noodles with extra chili flakes

TL;DR: burned a guy's dick after eating Korean fire noodles

So my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. She lives up in Ohio and we reside in Florida. Well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

The last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

Now to the fuck up.

I thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working Wii and Wii sports game for the next time she visits.

So I text her: 

Me: Hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

Her: What's that?

Me: Bowl me! If you think you stand a chance. >:)

Her: Excuse me?

Me: You heard me, lol.

So 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

I never said ""Bowl me"" oh no dear Reddit, I wrote ""Blow me""

Luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

TL;DR: Got Wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of Bowl me."

When I shower I listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. Midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. I'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. After she finished she asked to come into the shower, but I was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes I'm a guy, I just don't like body hair) and told her no because I had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. She said fine and walked away. Shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and I hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. This is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""Top 3 Minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" Sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. I got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. This behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before I was finally able to get my phone back.

EDIT: First time using reddit, color me impressed. I did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! This is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that I've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. Her go-to video is '3 Hours of Farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. I am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and I'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. For those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. Our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. We've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

TL;DR, I married a middle schooler in a 23 year old woman's body and got dabbed on."
khivmt,TIFU I killed the best relationship in my life because she complimented me,29856,0.78,2669,2020-12-21 20:23:37,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/khivmt/tifu_i_killed_the_best_relationship_in_my_life/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/khivmt/tifu_i_killed_the_best_relationship_in_my_life/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"So I was in my early 20s, been seeing this girl for a few months, our sexual chemistry was on point we enjoyed each other’s company immensely but timing was just off as we both had plans of relocation that were set in motion before we met. So we stayed as FWB

So there we were one night laying in bed in post coitus bliss, after what was probably the best sex we have ever had, our breaths still heavy. She seemed more coquettish than her usual self, snuggling her body close to me in a tight embrace, she softly told me that I am the only man for her and she wanted our relationship to be exclusive from that moment on.

Assuming my charm and sexual prowess brought about this turn of events, I was beaming with confidence, my ego stoked by my apparent ascendency to near sex god status. In what I imagine being one of my most effortlessly cool and devilishly masculine moments,  I replied “to what do I owe this honour?

She proceeded to regail details of her weekend escapade, a girl’s night out with her old sorority sisters where the night ended with her drunk out of her face hooking up with this French Algerian guy. Then she described the shock and horror when his penis inevitably made its debut. Apparently it was 12 inches long and thicker than a coke can. She said she was frightened by it, that it looked like a torture instrument that would tear her apart. Apparently the mood soured soon after that, and he left her place awkwardly.

Now I pack a standard issue 6 incher with some room for expansion depending on my level of arousal, never had any complaints from previous partners which by then was a significant number, there never was any reason for me to second guess my sexual abilities. I did have an acute awareness of being a grower and not a shower, buying into the porn skewered reality that bigger is better, whatever latent insecurities I had was magnified and put on display . My breaking point came as these words uttered from her lips  “I kid you not he was probably twice as big as yours”, it carved deep into my consciousness with animated violence, overwhelming me with feelings of inadequacies, clouding my ability to control my most basic faculties. She then said something about how much she anticipated my visit and how she thinks she is falling for me blah, blah, blah. She ended her confession by teasingly going down on me kissing my flaccid cock telling it “this is all I will ever need”. 

I don’t think I have ever felt so small in my life. I got out of bed, got dressed In abject silence and just left the room without saying a word. This of course left her in a state of confusion. I never called her again and blocked her on all my social media counts. I spent the next few days at home in crippling depression wallowing in self pity, rejection and inadequacies. 


Thinking back, now a far more secured man in my 30s, I often second guess my reaction. Was I being an insecure drama queen?. There i was, just had the most amazing sex in my life, this gorgeous girl I really liked was pouring her heart out, praising the superiority of my average sized member whilst professing her love for me. Yet the only image in my head is her staring with wide eyes at the sheer size of his monster dong. Once the image got stuck in my bead , my ego blinded by the green eyed monster, there was no turning back.

Edit and afterthought:  To address some common questions: 

The fateful night took place some 15 years ago. We were both getting ready to start our new lives in different countries. So any form of commitment then would take the form of a long distance relationship. 

I am sure her intent was not malicious, she probably thought she was being sultry and sexy and hey, what is youth without a few awkward and misguided episodes? 

I certainly could have handled the situation with more finesse, but thats the nature of fear, insidious in its grapple, my emotional and mental faculties went into complete paralysis, I saw retreat as the only option. It was cowardly and I am not proud of it. 

We are connected through the grapevines of social media, but none of us reached out to each other, I guess both of us being seemingly happy in our marriage played a big role. 

Many people have questioned my motives in writing this with accusations of sensationalism and fabrication. The simple answer to that is, I am currently going through a divorce and the business I spent years building closed down a month ago. Symptoms of the pandemic blues often manifest as nostalgia, writing and sharing my stories here on reddit have been rather therapeutic. 

I would like to thank everyone for sharing your thoughts and lending me your perspective,to those who shared their own personal stories, I would try my best to reply on a more personal level but given the sheer volume, may prove difficult. To those generous souls I thank you for the rewards, its been heartwarming. 

TL:DR May have missed out on the best relationship in my life due to my insecurities."

Not a fuck up that just happened, but one that I just realized happened. 

This Christmas season, and like the last few, I did almost at all of my shopping via Amazon. For friends and family that live far away I had their gifts shipped right to their house.

After spending more that I should this holiday season I haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. I remembered I had a $50 Amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. I ended up with around $70 (Puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. A few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. 

Like I said that was last week. But as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. So I checked my order and it says that it arrived. I was pissed. I had issues with delivery in the past. But I live in a small apartment building and I didn't think anyone would take my boxes. 

And then I noticed the address it shipped to. Apparently Amazon auto filled in the last address I used:

 my Reddit Secret Santa. 

So one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. If you could return them  PM me. I'd appreciate it. Otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.

TL;DR my secret santa got a surprise gift."
ej2zcz,TIFU by informing my family I was engaged with a dick pic.,29834,0.92,741,2020-01-03 01:06:20,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ej2zcz/tifu_by_informing_my_family_i_was_engaged_with_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ej2zcz/tifu_by_informing_my_family_i_was_engaged_with_a/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Naturally, this TIFU didn’t actually happen today. 

This happened about two weeks ago. Honestly, the moment it happened I considered writing this post, but felt that in light of making the mistake of sending my johnson out, I might give myself some time to make sure I want this to live online forever.

My family has already told just about everyone they know the story, so I figured I'd bring all of you into the fold.

So, here we go.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years, and I'm deeply in love with this girl. She is decent beyond words, fun, funny and frankly I couldn't imagine a better relationship.

Her mother had offered me her grandmother's ring for our engagement, which I considered a tremendous honour. After dealing with the anxiety of toting around a family heirloom for 2 weeks and leaving it in the possession of a jeweller for cleaning and resizing, I just wanted to get the engagement over with.

I know that might not sound like the most romantic way of describing my engagement, but I was nervous.

I get home, get down on one knee, and she says yes.

It was a moment I won't soon forget...then...then I got creative on really burning it into my memory.

Now, in my opinion, everyone more or less does their engagement announcements the same way. Holding hands close up with a ring on, or the couples pic with the open hand across the dudes chest with the ring visible, ""it's been done to death"" I thought.

I proposed to my now fiancée that we do something funny and different, and she agrees.

We settle on taking a picture of me completely naked, laying in bed, with her hand in the foreground covering my crotch with the ring on. The picture is hilarious, and we send it to my family group chat.

I mean, this is my naked body afterall. Clearly, for my families eyes only.

As it turns out, the picture was taken on 'live mode'. When you held it down, my girlfriends hand would move out of the way, leaving a perfect shot of me, as naked as the day I was born, grinning from ear to ear, doing finger guns.

I received a message from my brother-in-law informing us that the picture is live, that my sister was the one to discover it, and he follows it up with a picture of her in a shocked state of bewilderment.

My mother got it too, same mistake.

Her first, unsolicited dick pic, at the age of 61...from her son, no less.

Needless to say, it's a story that will be told despite my protests for the remainder of my days.

TL;DR my fianée and I took a perfectly positioned photo of her engagement ring covering my package, only to have 'live mode' ruin it all."
uz2n3r,TIFU: by thinking peanut butter was supposed to be spicy,29829,0.93,2013,2022-05-27 22:28:12,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uz2n3r/tifu_by_thinking_peanut_butter_was_supposed_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uz2n3r/tifu_by_thinking_peanut_butter_was_supposed_to_be/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory: this happened a few months back.

Ever since I was a kid I loved how peanut butter used to taste. Not only did it taste good, but it had this weird ""spice,"" to it that wasn't like a chili pepper type spice, but wholly unique that I never tasted in other foods. It was the perfect accent when mixed with jelly, as the spiciness and the sweetness went together perfectly. Sometimes I'd ""eat too fast,"" and have a bit of a hard time breathing, but I never thought anything of it. I also remember getting some weird looks a few times as a kid talking about spicy peanut butter, but didn't think anything of that either.

One day a few months ago, I (25m) was staying at my parents house and went to make myself some lunch. I saw some peanut butter in the pantry, but no jelly so since I was hungry I slammed about an inch of peanut butter between two slices of bread and remember thinking ""wow, this is the most peanut butter I've ever eaten at once,"" but then got to work devouring my creation.

This is where the fuckup starts. A few bites in I got that ""ate too fast,"" feeling again and had to take a break to catch my breath. I started eating again and immediately got the ate-too-fast feeling again. *Damn, it's going to take me forever to eat this sandwich* I thought, so I became determined to just power through and finish it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Big Mistake.

I made it to about the half way point before I knew something was wrong. It felt simultaneously like there was a rock stuck in my windpipe and like somebody had filled my lungs with peanut butter. Weezing and struggling to breath, it fucking *hurt*. The amount of time it took to take a full breath was causing me to panic and felt like I was trying to fill up a hot air balloon with a straw. I immediately started googling ""heart attack symptoms,"" but they didn't really match up. I then googled the symptoms themselves and results of ""symptoms of allergic reactions,"" started coming up. Some of the main symptoms were difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. Then I scrolled further down and saw a section about ""things to watch out for in children,"" and the top one was... the child says their ""mouth feels hot,"" or that they say non-spicy food is spicy.

After a painfully long period of time I started being able to breath again and suddenly all the weird looks I got from talking about spicy peanut butter made sense! Peanut butter wasn't spicy, I'd just been poisoning myself all these years! I now use peanut butter alternatives and mix my jelly with ""sweet Asian chili jelly,"" I pick up from the store and it's just as good, but doesn't almost kill me.

TLDR: I thought peanut butter was supposed to taste spicy, turns out I'm just an idiot and allergic to it.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards! Also glad I could help some people realize the signs of allergies. 

EDIT 2: A lot of people were asking why I didn't immediately call an ambulance. Remember, this was something that happened all the time and I thought was normal, so it took about 30 seconds of me waiting for it to go away, then realizing it wasn't and drinking some water (40-120 seconds now), before I even went to get my phone. By this point it had actually started to get better (slowly, but noticeably) so I knew I was in the clear. This is why I googled 'heart attack,"" as it was my understanding that some of those symptoms can be transient."
6p1om1,TIFU By Farting During Mass and Making the Priest Laugh,29804,0.87,859,2017-07-23 20:23:13,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6p1om1/tifu_by_farting_during_mass_and_making_the_priest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6p1om1/tifu_by_farting_during_mass_and_making_the_priest/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This actually happened about an hour ago. I'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

So...I'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when I feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

No biggie, this has happened before, I'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. But alas, my body had other plans.

We stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, I'm starting to panic, not sure if I can hold it. We finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as I land on the pew...

IT HAPPENED!

Now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel's trumpet.

The church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

The priest stands up at his chair, says ""I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.

At this point I decide it's a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

TL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church. "
s0slrj,TIFU by saving my neighbors life,29783,0.92,1370,2022-01-11 01:13:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/s0slrj/tifu_by_saving_my_neighbors_life/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/s0slrj/tifu_by_saving_my_neighbors_life/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"For starters this literally just happened ten minutes ago, and be ready to buckle up because boy is this one long.

So, my fianceé (F29) and I (M30) have lived in our current apartment for 8 months and have had a pretty decent experience overall. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the neighbors that moved in about four months ago. Just to set the stage for what we have been going through, these neighbors throw parties that start at 4:00 am and end at 2:00 pm all the time and when they aren't having their parties they are just blaring music loud enough to make Hellen Keller ask them to STFU all day long. Both my fiancé and I work from home, so this can get incredibly annoying, but nevertheless we solider on. 

Which brings us to today. Today I noticed from my office that there is a persistent beeping. After about five minutes I go to the living room and ask my fiancé if that was our neighbors smoke detector. She said that she thinks so, so I went to investigate.

I go out in the hall and notice that the sound is coming from their apartment, but I don't smell any smoke and the door is cold to the touch. So I figure they have it under control and go back to my apartment to continue working. About twenty minutes later I notice it is still going off (and by this point my dog is freaking the fuck out) so I go back to the hallway, smell smoke, and courageously bang on the door. No answer. I continue banging on the door but no one is responding.

So I do the only logical thing and call maintenance. I give maintenance man (henceforth MM) the run down on the days events and he says he'll be right over. Problem solved right? Wrong! Because this dear listeners is when the story gets fun.

MM arrives, goes to the neighbors apartment, and does his maintenance thing. When no one answers he goes in and the horrid smoke detector finally stops. I am just about set to go back to my work when all of a sudden there is a knock on my door. 

I open it to find MM standing there on the phone telling another member of maintenance to get the police and ambulance on their way over because he thinks ""the kid next door is dead"". MM then looks at me and says ""I need you to come in here with me incase he is faking and attacks.""

Now, I have been in some fights in my youth but I am in no means someone who is prepared to duke it out with anyone holding any kind of weapon. Not to mention the fact that MM has a good 2 feet and 120 lbs. on me so if he goes down I'm all but fucked. So naturally I do the responsible thing and agree to go with MM.

We enter an apartment FILLED with smoke and I see a burnt pot on a stove covered in the foam from a fire extinguisher. Apparently a fire had started and MM put it out and opened all the windows to try to get rid of the smoke.

And, sure enough, passed out on the floor, is one of my fucking neighbors (henceforth Fire Starter a kid I am assuming is around 23). MM proceeds to shake and nudge Fire Starter in an attempt to get a response. But this kid ain't moving folks. We're in there for at least five minutes trying to get this kid up, so eventually MM tells whoever he is on the phone with to ""get the ambulance and police over here now"".

Apparently, ""police"" was the magic word because Fire Start wakes the fuck up and goes agro on MM. MM takes it like a champ and proceeds to tell Fire Starter he is a dumbass and almost burning down a building is not okay. Fire Starter just keeps yelling for MM to get the fuck out (I had beyond backed out into the hall at this point). MM keeps his cool and just keeps saying ""man we just saved your life show some goddamn respect"".

Fire Starter then asks for MM's name so he can report him, which MM gave, then asked for my name so he can report me for trespassing. MM refused to give my name saying ""he's the only reason you're alive right now you useless shit"". To which Fire Starter grabs a kitchen knife and starts waiving it at MM. MM keeps his cool, collects his keys, and walks off all while Fire Starter chases him down the stairs being an incoherent little shit. In the meantime I have predictably retreated to my own apartment only to have Fire Starter standing outside my door screaming ""I know where you live you piece of shit"".

Good times.

TL;DR Dumb ass young violent neighbor passed out and caught his stove on fire, I called maintenance thereby saving his life, and now I am looking for a new place to live.

Update: Just got done giving my statement to the police. Thank you to everyone who was asking for updates. It’s for sure a fucked up tale that is far from over. I’ll provide updates as I hear things.

Update 2: There has been a cop outside the apartment building all morning. Haven’t heard anything from inside today though. 

Update 3: Haven’t updated for a while because I was waiting on confirmation but Fire Starter was evicted. We noticed someone moving out about a week later but didn’t see who it was and yesterday noticed another couple moving in. Haven’t met them yet but I also haven’t heard a peep from their apartment even with them unloading. So they are already better than our last neighbor.

Acknowledgement: Yes we should have called the fire department first. We didn’t because this is not the first time their smoke detector has just gone off. Usually they let it beep the whole time they cook, but it has never gone off that long before."

She was gorgeous and she seemed very fun and outgoing but she did have a investment girl boss vibe to her (and that's ok but I should've seen it coming). 

I asked her for a coffee date and she says yes, we meet up and she looks good but not exactly like her photos, no problem there let's see if we connect I thought.

The first 10mins goes great, conversation is flowing and I ask her if she wants some coffee (after all we're at a coffee shop on a coffee date), she says no, because she had some earlier (first red flag, I mean who goes on a coffee date but drinks some just before the actual date?)

A tells me to go and get one for myself if I want. Alright no problem, I go and get my coffee and when I come back, there's another girl at our table. 

She says, hey this is my partner (we'll call her B), I was working with her earlier. That's when it hit me that this wasn't a date lol.

B starts asking me questions about my job, my studies and asks me If I would listen to their business plan so that I could make more money each month (lmao).

So she takes out a notepad and starts explaining me their business model and how much money I would make If I would find 3 other persons who would find 3 other people themselves, etc. 

I straight up tell her : ""So this is like a pyramid scheme right? This ain't no date?"" To which A responds : ""Oh it is a date but you seemed like a cool person to become our partner (lmao what) and this isn't a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level-marketing (MLM)"". Okay so exactly the same thing. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me.

Oh boy, so I sat there for legit 15 more mins and listened to them explain to me how I could make up to 5k a month if I were to get 100 people to join this business.

I told them I had to leave to go to the vet with my dog. They didn't seem happy that I wasn't interested in their MLM lmao. I laughed so much on the way home that I was crying. 

TLDR : Went on a coffee date with a gorgeous girl from Tinder and when I went to get my coffee she texted her business partner to come and pitch me their pyramid scheme business model for 30mins.

Edit 1 : Thank you so much for the awards, upvotes and comments! I did report A's profile on Tinder as spam as soon as I got home. The product they were trying to sell were some vitamins, proteins, Omega-3 tablets and some ""very good collagen"" lol."

I've named my houseplants and the most used things in my house. My best friend finds the habit funny and has started doing it herself to some extent.

Well a few weeks ago I was looking for a new vibrator and found one I liked and ordered it. I have a close relationship with my best friend and we talk about everything together so I also told her about this new purchase. I of course gave the vibrator a name, Billy.

Well Billy finally arrived in the mail a few days ago and I gave it test run. Billy was great, nothing to complain about. Later I was texting my friend and she asked me about my vibrator and if it was any good since she was contemplating whether to get one herself. She texted me with ""Did you try Billy already, was he worth it?"" To which I replayed: ""Yeah Billy was great, a bit expensive but I'd say he was definitely worth it. Good when ""my boyfriends name"" is not around haha""

Now that doesn't sound too weird if you know that Billy is a vibrator. My boyfriend of two months unfortunately didn't know that. 

My boyfriend saw the texts without me knowing and confronted me a few days later. He was angry asking me how I could cheat on him and basically broke up with me while I was standing there like an idiot trying to figure out what was going on. I asked him what the hell he was talking about and he started shouting at me about me fucking some prostitute called Billy.

That was when I realized what had happened and all I could do was laugh. I explained to him through my laughter that Billy was my vibrator I had named, not another man I was sleeping with. After a lot of explaining he finally understood the situation and calmed down. He now knows about my weird habit of naming things.

Tldr; I named my new vibrator Billy and texted my friend about it. My boyfriend saw the texts and thought I was cheating on him with a male prostitute.

Edit: I appreciate your concerns about my relationship. It's always nice to see that people care. But like I have said in the comments, we both have each others permission to use each others phones to a certain extent. He saw the texts by accident and I trust him since he hasn't given me any reasons not to. This issue has been talked about between the two of us and that's all I'm going to say about it."

My body lets out the loudest, longest, nastiest fart of my life and all the pain goes away.

I'm not joking when I tell you it filled the entire car with the stench of rotten eggs and death. 

My poor partner is choking for air as we turn around and go home. They're not mad at me but I feel awful for it. I'm gonna get up early and make them a good breakfast as an apology and luckily they have today off.

This happened over a few months, and I only found out he was my second cousin because he died.

Okay. So. I met this guy on Grindr, had a good chat, and really had a good vibe, and moved over to Telegram. As horny gay dudes do, we traded pictures, like, chatted a bit on the phone, etc.

&#x200B;

A last month, I check Telegram, and our chat is gone. I though, guess I was blocked :/

Same day, I found out, my second cousin, who turned out to have the same name, died that night.

&#x200B;

Okay. Spooky, but nothing solid. So, I ask my family about him. More things...

Same interests, same area of growing up, same age.

&#x200B;

Now, this is getting bad. I didn't like this, no proof it is him still though...

&#x200B;

Last week, the funeral. My Father was close to him when they were young, as he grew up with him as his Father, my Grandfather, was close with him Brother, but they haven't chatted for years.

&#x200B;

So, I was asked to go since he was family...

&#x200B;

It's him.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Sexted with a dude for a few months, turns out he was my second cousin, found out because he died.

&#x200B;

Edit: Since I saw some confusion and questions, I thought I would edit this.

I found out about the death the same day he disappeared. I have no idea why I was blocked, maybe he wanted to ghost, or someone else did it. I just assumed ghosted until the funeral, when I saw it was actually him last week.

We are not required to have video in the online class, so we just connect our microphones. Today, my bed, was extremely comfortable. As I got up at 10 am to join the online meeting in Zoom, my bed started calling me. I fucking felt it. I joined, and didn't mute myself. Normally I'd mute myself because I have a parrot. My parrot is an Indian Ringneck, and those bastards are loud as fuck. I decided to fall asleep through the whole class as my bed felt so good.  Only after I woke up an hour after the class I realised I was still in the meeting with an unmuted microphone. I texted one of my classmates and they told me they couldn't have a normal class, and the teacher didn't know how to kick me out. They also said they tried talking with the parrot, they told me he said ""Hello"" and ""What you doing"" and then proceeded to repeat ""ok"" for the duration of the class. 

TLDR: I joined my online class, forgot to mute myself, slept, and my parrot was screaming all throughout it.

EDIT: Talked with my teacher to explain her what the hell was going on and she told me she hadn't muted me because she wanted to have fun with the parrot. I guess teachers can get lonely in such depressing times.

The firm of solicitors I worked at were part of a big chain who produced free wills via workplace offers and trade union deals. People would fill out a form, send it in and we would construct their will based on the preferences on the form.

I was sharing an office with an attractive, funny and smart young woman (23) who gave me the appropriate training to complete these wills. At the time i was 46. 

She had dumped her boyfriend of several years because she found out he had been sleeping with someone else while she was at university. Their home town was several hundred miles away.  During her brief period of being single she asked me what sort of age gap between people was acceptable. We had long conversations about it. I told her i knew of couples who were 5, 10, 12, 15 and 17 years older/younger than their wife/husband/partner.

She then mentioned that she had heard that centuries ago older men often married.much younger women as they were more able to take care of said younger woman who was more likely to survive childbirth and go on to be a good mother while the more mature husband's income kept them comfortable. 

She kept asking my opinion and asked if I would ever consider seeing a younger/older woman than me. Not thinking it very likely I just shrugged and avoided the question.

Throughout the months we worked together we often went out after work and at the weekends in a group. She would dress very provocatively and on the occasions she wore stockings she would let me know she was (I'd previously confessed to having a particular weakness/fondness for them). After several months she got onto a Solicitors training programme and left. We kept in touch and met on occasions for food, coffee or drinks. 

After a couple of years she met someone at her new firm and we stopped meeting. They got married and had a baby.

I bumped into her about an hour ago in court. I was delivering some papers and she was there representing a client. She was all over me and insisted we had coffee and a chat. It was then that she told me that the reason for asking about big age gap relationships was that she had a massive crush on me but was too scared of damaging our friendship by doing anything about it but hoped that I would. When she finally decided it wasnt going to happen she left.

Of course I had absolutely no idea this was going on and that this gorgeous young woman had any interest in me beyond friendship. Honestly, I could cry.

TL:DR Made friends with hot girl in the office, didn't notice she had a crush on me."

To preface, this happened yesterday and I’m still processing and trying to come to terms with the fact that this is what I have to live with moving forward with my life. 

I had a stressful week with school, work, running errands, arranging pet sitting while I’ll be gone, numerous other unnecessary stressors, change of plans, and packing for my week long trip to VA. Yesterday in particular was super stressful, I came home from an overnight stay at a new sexual partner’s place, Nick. I was texting Nick, my best friend, my sister in law, my step mom, and my dad all at the same time. 

You can probably already guess what happened...

I was texting Nick, we were reflecting on the night before and my dad suddenly texted wishing my sister and I a safe trip and all that good stuff. I finished my text to Nick and was replying to my best friend who I had already been texting prior to my dad. While I was texting my best friend, I received a question mark reaction (iPhone) text from my dad, which left me confused for a split second because I haven’t responded to him yet. Low and behold, of course I sent the inappropriate text to me dad instead of to Nick!!!!!!!

FML!!!!!! I am mortified to say the least! My soul left my body. I screamed my lungs out for the next 10 minutes, trying to decide if this is the sign to jump off the bridge. 


Sorry dad, you don’t deserve more gray hairs. 

 [Screenshots of the text](https://imgur.com/gallery/XVHO9O2)

You’re welcome to cringe with me and laugh at me.

TL;DR sent my dad an inappropriate text that was supposed to be for my partner.

UPDATE. This blew up way more than expected. I hope you all had a great laugh at my mega cringe moment. 
Yes, I’m OK. 
Thank you to all that reached out and were concerned for my safety. I will get tested as soon as I get back home from my trip and yes I will end the relationship."

I was on a zoom call with my class this morning. Now, I haven't been up this early in a while so I was really groggy. I put my camera off and muted myself because I really just wasn't arsed to put up with it. Then it happened.

I felt a gurgling in my stomach. Realised what needed to happen. I gotta break the wind.

 I had a plan: mute myself, release the toxic gas and unmute myself as if nothing happened.

I clicked the mute button, let it rip and unmuted myself again as if nothing happened. There was an eerie silence in the zoom call, then some people started giggling. I knew something was wrong, then I realised my issue and where I fucked up.

I was already on mute from when I joined the call. When I muted AGAIN, I had actually unmuted myself. I was so tired I just didn't think about it.

Everyone heard me free the beast. Everyone. It was like I had done it in an actual class. I was mortified and immediately left and haven't joined back. I'm expecting an email from my teacher on the issue, but I'm not sure he really wants to. I'll update if he does.

Everyone watched me, out of the blue, unmute myself, cut the cheese and then mute myself again. This is the worst thing to happen to me throughout lockdown.

Tl;Dr : I was tired and needed to fart in a zoom call. I unmuted myself(thinking I had muted myself) and farted in front of my whole class."

So I had a friend that was a pretty shady guy but a good friend nonetheless, we'd known each other all through high school, we sorta went our separate ways after graduation but would occasionally call just to check in or go to a party together. 

So one day he calls me out of the blue and he says ""hey man I'm in a tight spot do you have a onion I can buy real quick"" I look in the fridge and say ""yea I've got 4 how many do you need?"" he says ""damn bro I didn't know you had it like that, I need one for now but might need more later how much you gonna charge me"" I tell him just give me a dollar and he gets super excited like ""hell yea man you've always been a good friend bro"" he says he'll be there in 30 minutes and we hang up.

Of course I'm thinking why tf is he so excited about a fucking onion... Whatever maybe he's making meatloaf and forgot to buy onions. So he pulls up 30 minutes later and I go outside with the onion in my hand feeling pretty good about helping my friend out. He flips tf out like ""WTF IS THIS!! ARE YOU TRYNA RIP ME OFF!! ARE YOU A FUCKING FED!! I'm standing there confused as fuck"" bro you said you wanted a damn onion what's the problem"" at that point I think he realized what was happening and says ""fuck you bro you wasting my time"" and speeds off.

Still in a state of shock I go in the house thinking maybe he want a different type of onion than the one I had. I call my dad and explain the weirdness of what just happened he laughs for a good 10 minutes straight TURNS OUT a ""onion"" is a unit of measurement for cocaine and ""a dollar"" in that context means a hundred dollars which is way below the market value. Who knew? Never talked to or heard from him again (he's in prison now) 

Anyway there must be something about my demeanor that screams drug dealer because all throughout my adult life people have just assumed I had drugs for sale, especially at parties but sometimes just randomly on the street. It's weird af but I've just gotten used to it at this point. I remember some really old guy when I was 11-12yo telling me I'd make a good drug dealer something about his seriousness and tone made it seem almost like a prophecy and it stuck with me. 

Tldr: my drug dealing friend wanted to buy an onion, he meant drugs I thought he meant an actual onion.

EDIT: so to answer a few questions... 

My dad knew because of he grew up in the projects of LA he has MS now so he's not dealing or buying but he certainly did in his younger days.. According to him up until I was around 5 years old. 

Onion = ounce 

Apparently most people have either never heard it used in that context or use it for an ounce of weed, maybe he meant that idk.

He likes to do the regular stuff he’s used to but I want to switch it up sometimes. Sometimes he does but it’s like he’s not really into it so we just do the regular stuff. 

For a couples weeks now i’ve been setting up a threesome with me and my friend for him. She was down with it and she’s leaving this city so we won’t see her anymore and we could just forget about the whole thing (so i thought). 

Valentine’s day comes and he’s surprising me the whole day with flowers, gifts, food, clothes, yada yada. The last thing he had planned for us was dinner and it was amazing. We’re heading back home and i’m texting my friend making sure she set everything up and she’s ready for us to come in. 

We get home, go in and the room is set up so nice. Rose petals, Hennessy (I think that’s where i messed up) and tree. We played a drinking game and smoked and then we were getting into it. everything was good at first but then they started getting like TOO into each other. 

He’s flipping her over and doing tricks and putting his leg up and moaning and grunting while i’m getting the bare minimum. She’s over there moaning and going crazy acting like it’s the best dick she ever had in her life. the whole situation just made me uncomfortable so i ended up saying i was tired and we went to bed. 

I woke up this morning to cook for all of us and they were still just acting too friendly. laughing and touching and all that. she left a couple hours ago but he’s glued to that phone now. He won’t even let me see what he’s doing on it either. fuck my life. 

TL;dr: don’t have a threesome with your man he might just like the girl you brought more than you.

edit: I’m not mad about my boyfriend enjoying the threesome. I did it for him! I was just mad because he was ignoring me basically the whole threesome then was ignoring me and texting HER. I posted this on TIFU because I know this is on me. never asked for advice🤷🏽.

update: We talked about it and I just told him how i just didn’t expect the night to go like that, i got jealous, and I felt like he wasn’t showing me enough attention. He told me he just “got excited” because he knew it was a one time thing, hes sorry and maybe threesomes aren’t for us lmfao. I showed him that nobodies better than the original -*joseline voice*- and as far as the texting, he said he’s not texting her so i’m just going to trust him and forgot about that.

edit 2: IM BISEXUAL! I like girls and my boyfriend is the first man i ever dated. It was definitely supposed to be a threesome, not 2 straight girls and 1 straight guy. they just excluded me. tbh i think she’s not as gay as she says but that’s on me."

Fast forward yesterday, things don’t always as planned and in a nice civil way I got dumped right before Christmas. Yesterday was also a rough day at work so a pretty hard bad day overall. So I woke up this morning ready to start working from home due to COVID. Still little bummed about things ending but today must be better. 

Then the doorbell rang, ofcourse the gift has arrived. Bummed out and little sad I open the prank gift. From myself.

I’d let them take the car. 

Actual preface: this was a joke. We are a joking family. 

Backstory: our kids woke up super early so we made them breakfast, turned on the TV and went back to bed for a quick sleep in. 

Present story: 
Once they were bored with the TV they came in to our bed for cuddles and basic shit talking (as kids do. Omg can they shit talk)

After a few minutes I asked if everyone wanted McDonald’s and everyone agreed. 

I told my 7yo son that he would have to walk to the store (it’s roughly 500 meters away but you have to cross a busy road to get there) with his 4yo sister to get breakfast for everyone. 

While he was suspicious of this joke request he kept asking “dad? Do I really have to do that?”
And I would reply “yes, mate. We’re both tired. Could you go get us breakfast please?”

This went on for a few minutes and then I laughed and said “don’t worry mate. I’ll get it” then went and had a shower. 

While I was in the shower he had a complete anxiety attack about having to walk to McDonald’s and my wife said he was hysterical for at least 5 minutes. Like a full blown, inconsolable panic attack. 

He actually thought I wanted him and his sister to walk to McDonald’s to get breakfast. He’s such a sweet kid. 

TL;DR told my 7yo kid he had to walk to McDonald’s to get breakfast for the family, was joking but he has a complete anxiety attack about it and I feel like shit.

Edit: for those suggesting my actions were extremely terrible. when I say we are a joking family I mean that this kind of play happens all the time. 

Even my 7yo will pretend the TV is broken only to “prank” me. This was an unprecedented turn of events and he would have usually called me out on my BS. 

This is why it’s a TIFU and not an EVERYDAY I FUCK UP.

Edit 2: thank you for the hate mail and suggestions. Holy shit, some of you are redacted. Only some. Most of you are level headed, responsible people.

Edit 3: holy shit. Did not expect this to even make a ripple in the water. Which it hasn’t but in reddit standards, whoa!

For our age group (grade 7, so 12/13) we were running a ""pub quiz"" run by a PowerPoint presentation with the questions and answers .

I was in charge of making the PowerPoint and I was using the “insert image from online” option, which limits my options but I didn’t feel like having a bunch of random images on my hard drive. One of the questions in the “Disney” category was about Disney princesses. I used [this](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8206/8230704981_1b02ab35fc_z.jpg) image and didn’t notice anything wrong. I was using split-screen, one screen for the PowerPoint and the other for the questions so the image was small to me.  The first time I saw this picture in full size was during the activity with the children. I had a mild panic attack and I very quickly “accidentally” skipped to the answer. Afterwards I showed the other counsellors and we had a laugh about it.

My boyfriend and I were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. I took a shower, and I remember feeling really smug because I remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. For anyone that doesn’t know what it is, it’s literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

After using it, I wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when I had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. It’s important to note that I had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the ‘head’ of it.

Anyway, everything’s fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and I are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for “a word” with my boyfriend. We both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

After a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says “why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?”  Obviously I was perplexed, saying I REALLY had no idea what he was talking about. He was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as “pink with a big bulb” and then it hit me.

I too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as I explained what it was. Unfortunately, I didn’t realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

“You don’t have to lie BloatedRabbit, it’s ok but just next time don’t leave it around for everyone to see.”

“I swear on my life it’s a face cleanser!” I said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. I handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. My boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he’s a dirty old man for thinking like that. His dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when I think about it.

“Well I’m sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother’s toys!” 


I’m not religious at all, but when I say I wanted God to beam me up there and then... I’m not kidding. I felt like jumping out the window. The whole energy of the room shifted. His dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn’t dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

Worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. My boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. Talk about awkward.

TL;DR I left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend’s conservative parents bathroom. His dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend’s mum’s toys."
kndllv,TIFU by breathing COVID fumes,29495,0.91,1185,2020-12-31 05:00:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kndllv/tifu_by_breathing_covid_fumes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kndllv/tifu_by_breathing_covid_fumes/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I'm a doctor working in the ER and there are a lot of COVID patients every day. I know the routine of putting on all the protective gear, the masks, the treatment- this wasn't my first rodeo with COVID.

&#x200B;

The patient is older, and is currently hypoxic (not getting enough oxygen), and I am suspecting a super infection with bacterial pneumonia on top. At first the patient is on 3 liters of O2, but the nurse calls me in because she can't get an arterial blood sample and it needs to be done with ultrasound to find the artery. Get into all the gear, go in with scanner, get the sample, evaluate the person, increase oxygen, get out and confer with my attending, get all the COVID regiment going.

&#x200B;

The patient desaturates again- oxygen saturation needs to be above 95% in people with no lung diseases- above 92% can be acceptable in COVID cases. The patient is at 84%. On goes the gear, new arterial blood sample, increase oxygen, stabilize the patient.

&#x200B;

Rinse and repeat until I've been into the room six times to stabilize the patient, who is quickly getting worse. I know the protective gear, it's like a reflex to put it all on correctly by now.

&#x200B;

But the patient is still getting worse, so I put them on high flow oxygen treatment, 35 liters of flow and 35% oxygen levels. I talk to the ICU, because this patient is rapidly deteriorating and there is ONE spot free so I nab that like a greedy little gremlin.

&#x200B;

Just before the patient is getting transferred, the O2 levels drops again to 68% and the nurse calls me in a panic to tell me that the patient is crashing. I rush into the protective gear, get in there and crank the high flow to the max. Eventually I manage to stabilize the patient enough for transport and they go to the ICU- an hour later they're on a respirator.

&#x200B;

Yay me, right? The next day however, my attending pulls me over and asks me what sort of mask I was wearing when I went into the patients room on that 7th time and my heart just fucking plummets. I stutter out ""I was wearing the wrong mask.""

&#x200B;

On a high flow air treatment, you have to wear an FFP3 mask. I only wore a regular surgical mask because that was the only mask at the gear station.

&#x200B;

I think back on how I leaned over the patient to get the arterial blood sample with the ultrasound scanner. I remember how I held the patients hand, telling the patient we were doing everything we could and we were going to transfer to ICU. I remember the patient coughing, me standing right next to the bed, just breathing in the COVID fumes.

&#x200B;

All the times I've seen COVID patients, all the times I've put on the correct gear and this one time I managed to screw up. Currently at home in isolation, waiting for the COVID tests, while all my colleagues are working their butts off at the ER.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I am a dumb doctor at work, forgot to wear the right protective gear and got coughed in the face by a COVID patient. COVID sucks, wear your masks.

EDIT1:

Also worth noting, and because I've gotten a few messages about it- the standard PPE for covid or suspected covid cases is different from place to place, as are the procedures. Where I work the standard gear is a face shield, a surgical mask, gloves and a coat, which is only to be worn once.

If there is a risk of aerosols, such as high flow air treatment or cardiac arrest treatment, we are allowed to wear FFP2/FFP3 (N95 and N99) but they are also only for one time use. These sorts of masks will not be at the PPE stations unless there is a need for it.

EDIT2: Thank you all for your kind words and well-wishes! You are all wonderful people who make me feel a little better about the situation. I am waiting to get tested on the 4th and 7th day of exposure and hopefully they will come back negative so I can get back in the field. And then I will NEVER forget to put on the right gear again!

And to all my fellow healthcare workers; stay safe out there!

&#x200B;

Last edit here: I tested negative on my 4th and 7th day after exposure, so I am in the clear! And I waited an hour in line today to get my covid shot. Patient is still on a respirator, but is on the way to recovery and hopefully will pull through.

Thanks again for all your well wishes and wonderful words.

c62vbq,TIFU accidentally watching a Black Mirror Episode with Audio Description on,29479,0.86,1478,2019-06-27 13:43:27,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c62vbq/tifu_accidentally_watching_a_black_mirror_episode/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c62vbq/tifu_accidentally_watching_a_black_mirror_episode/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. 

Said episode was ""Shut up and Dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

Now, I don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""Sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

Had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

I think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

Well, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

We were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

Tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.





Edit: mostly lurker, I don't know if there are any etiquettes I have to follow through, I will upvote everyone's comments for now.

For those who says it's not TIFU, I guess it's mundane, that's true. Since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? Of fuck up, and so are mods,  I am at peace with it."

I had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

Now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say ""No pain, no game.""   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.

I removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

TLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.

guuh11,TIFU by telling my Aunt her bf cheated.,29458,0.9,1188,2020-06-02 03:51:39,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/guuh11/tifu_by_telling_my_aunt_her_bf_cheated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/guuh11/tifu_by_telling_my_aunt_her_bf_cheated/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happened a couple days ago, and all I wish was I done it sooner.

The story starts at my parents wedding. Cracking night etc, but the following morning I comfort my sister crying. She ends up telling me my Aunt's BF slept with our god-sister at the wedding night. 
My immediate response is, well gotta tell her, it's what I'd want if it was me. 
I go talk about it with my parents who know, and dad says it's not his business (he's a very ""too himself"" type of guy, don't want to get involved) but I plead with my mother saying it's her sister, it should come from her. She tells me not to and if I do ""I'll disown you and never talk to you in my life."". 

We then found out she was pregnant with his kid, another nail in telling her coffin.
So I keep my mouth shut.
This is my first fuck up, as I myself am very unconcerned about what others think, as long as I believe truly, I'm doing the right thing.

I vent about it to my SO and explain what my mum said etc, she understand but still think I should find a way to tell my aunt without it being pinned on me.
I thought about it to many a night.

Cutting to the chase, 7-8 months go by and still no one has said a thing, He(cheat) prances around like he owns the place, and My god-sister believes she's got away with it.
We had a small family BBQ to celebrate birthdays, (well within the social distancing rules in the UK)
All going fine until I overhear Cheat saying something on the phone, ""Yeah I'll see you later, stop calling me until I call you"" on phone with GS.
Something in me snapped and I asked if my aunt wanted to go shop with me.
As we are walking she could tell something was wrong. She kept pressing me to say, I told her it would ruin her life.. so I did, I told her, knowing how she would react, knowing it'll be me to get the blame for any fallout and me taking the brunt of hatred from everyone. But I did, and do believe it was the right thing to do.

And the fallout was crazy, she confronted him, he came at me, throwing me against a car, smashing a vase on my leg(3stitches(first time ever)) threatening my family, my mum not talking to me, just, hell let loose..fear of what my aunt would do if left alone.

As much as I regret not saying anything sooner. I'm glad I did tell her, because how much long would it have been before anyone did?

This is my first post here, probably won't be my last. Thank you.

TL;DR:. Told my aunt her BF was cheating on her after months of knowing, hell broke, needed stitches.

Edit: 

Firstly; God-sister is the term we used for her to describe her, it's because she's my god-mothers daughter, that's just the short cut to it, not a cult or such, apologies for confusion! It adds to the insult towards my aunt as she was basically like a sister to Me, and a niece to her too.

Secondly, I'm male 5'8"" while this guy was near on 7' and built like a brick shithouse. Not going to take a fight I know I'll lose (especially with cameras on me)

Thirdly, in terms of legal actions, I know I have some evidence(Injury, CCTV footage off of the neighbours etc) but my first thought is making sure my aunt and cousins are okay.

Forth, my aunt has since had the baby, I wasn't too sure how far along she was when I was told she was pregnant, believe end of 1st trimester.


To all saying it doesn't belong her etc, I hear you, but at the time of writing, I felt as if I had fucked up, with the treatment I got, I felt this was the appropriate place for it. 



I'll get back with an update on this thread when I know what's what, 

Thank you all for your concerns, opinions and the awards, even though some of your thoughts go against my actions, I still respect you for voicing them! 


Love to all"

This happened on Thanksgiving about 15 years ago when I was a young lad. My family always goes to my one Uncle's house, and they have a big basement with a light switch at the top of the stairs. Me (22m), my brother, my sister, and my 8 cousins always played a game which we called ""Monster in the bathroom"". The game is just hide and seek, but all the lights are out and the people have to make a noise when the seeker asks them to. Also, we never play it in an actual bathroom, no idea why we call it that.

So we play a few games, the lights start on so people can find a good place to hide while the seeker stands at the top of the stairs and counts down. When they are finished counting, they turn out the light and make their way down the stairs to find people. My oldest cousin was the seeker this game, and he's kinda known as the funny one of the bunch so I was presented an opportunity to out humor him.

As he was walking down the stairs, I suddenly got the urge to fart. I could tell this was a mammoth of a fart just by feel, so I was dying for him to ask for us to make a noise. Finally, as he got to the bottom of the stairs and screams loudly ""MAKE A NOISE!"" Trying to get a laugh out of everyone. Not to be outdone, I released the loudest and wettest fart I had ever released in my young life. Every single person hiding burst into hysterical laughter, including myself and the seeker.

After the laughing died down, I realized my FU. My legendary fart was actually a shart, and I had wet shit dripping down my leg. The other FU was that even though everyone else stopped laughing after 30 seconds, I couldn't stop. I laughed so hard that I also pissed my pants. My cousin immediately caught me, and it was revealed that I had simultaneously shit and pissed my pants. The game ended right there, because I had to go upstairs and borrow pants and underwear from my cousin.

Now, every single year when my family arrives to Thanksgiving, every cousin comes up to me and yells ""HEY MAX30070, MAKE A NOISE!"" This has not gotten old to them, and I will be arriving at my Uncle's house in about 2 hours. I will undoubtedly be asked to make a noise, as it is a Thanksgiving tradition from here till the day I die.

Tl;dr Played a game of hide and seek in the dark, was asked to make a noise, accidently shit and pissed myself, now I am reminded of it every Thanksgiving by cousins.

Edit: my cousins are currently trolling me by saying ""lol dude this happened last year"" so at the ripe age of 21 I shit and pissed myself guys. GG me I guess.

Edit 2: My sister just linked this to her Instagram story. Now everyone I know is gunna know this story lol

Edit 3: Thanks for reading and to everyone who enjoyed my story! My mom can't believe a story about me shitting myself became this popular lol. I posted this because I was sitting on my couch waiting for my family to get ready and thinking about how I was gunna get trolled when I got there. Then I thought it would make a funny TIFU story. Sorry to the people I haven't responded to, I got tipsy and lost track of everything. Happy Thanksgiving!"

I'm a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, ""Man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

I'm thinking to myself, ""What the fuck?"" So I'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I'm thinking, ""I've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don't need this shit"" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I've never trained for this.

This little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I'm trying to run backwards away from him. We've covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I'm thinking, ""How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I'm a grown ass man. This is bullshit.""

I try running again and he keeps flying after me. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don't want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?"" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

This was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

I cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

This is bullshit. I'm covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.

TL;DR I'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I'm covered in blood.

EDIT: A small amount of proof from the initial moment of not realizing what was happening: https://imgur.com/a/SxZ7Y

EDIT 2: ITT: People what don't understand the difference between can't fight a duck and *not wanting to fight a fucking duck.*

c1kkxs,TIFU by giving my 19 year old Puggle the fat off my t-bone steak,29439,0.93,904,2019-06-17 12:46:23,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c1kkxs/tifu_by_giving_my_19_year_old_puggle_the_fat_off/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c1kkxs/tifu_by_giving_my_19_year_old_puggle_the_fat_off/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause I'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, ""man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn't expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I'm watching him eat it cause I'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don't know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second & I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

TL;DR I brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

edit; wow, thank you for the silver, kind stranger ;-;

edit; this post blew up. thank you so much for all the love, very pleased to know so many enjoyed.

EDIT; everyone loves Buster so much, I've created an Instagram for him that I will be posting on regularly. link is in the comments cause idk if my p9st will get taken down if posted on main post. you wanted da cult? you got da cult. many more posts to come."
10xqn4a,TIFU telling my dad I (20m) have never had sex,29386,0.91,1231,2023-02-09 15:04:34,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10xqn4a/tifu_telling_my_dad_i_20m_have_never_had_sex/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/10xqn4a/tifu_telling_my_dad_i_20m_have_never_had_sex/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,False,False,"A few days ago I decided to visit my dad at his house. It was his birthday. I showed up with wine. We got a little drunk. Maybe more than a little. When my dad was done going on and on about how much he missed my mom since she divorced him, he changed the subject and focused on my love life. He asked if I had a gf and I said no. Then he asked if I've ever had a gf because he's never seen me with a girl. I said never. My dad poured the last drop of wine in my glass and asked if I was still a virgin. I was tempted to lie, but I paused too long, so I said yes. My dad said I had no reason to feel ashamed about my virginity, but encouraged me to have as much sex as possible before I end up married to a person whose vagina comes with an impenetrable encryption. I ignored the obvious reference to my mom's you-know-what and called it a night. 

I asked my dad if I was allowed to sleep in the spare bedroom because I didn't want to drive home drunk. My dad said I was more than welcome. I must have been sleeping for less than an hour before I woke up to the sound of my dad knocking on the door. I don't remember what I mumbled as I opened my eyes, but the moment my dad heard my voice, he entered my room with another person. It was a girl. My dad introduced her by name, but did the air quotes thing with his fingers to imply that it was a fake name. I could tell my dad was still drunk. Exhibit A, he continued making the air quote gesture, even when it was no longer neccessary. Not gonna lie, I was still drunk too, but not drunk enough to disregard the weird fucking shit that was happening. Without giving me proper time to react, my dad quickly said the girl knew exactly what to do before closing the door on his way out. 

The girl did not know what to do. She did nothing other than awkwardly waiting for me to say something. I eventually asked her what was going on and she said my dad hired her to sleep with me. I died of embarrassment, especially when the girl asked me to explain if I was on the zero experience or the some experience end of the virgin spectrum. Without thinking, I said I was gay. It was the first time I actually said it out loud. The girl sat down on the bed and asked if I was a top or a bottom. I shrugged and said I didn't know yet. My face must have been so red at that moment. The girl said if I was willing to go shower, then she would basically be willing to motorboat my butt. To be honest, I considered it. I'm human. I'm horny. However, the situation was way too weird for me to be completely comfortable doing something that sexual with someone I didn't know at all. 

I said thank you but no thank you to the girl and apologized for my dad putting both of us in an awkward position. She said she understood and for some reason thought it was neccessary to mention that my dad was one of their regular customers. She made it clear for the record that she never had sex with my dad, but explained that some of her older coworkers at the escort service really enjoyed spending time with him. She said she can't wait to tell the other sex workers that she met me because apparently my dad loves to talk about his son with the people he pays to fuck. I was not psychologically prepared for the unexpected discussion regarding my dad's sex life. The girl had a severe case of motormouth. When she finally stopped talking, I learned that my dad sleeps with sex workers who kind of look like my mom and that women closing their eyes with too much food in their mouth and saying ""hmmmmmm"" turns him on. 

The girl apologized for abusing my ""good listening skills"" and asked if there was nothing she could do for me. I said she could keep my sexuality between the two of us. She said her lips were sealed until the time comes to suck cock. My dad was passed out in the living room when we approached the front door. I went back to bed when the girl was gone and eventually fell asleep. The following morning I confronted my dad. I said I didn't appreciate what he did and made sure he understood that he wasted his money because nothing happened. My dad was apologetic and promised never to cross that line again, no matter how much alcohol is involved. Despite his apology, the mood was still somewhat tense. I decided to break the tension by closing my eyes and saying hmmmmmm while eating breakfast. 

The look on my dad's face was priceless. I lost my appetite soon afterwards because I instantly regretted doing something that might arouse my father. 

TL:DR Told my dad I was still a virgin and his response was to blindside me in the middle of the night with a sex worker who realized I was not into girls and ended up telling me more than I wanted to know about my dad's history with other sex workers."
p3khn2,TIFU by playing god with the delicate balance of nature...,29378,0.91,1636,2021-08-13 15:39:41,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p3khn2/tifu_by_playing_god_with_the_delicate_balance_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/p3khn2/tifu_by_playing_god_with_the_delicate_balance_of/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,,False,"I accidentally started a large-scale war between ants, and I feel absolutely terrible...

So, I own two large ant farms and have for many months, both of which contain harvester ants. The smallest farm had become damaged, thanks to my clumsy niece, so I wanted to relocate the ants somewhere safer.

Last night, I came up with the bright idea to connect the two enclosures with a piece of plastic tubing I had laying around, hoping they'd maybe move in together. I know that's stupid now, but it felt like a good idea at the time... 

Sure enough, after an hour, the ants from enclosure two started venturing through the tube, excited to explore their newly expanded world. Suddenly, though, to my surprise, the ants from enclosure one ran into their little hill, seemingly going into hiding.

Around twenty minutes later, some of the large soldier ants from enclosure two began to poke around inside the hole to the hill of enclosure one. Chaos, and I mean utter fucking chaos ensued... The ants from enclosure one began pouring out into the sand. I didn't even know there were so many in there. Within seconds, they were fighting, the soldiers from enclosure two tearing them in half like fucking maniacs.

At this point, I really wanted to intervene, desperate to stop the brutal madness, but it was too late. With almost all of the solider ants from enclosure one laying bloodied and decimated, one of the soldiers from enclosure two made a move for the hill's sandy entrance. This girl was absolutely huge, almost a third as big as the Queen. Noticing the attempted attack, the surviving worker ants from enclosure one moved in on her position from the surrounding sand. They piled on her, literally covering her entire body, biting into her with vicious fury. Yet, she kept moving, entering the small hole like a damned tank.

At this point in the war, I didn't have a clear view of the battle which was taking place within the hill. I tired to rotate the connected enclosures, but, alas, the siege was taking place in a sandy part of the hill.

After around ten minutes, I see the soldier ant from enclosure two's ass, backing out of the hole, one of her back-left legs missing. To my absolute fucking horror, she begins to drag the queen out of the hole by her head. All the while, she's biting down into the soldier's seemingly impenetrable skull with everything she has, her workers still climbing all over this absolute monster.

After a good minute of tugging on enclosure one's Queen, thrashing from side to side, her insides being bitten into, the soldier just jerks the hell backward. In this single, decisive tug, she tears the Queen's head right the hell off. She then turns, examines the corpses of her fallen sisters, who've died in the meantime, and she simply begins to walk away, the Queen's decapitated head held within her mandibles, a trophy of war.

As of now, enclosure one has no Queen, and only twelve workers remain, from what I can see anyway. The solider, believe it or not, is still very much alive. She's returned home to enclosure two, with the Queen's head in tow. She's resting inside the hill, beside her own Queen, preparing for possible retaliation.

I've disconnected the two enclosures, but I honestly don't know what to do now... It's the most brutal thing I've ever witnessed, and I feel like I've just fucked up an entire world with nothing more than a bit of plastic tubing...

Tl;DR - I decimated an entire colony of ants by allowing another colony to behead their queen...

I'll try and add pics when I get home from work.

UPDATE!

Alrighty. Here's a pic of enclosure one's battlefield, and the many bodies, some of which have recieved a soldier's burial (many of the black spots further toward the hill). I've also added a pic of Kratos, the ant Slayer, but she's currently in hiding, and a little tricky to see, you know, with the mass genocide and all... Her lil murderous ass is circled, next to her Queen.

Sorry the pics aren't terribly dramatic lol. My phone's camera sucks. 

Also, I was being coy in some of my comments with regards to my writing, as I'm always deeply nervous about sharing stuff with the outside world, but I'm actually an author of horror, thrillers, and weird fiction. With that said, I don't know if I'm allowed to share my links here, but my pen name on Amazon is Jennah Walters. So, if you want to check that out, it's up to you. 

Screw it. If Kratos can slaughter an entire race, I can sneak in a link and toot my own horn.

Thank you all so much for the kind words, premium, and awards. I hope you have an amazing day. I'm sorry I can't reply to all your comments. There's just too many, and the constant phone vibration is making my coworkers think I'm smuggling a sex toy. 

I didn't expect this post to blow the hell up like it did lol. I'll make sure to keep caring for my ants as best I can, while maintaining a healthy level of fear toward the one they call Kratos!

Finally, I just wanted to say that you've all made my day. I expected to maybe entertain a few people with this story of events, but, damn... Also, yes, I know Kratos is a female. ♥

UPDATE! Many of you kept asking for a short story retelling of these events, so I went ahead and did just that. You'll find the dramatic short story/flash fiction of Kratos, the ant slayer, below.

Tl;Dr~ So I wake up at 2 am, way too early for work, Fiancée is asleep at the time, so I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to massage my snake outside, where we have cameras I forgot about. 

>So; 

It’s 2, I wake up too early, I’m in a bad way, I have spring fever like a Stallion in a field of a thousand Phillies, I’m looking at the light fixtures dreaming of titties, I roll over on my side and the friction of the sheet makes my balls ache like I’m getting a handy from Mike Tyson. I live on my ranch, so it’s really quiet, and I’m listening to the howl of the wind and the idea of absolutely shwacking my beef tube in the morning air is... intoxicating, and I’m not even into that.

I must note, I’ve also been showering with the hose outside, like, my fiancée will step out into the yard and hose me off while I take a refreshing shower and, Idk, get attuned with the earth or whatever the fuck, so I never really considered the cameras I recently installed in the yard because, who gives a shit? No one thinks before they nut

Anyway, I try to wake up my fiancée, she just moans and groans, ignoring me, suddenly the sweet sounds of ringing wind chimes has me thinking about the outdoors again. I have four bedrooms in this old ass house, but I decide my balls and shmeat need that mountain breeze, so I, already naked, stomp my ass outside, sit on my bench, spend ten minutes looking for something halfway depraved on my phone, I find a solid video, and I crank my fucking Soj like a 1993 Chevy with a factory starter. Only thing is, the cold breeze is giving my asshole the chills, and my body starts shivering, but I’m angry fapping at this point, determined to at least get climax adjacent.

So, I’m slapping my sack, biting my lip and being a degenerate when the sweet sound of my loves voice asks from the WiFi camera: Having fun? 

I shame nutted, the heart drop literally made me ink like a squid. 

How Could I forget?!?

She took a screenshot of my nighttime grainy ass “O” face and has been mocking me for at least an hour straight."

Just to preface, my husband (24M) and I (25F) are very comfortable with each other. Especially when it comes to normal body functions such as pooping, burping, and farting. 

Anyway, one day about six months ago, I thought I was being really cute rocking the ""winnie the pooh"" (shirt w/ no bottoms.)  It started with a casual conversation while my husband was sitting on the toilet. I was standing outside of the bathroom, while the door was open, and we're just chatting. I look at him straight in the eye, trying to be cute, and I went for a ""toot.""

Guys. This was not a fucking toot that came out of me. I looked my husband dead in the eye, thinking that I was cute and silly, THEN SHIT ON THE FUCKING FLOOR. Yup. Literally sharted. And because I was rocking the T-Shirt with no pants look, it had no where to go, but the floor. I was DEVASTATED. I thought I might be looking at divorce. I've never felt so humiliated. 

Husband here: At the moment of release I was looking her dead in the eye. I was expecting to hear a gnarly ass fart... all I heard was a wet plop/thud noise. It took my brain a second to process it, but as soon as I did I found myself looking at my wife in sheer/horror disbelief. The love of my life just shit on the floor like a filthy fucking animal. She turned bright red and slammed the door. I just sat on the toilet in disbelief.

TL;DR I tried to he cute and toot with no pants on, and I shit on the floor while looking my husband dead in the eye."

So this story starts a ways back when I set up my Google account. I rarely use my real name online, and most of the time I enjoy using immature names like 'Berry McCockinner' or 'Howie Fildersnatch'. I decided to go with 'Dixie Normus', and never thought twice about it. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, my wife says I should start using the chick file a app since I eat there so often. So I sign up, and use my Google account to log in. Easy. 

So over the last few weeks I cruise through the drive thru and scan my app and start accumulating points. Cool I guess. Never had an issue.

Today I went in for lunch and the line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, so I said fuck this imma go in and eat.

The line inside is long to 6, so I utilize the order online feature, and wait. 

That poor woman didn't even realize when she went to call my name. I wasn't expecting it. I forgot all about signing up with my Google account. 

""DIXIE NORMUS""

I felt worse for her than I did myself, the whole room stared at her, and I saw her show the receipt to co workers. I reluctantly walked up and grabbed my order, and walked out. 

Like I said, I know it's not the biggest fuck up, but I'm still laughing about it so I thought I'd share. 

TL;DR I signed into my app through my Google account without remembering that I used Dixie Normus as my name, and the cashier at a crowded fast food restaurant called it out LOUD."

My fuck up is far too extreme to put on my main account, and you’ll learn why quickly. 

This happened about 30 minutes ago. I am currently sitting in the hospital, alone, feeling defeated. I have done this to myself. 

So I’ll start with some backstory. I’m a closeted gay 18 year old boy living with his parents. I’m in high school, but just got off for Christmas break. About a month ago, I was scrolling through Wish (that shopping app where everything is insanely cheap) to see if I could find any funny gifts to get my family for Christmas. Though, lots and lots of sex toys kept popping up. I had never purchased one and since they were so cheap, I figured “Why the hell not?”.  It was a small dildo. 

It took about 3 weeks to arrive, which was actually earlier than expected. I wasn’t surprised, since most of my past orders from Wish came sporadically. I opened it up and it reeked of a chemical odor. I expected there to be some smell, assuming that it was made out of silicon, but damn did it smell awful. I took a shower that day and decided to clean it thoroughly while I was in there. The smell never completely went away, but it got less pungent. 

When I got back to my room, I started searching for a good place to hide it. My room has endless nooks and crannies to hide things in, so it wasn’t really an issue. I placed it in a shoebox in the corner of my closet and left it there. 

Fast forward to today. I had completely forgotten about the dildo because school had me constantly busy and worried about a million different things at all times.  But now it was Saturday, christmas break, and a ton of free time on my hands. I was laying in bed on my phone and randomly remembered about it, so I decided I would finally use it tonight. 

The night rolls around, and both my parents went to sleep. Perfect. I went in my closet, pulled out the dildo, and pulled up some porn on my computer. It was all going well for about 30 minutes, until I felt an itch coming from inside my butthole. I pulled it out, looked at it, and there were ANTS crawling out of the dildo’s pee hole. The makers of the dildo thought it would be a good idea to put an actual hole in the dildo for some godforsaken reason. I didn’t know how to react, so I just sat there, staring at it for a good 30 seconds. After my brain processed what the fuck had just happened, I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet. I tried to push, but nothing felt like it was coming out. I kept trying for a couple minutes, but still nothing. So I finally stood up, bent down to flush the toilet, and saw AT LEAST 50 ants just chilling in the water. I. Was. Mortified. 

I could still feel that itch in my butt, so I decided I needed to go to the hospital. I didn’t want any ants crawling up my god damn rectum. I wasn’t about to tell my parents what happened, so in my frantic state I just left.  Got in my car, and went to the hospital. 

So here we are. I can definitely say telling the doctor what happened is the most embarrassing thing I have ever had to do. I’m writing this here because I need to tell someone what happened. My parents are at home, sound asleep, probably dreaming about me leaving for college. I don’t know what I’ll do when they wake up, I don’t know how long I’ll be here, I don’t really know what the hell happens after this. 

Fuck me.

TL;DR: Used a cheap Chinese dildo. Put it in my closet, ants invaded it like suburban moms invading the hand sanitizers at Bath & Body Works. Used it, ants up the ass. Chilling at hospital.

b1o3uc,TIFU by not reading a Tinder Bio,29227,0.86,2929,2019-03-16 09:08:45,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b1o3uc/tifu_by_not_reading_a_tinder_bio/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b1o3uc/tifu_by_not_reading_a_tinder_bio/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"Alright, so this happened ""yesterday"" so its technically  YIFU. But whatever. 

So, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. Lets call her Lizzie. Anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. This was the fuckup. 

Lizzie and i match and get to talking. She is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and Very,Very cute. I'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.

Couple days later we go on the date. Now, I've been catfished before, so I'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. Nope. She shows up looking fantastic. (Just like in the simulations!) We get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. 

 After a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. Things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. Awesome.  She took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (BIG TITTY GOTH GF REEEE) Anyways I'm not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. (*tips fedora*) So i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. The next few moments were something like this:

""Uhh... whatcha got there..?""

""Oh my god i thought you knew""

*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*

""..nope. I had no clue""

Soooooo, she had a dick. Turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. Pre op.  Been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. While im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. I didn't freak out or anything. I assured her its fine, y'know shit happens. We ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. Ended up friends after all was said and done. 

Always. Read. Bios.

TLDR: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. Took off her skirt, saw a dick.

EDIT: This is my first ever post on reddit. Cant believe its made so many people laugh. Glad more people got something out of my potentially awkward situation!

EDIT: A lot of people asked if i would consider dating her post op. Yeah. Why not? I felt like we hit it off. 

 UPDATE: she replied. Verified this is ""Lizzie""

b1x57x,TIFU by forgetting I pranked my friend and accidentally giving him mild depression,29221,0.9,834,2019-03-17 02:18:26,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b1x57x/tifu_by_forgetting_i_pranked_my_friend_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b1x57x/tifu_by_forgetting_i_pranked_my_friend_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...

Back when I was at Uni my best friend (James) and I used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's Facebooks/social media. Think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.

One day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and James goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). I take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - I was going to change his post settings on facebook to ""only me"" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). Plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.

However, I only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to ""only me"") before he came back into the room, and I had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.

Now, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and I COMPLETELY forgot about this prank. Fast forward to almost a year later...

My friend is still at Uni (doing a masters degree) while I have moved to another city and started working. I should add that James is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. He messages me one day asking what I thought of his latest video on facebook. I went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...

I call him and tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, I posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. I'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \*clicks\* and I am immediately MORTIFIED - This entire time, I had left the ""only me"" setting on, and he hadn't realised. I hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.

For the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. He had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... One thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - ""I often layed awake at night thinking about this"". I don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.

Luckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. Bought him a lot of drinks next time I saw him though.

TL;DR  Forgot I changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.

Edit: Grammar

Edit 2: I should add that I was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when I think about it. He understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. The ""reveal"" itself was over 6 months ago, I was reminded earlier today when I saw an obvious ""stupid facebook prank"". We still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)

Edit 3: Just to clarify, he wasn't just starting to play guitar. He has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. During his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. His videos now get several likes and complimentary comments

Edit 4: So a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. After watching this blow up, I called my friend and linked him the reddit. He is amazed and wants everyone to know he's fine. He isn't keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said I could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. Here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: [https://youtu.be/eH\_m88IUoVk](https://youtu.be/eH_m88IUoVk).

Edit 5: Final video, a much newer cover he did for his girlfriend: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI)"

I work in the IT field, and have always been handy with computers.
Growing up, when I lived in my parents house, I did computer repair here and there, and often had many computer parts and accessories with me.
When I left my parents house, I ended up leaving a few things behind in my room.

My brother was still living with my parents at the time, and he has been known to dabble in illegal activities. So my mom is already on the paranoid side of things.

Fast forward about 2 years, and I get a frantic (frantic) call from my mom.

""I found a syringe in your room, and I think it's for drugs, but youre brother keeps lying to me and says it's yours! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?!?""

I ask some leading questions, and ask her what my brother said it was.

""He's saying it's for a computer, but I know better!""

Ok, is any writing on it? Does it have a needle?

""There's no needle, and there is a company name on the side""

Ok, well whats the company name? and did you google it?

""It says thermaltek on the side. And when I went to google it, all it came up with was computer parts! I know you don't use syringes for computers!!!""

Ok, so let's walk through this together ok?

1. You found said syringe and he said it was for a computer, and it was mine
2. You googled the company name and all you found were computer parts
3. you found it in my room
4. you know I work on computers
5. and there was no needles

It's thermal paste mom. It's used to apply a thin layer of paste for heat dispersion on the processor and graphics card. You're screaming at him over thermal paste. If it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it swims like a duck.... Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe he was telling the truth?

""Oh"" *click*

I give my brother a call to let him know what I just told my mom, and so he can never let her live it down.

tl;dr I forgot thermal paste in my room before I moved out, and my mom found it and instantly assumed my brother was shooting up heroin, and almost kicked him out, then wouldnt believe him after literally every piece of evidence was telling her otherwise."

Didn’t think anything of it but I get a call about an hour later from my wife. She’s laughing so hard she can hardly tell me what happened. 
My son got the text but was so sleepy he didn’t even think about what the noise was. He assumed it was his alarm and got up to get ready. Well he wakes the other three and tells them it’s time to go. So he showers and gets ready. They all get up, get dressed and get their luggage ready. 
He goes to get my wife and doesn’t know why she’s still in bed. She’s always the first up. 
Then he looks at the clock and it’s like 2am. Then he sees my text and realizes it wasn’t his alarm. 

I guess I’m lucky he’s so responsible.

I met a young guy a few years younger than me let's call him Dave, in my class who I spent most of the first week with.

It was our first ever criminology class and it was a new lecturer a woman in her mid 20s and the lesson was in a auditorium of nearly 100 people. She began by explaining the difference between manslaughter and murder and begin to tell us of a real case example.

The lecturer who ended up quite red in the face explained about a couple engaging in some form of roleplay and eventually ended with him fisting his partner. A signet ring he was wearing caught inside her and she unfortunately ended up bleeding to death.

Now comes the fuck up, obviously after this story there was a very awkward silence. Dave thought this break in noise was the perfect time to ask me a pertaining question in his innocence. 'I get why that would be considered manslaughter but why does she keep saying fisting instead of punching?'

The question was so hilariously innocent at the worst ever time. I'm now sitting cry-laughing unbelievably loudly after this absolute horrible story. It was 100 times funnier like a joke at a funeral because I knew how surreal it must be for everyone else in attendance of me laughing so hard I can barely breathe.

TL;DR: Woman that died from being fisted caused me to cry-laugh in front of 100 people because my friend thought that fisting was synonymous with punching and asked a question about it at the worst possible time."

My wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

Just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

Cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife's sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda"" I babbled 
I start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. 
Luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
They all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

My wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

TL:DR smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still"
dc682c,TIFU by letting my girlfriend touch my element and mineral collection,29137,0.92,1685,2019-10-02 11:34:57,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dc682c/tifu_by_letting_my_girlfriend_touch_my_element/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dc682c/tifu_by_letting_my_girlfriend_touch_my_element/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.

Well I do, it’s not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. It sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this
https://imgur.com/a/DRj8sjr

So the fuck up begins when I order the element Cobalt. It has to ship from Italy where I get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.
I emailed them, and they responded [in a very wholesome and google translated email](https://i.imgur.com/V5vODvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. 

So the jar arrives and I transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it’s designated jar. Everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. My girlfriend is at my house at the time, and I hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.

 I assume she’s looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  I think nothing of it. Later on her hand gets really red and itchy. Like reeallly bad. It looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.
She’s in a lot of irritation and some pain and I think I know the cause.

“Did you take the cobalt out of its jar”

“Yea I held it and looked at it”

I know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.
For those of you who don’t know, cobalt has an effect called “contact dermatitis” which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. Once you have one reaction, you’ll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. Cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. 

So now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. There wasn’t much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.
I had to deal with the fact that I handed her a very toxic metal and didn’t tell her. Yay for me. Major fuck up and I’m an idiot. 

TL;DR I handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. Oh and the metal also causes cancer.

*Edit:* Ok also I want to to throw this in there, that this probably won’t be that much of a problem. She doesn’t want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? Yea, zero. It would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. She wasn’t mad about it either, we laugh about it.

Edit 2: I need to be more specific about the allergy. Everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. We are all allergic. But after your first serious exposure, you’re significantly more sensitive to it. I didn’t really _give_ her an allergy, I just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. Also, don’t blame her. This is my fault and I should have been more clear. She is a smart person and it’s not her fault. This is TIFU not “Today someone else fucked up”

Edit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. I created a sub, r/CollectingElements to start you people up. In case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_

Girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that I'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random McDonald's. When I ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from Facebook. Because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).




Now normally I don't accept propositions like this because I'm thinking ""what's the catch?"" Well, I decide to live a little on the YOLO side...and since it's right next to a Subway Sandwich shop I think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, I give him a big hug because I know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. Apparently that was NOT the worst thing that could happen.




I show up. She shows up. She's real. I'm surprised. I buy her coffee because I subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. She uses her McCafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. Its cute. While the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. I go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because I'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. No girl. I text her the typical guy message ""lol u get lost???"". No response. Turns out she took the coffee and left.




So I'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. It's totally your decision. But I don't think that's the case...I think this girl is a serial McCafe dater. And I don't think this was her first time. It was too professional. Too clean. It was the perfect McHeist. And I'm starting to think I'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. Just a few euros.




And my heart.

dhlh42,TIFU by broadcasting porn to my son's room.,29104,0.86,1840,2019-10-14 09:51:08,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dhlh42/tifu_by_broadcasting_porn_to_my_sons_room/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dhlh42/tifu_by_broadcasting_porn_to_my_sons_room/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"This happened to me 30 minutes ago and I didn't know what to do some I am going to chronicle it here.

It all started with my son asking if I could use AirPlay to stream some League of Legends games to his T.V. since Worlds are going on. I was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however I figured what the hell I do things like that all the time so I should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. He tells me what games he wants to watch and I set up the connection and explain to him that I would let him stay up until 12, however he isn't to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.

My wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are ""loud and obnoxious"". At the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son's room, with the door locked while she is working. I was watching some Carnival Row and I said to myself ""self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. I pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. After a few minutes of searching I found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while I gathered the appropriate tools for the job. I press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. I jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. That is when I realized it. I am panicking, FUCK FUCK FUCK, across my screen it has airplay and my son's T.V. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and I thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so I change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.

That is when I hear it. My wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and I hear my son pleading with her and I here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). She is on a war-path now. uh oh. I start panicking ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. Then things go silent and I know she is coming for me I hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend I went to sleep. She kicks the door open, and I pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. She screams my name. My mind went blank and I made a snoring sound. That was probably the real fuck up. I heard her say, ""oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok."" I decided I needed to answer her or I am a dead man. I rolled over and said ....yea? At this point I am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. She precedes to chew me a new one. To paraphrase something like ""here I am working then I hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch"". She storms off and I heard her office door slam. I gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son's door is shut and I don't want to press my luck as I walk by. I head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to TIFU and here I am. Hopefully she doesn't smother me in my sleep lol.

Thanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. WoW and platinum, thanks a lot. :D

Edit/update 1: WoW, woke up and this post really blew up. Wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. She wasn't upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his T.V. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. Which escalated when she found out that I told him he could stay up until 12 and I, in fact, was the one who did the Porn streaming. Which escalated when she opened the door and I was pretending to be asleep. One thing I wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. We have all been there at some point. We don't have an abusive relationship. She is the authoritarian in the house and I am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.

Update 2: Talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can't wait to tell his friends. When I told him I can't believe he threw me under the bus he told me I would do the same and he is right.

Update 3: Sorry I have no intention of linking the ""sauce"" some mysteries are better left unsolved.

TL:DR I was using Airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son's room while my wife was right across the hall from him."
hbwaj6,TIFU by opening a 2 year old thermos,29094,0.93,1109,2020-06-19 12:55:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hbwaj6/tifu_by_opening_a_2_year_old_thermos/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/hbwaj6/tifu_by_opening_a_2_year_old_thermos/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So, a couple years ago my little Sister got a new backpack, and instead of cleaning out the old one and throwing it away, she shoved it in the coat closet. Today, I had the lovely priviledge of finding it and cleaning it out

The first outstanding thing I found was a home packed lunch that had been left to rot in a closet for 2 years. From the looks of it, my sister had not touched the food, so it was all there, gathering immense amounts of mold and turning to mush.

After throwing away 3 or 4 bags of unidentifiable fruits and vegetables, I came across the thermos. Why I didnt follow my gut instinct to throw this thing out is beyond me at this point, but I made an attempt to open it. I tried to unscrew the cap, with absolutely no success. Trying a little harder, again I went to unscrew it. At this point the bottle was taunting me, it had waged a war that it already knew it had won. I was pulling out every trick imaginable, running it under hot water, using a towel for better grip, tapping it against a hard surface, but the capsule remained vigilant.

I finally admitted defeat and turned to get reinforcements, but this is the exact moment that it had been waiting for. After I got about 10 feet from the sink, I heard an explosion. A wave of pure nauseating, vile putridness hit my nose before I even heard the cap hit the floor! The microbes had been preparing for this moment for two years, and I unsuspectingly activated their trap card. My eyes were watering and I was futally attempting to suppress the gagging that ensued. I have smelt many awful things in my life, skunk, weed, rotting human feces, but none have left NEARLY as deep of a scar as what I have experienced today. The only way I can describe the smell is pure danger. My nose was screaming biohazard.

I ran back to the sink to finish what I had started and dumped probably and inch or two of soap on the mac and cheese that was left rotting twice through the summer, fall, winter and spring in a pathetic attempt to mask the smell. I dumped the vile blob down the irrigator, praying that I would live. I could feel the life force draining from me as the smell continued to permeate my nose.

I retreated from the house for a couple hours, begging that the smell had left, but the faint smell of rotten dairy still lurked in the house. I dont know how long exactly it took, but it eventually dissipated and I've been left only with the scar of my stupidity.

TLDR: I opened a thermos filled with rotting mac and cheese, only to be assaulted by the worst smell I have ever experienced.

EDIT: To those questioning my use of weed as a bad smell, it smells awful to me. I get that some people might really enjoy it, but to me you might as well hold a skunk up to my nose.

EDIT 2: its come to my attention that there is a difference between the smell of buds and the smell of smoke. For clarification, when I say weed, I am referring to the smoke."

He had no reason to head to the stairs. He comes back down and I see him rummaging through what I thought was his backpack. Turns out he completely unpacked my entire suitcase looking for underwear. My stupid ass finally realizes he's sleepwalking and I wake him up gently. I ask him what he is doing and he said ""I went to the bathroom"". It's at this point I start panicking and ask where he went to the bathroom. He realizes too and says ""I don't know"". So here it is 4am. I have scanned my grandparents entire house and can't find the urine. But I know it's there. And I lie here, waiting to hear the scream from someone finding it with their foot, having to come clean, and become disinvited from future family gatherings. 

Tldr; husband peed somewhere in my grandparents house and I can't find it"

So I wake up on a fine Sunday morning and my lovely wife snuggles into me for a cuddle. We're comfortable enough with each other that farting is not really an issue so I let one rip.

This was quite possibly the best fart I've ever done. I swear the covers lifted a fraction from the sheer force.

My wife looks up with a mix of admiration and disgust at the stupid grin on my face and inspiration strikes. I quickly grab the blanket and pull it over her head. Brilliant! Or so I thought.

Acting far quicker than I ever thought possible she manages to kidney punch me, escape from the blankets, drag them up over my head and drop the dirtiest fart I've ever smelt right in my face.

As a little extra flavour, my wife is lactose intolerant, and also in denial about her lactose intolerance. The phrase 'a little bit won't hurt' is her life motto. Often followed by horrible bloating and gas.

The previous night she had eaten a bunch of pizza and chocolate. I couldn't breathe.

To add insult to injury she then called in my two little devilspawn daughters and told them to jump on me, causing me to gasp as two seperate impacts rocked me under the bed.

Needless to say I won't be trying that stunt again for a while.

Tl;dr: tried to Dutch oven my wife and she won.

Edit: holy crap this blew up. Thanks for all the love guys. Yes, I know that my wife is amazing and I have no idea how she's put up with me for 8 years of marriage.

Edit again: A lot of people have asked so I did a bit of research. Apparently the term comes from the 17th century when the British and the Dutch fought a bunch of wars and the British started coming up with slang and insults for the Dutch. That's where stuff like 'double Dutch' comes from too. It's derived from the Dutch oven crockpot that keeps all the smells and heat in."

I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.

Also, they removed my post but anyway; 

One of my wife’s friends has cancer. She’s been undergoing chemotherapy and as a result has lost all of her hair. Yesterday my wife was with her and one other friend. They decided that they’d shave off all their hair to support their friend and cheer her up. And they did. It’s a great gesture and all, but I wasn’t aware of this. 

I was working on my laptop on the bed when my wife comes up and asks me if I find bald women attractive. I wasn’t looking at her and hadn’t seen that *she* was bald, so I say, ‘Nope. Not my type. Not attracted at all. Why?’ Then I look up and, lo and behold, my wife was bald. Not a single hair on her head. I was so shocked my face could’ve probably become a viral meme. 

She says that I don’t find her attractive now and starts crying. I try to salvage the situation by telling her that I don’t find *other* bald women attractive, but she looked hot without hair. She told me I was lying. I tell her that it’s just hair and will grow back. This was apparently not a good thing to say as she started crying again. 

My mom, who’s been living with us, told me I’m an ass for making her cry. Wife slept in a different room. She’s been also looking in the mirror quite often. I’ve tried telling her that I don’t care about the hair and she did a great thing supporting her friend but she says that I’ve given her a small insecurity issue for the time being. 

TL;DR wife asks me if I find bald women attractive, I say no without looking. When I look up, wife was bald.

Edit : Wow this blew up. Since some of y’all are asking, she’s not generally this emotional. Just that her friend probably won’t survive the cancer and has limited time. That’s been messing up with her state of mind lately.

Edit 2: Everyone wants me to shave my head. Not happening. Nope. I quite like my head full of hair. What if it never grows back lmao?"

So this evening was much like any other (well, any other quarantine evening). I wrapped work at home, my girlfriend & I walked the dog around the park, and then went back to the apartment to relax before dinner. We were missing a few key dinner items (beer) so I ran to the store to pick them up. When I got back home and walked through the door, my girlfriend (who is the best) had dressed up in full sexy teacher regalia (see) - skirt, glasses and all. Fuck. Yes.

As things were just about to get started, my phone rang. I wasn't about to interrupt what was going down so I naturally ignored the call. Ah, but then the text tone. And then my girlfriend's text tone. We checked and it turned out it was a good friend dropping off food gifts but couldn't get into the apartment building. I hated to pause but it was super sweet of her so, as the one not in costume, I ran down. My flaw here (and don't judge me guys) is that me and this friend started to catch up a little bit and suddenly 20 minutes had gone by. Damnit. I hurried myself back to the apartment but when I walked in she was no longer on the couch - she was dicing jalapenos, finishing making guacamole in the kitchen, still in costume. I loved it, don't get me wrong, but also had other intentions. I think the more astute of you might know where this is going...

We wound up getting hot and heavy in the kitchen and moved to the bedroom. We started with hand play, she went down on me, then I went down on her. All was right with the world. And then I started to feel an uncomfortable tingle on my nethers, a strengthening tingle, god-like, especially on my huevos. And all of a sudden I'm on fire.

I didn't want to kill the mood. I really didn't. I tried to power through for another 30 seconds, but eventually it occurred to me that a.) this wasn't going away and b.) when we did get to where we were going, she was going to catch the pain too. I paused and looked up:

""Babe...did you wash your hands after you cut up those jalapenos?"" ""Yeah...why?..oh..."" ""Babe, I..."" and suddenly I just started laughing as the heat continued to grow. ""I gotta go!""

I ran straight to the bathroom and started to wash things off. She ran in after me, apologizing the whole way. As I stood balls-to-sink, she rummaged through her bathroom cabinet looking for remedies.

""Aloe, aloe"" ""I know, I know""

Finally she pulled out an old bottle with ""ALOE"" in giant letters across it. Sweet baby Jesus, yes. I palmed up and slapped it on. As I waited for relief to wash over, I felt something else entirely. An even stronger burn. We look at the bottle and notice the subtext under ""ALOE""...it says ""with lidocaine"". Between the jalapeno and the lidocaine, my balls were somewhere between the 4th of July and the Chinese New Year.

After much rinsing, laughter, and a few tears, I am now on the couch with an ice pack on my balls watching Netflix. I feel mostly back to normal but it has been quite the ride. In another hour or so, I might even be fully functional again. Who knows?

Happy Thursday everyone!

tl;dr - girlfriend cooked in a kink, brought my balls to the brink, and I wound up washing twice in the bathroom sink.



UPDATE - Well this has been a fun surprise! Many thanks to all for the comments and involvement. We read many of them in morning before work, laughing our asses off the whole time. A few updates. 1.) I am completely back to normal after my brush with the fires of the underworld 2.) I am now much more educated on what lidocaine is thanks to you trusty folks! I checked the back of the bottle and I now highly suspect it was the spearmint leaf oil that doubled my fun. 3.)  We have decided that in the future we will place a ceremonial bowl of milk next to the bed on Mexican food nights for pre- and post- dips, just to be safe. Thanks everyone and happy Friday!"

Yesterday was my (f25) husband’s (m26) birthday and I decided to give him an early birthday present by waking him up with a blowjob. Well, he sure as hell woke up when he instead of ejaculating in my mouth, accidentally peed. So instead of a nice, cozy birthday morning cuddling in bed I had to rush to the toilet, mouth filled with pee. Thankfully we are comfortable enough with each other to be able to just laugh it off afterwards and the rest of the day went great with other (dry) activities, gifts and dinner at his favourite restaurant. 

TL;DR: TIFU by deciding to give husband a blowjob to wake him up on his birthday. He then accidentally peed in my mouth. We laughed it off, remaining day went great.

It’s all fun and games. Nothing serious. I go over, get on my knees, we both leave happy. 

So today while giving him a very sloppy service, he decided to straddle my face and make me lick his ass. I mean, I have done it once or twice. It’s not my first choice or second choice on the menu. But he seemed like he really wanted it, and I thought doing it would distract him from wanting to anal me, as he had stealthily moved from squeezing my butt cheeks to fingering my butt during BJ. I was not ready for anal.

So I let him squat over my face and plant his butt crack squarely on my face. I assumed all guys observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs. The BJ to ball licking to taint licking to butt licking transition happens enough that I assumed every guy cleans the entire pelvic region before a BJ session. 

I assumed incorrectly. I screamed into his ass canyon but my screams were muffled. I got out from under him so fast. I didn’t want to look at him. I didn’t want to talk about it. I saw his tightie whitie on the floor as I left, looking down to avoid any eye contact, and noticed the skid marks. The sight of it made me puke a little acid bile in my mouth. 

To top it off, on my way back to my unit, I had to wear a mask in the elevator, which only amplified the scent of his unclean ass. It was a no for me. 0/10. Do not recommend. 

TL;DR: I assumed all men observed the clean ass etiquette when they make their partners lick their butts. I was wrong.

Update 1: I just can’t stand awkwardness and I was pretty rude the way I ran out. I messaged him to apologize and clarified it was a hygiene issue, which he claimed he wasn’t aware of (how?). Anyway, I told him it wasn’t my favorite on the menu, but willing to do it if he cleaned thoroughly. Turns out he wanted to eat me out mostly, but thought he could only do it if he let me do it first. I clarified for him that he can feel free to dine out on my butthole and finger me all he wants. I don’t feel the need or desire to reciprocate. Just no anal yet. Communication and friendship re-established.

Update 2: Also, all these chat messages calling me derogatory names are stupid. You don’t know me. Be nice to others. Thanks."
d3woa0,TIFU By not washing my hair properly for over 10 years,28976,0.9,1857,2019-09-14 03:57:04,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d3woa0/tifu_by_not_washing_my_hair_properly_for_over_10/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d3woa0/tifu_by_not_washing_my_hair_properly_for_over_10/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I have not clue when this FU started but I do know that I realised my error at the age of around 25, I'm currently 34.

I was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular [image](https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.


Backstory:


Like most children, I was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt I was getting too old to have them help me, around 7, 8, 9 (for a guess, god knows). I remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. I used to hate it when my father washed my hair. He used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and I could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.


After I was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure I had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. It's only after realising my FU that I recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.

I can only presume that once I had the ability and trust to clean myself, I choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. For many years I would use shampoo and simply rub it onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that I thought sufficient before washing it off again.

I'm half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. I could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. I'm not sure whether this was a factor or not but I could never style my hair in any way. So It wouldn't need combing when I got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.


For as long as I remembered every time I went to the barbers I would notice a huge about of what I thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. I used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that I had a dry scalp condition. I even purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.


I couple of times a barber would tell me that I needed to clean my head properly. I just presumed that they didn't understand a dry scalp when they saw one. Before going to the barbers I would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later I would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.


One time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. I was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. At the end of this particular cut I looked like I had been out in the snow for an hour.


So the realisation came one day when I was around 24/25 and I was washing my ears. Other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, I never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. I don't know why but on this occasion I decided to put shampoo inside my ears. I washed around for a while and after a few seconds I start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.


I suddenly thought of the phrase 'squeaky clean', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. Memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. I had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since I was a kid.


I quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms I dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. After a while on a certain spot I heard/felt a squeak.


OMG! Right there and then I quickly realised that I didn't have a dry scalp condition, I had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. I washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.


I've made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. On the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn't been one since.


I told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that I didn't have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. I will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.


TL/DR

For ten years I thought that I was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because I had a dry scalp problem. It turned out that I just didn't know how to wash my hair properly.

I'd seen the guy, let's call him A, a couple times a few months back and nothing ever happened. I ended up getting into a relationship anyway so I thanked A for his time, but let him know I was now taken and with that I deleted the app.

Two months later and that fling had ended and I found myself wondering what ever happened to A. So I re-downloaded the cursed App and got to swiping with the sole intent of finding A again. Weeks passed and I had almost given up, I was going to forget A and just focus on the guys who I'd matched with along the way - but then I found A's profile! 

I swiped, we matched, and I instantly sent a message asking if he remembered me. He did, and we got to chatting and a couple days later we had organised for me to come to his house Tuesday night for pizza and drinks. All went well, he got me a vegetarian pizza and we had a lot of fun catching up, and this time around there was definitely a lot more chemistry... And by the end of the night one thing lead to another and we started hooking up in his bedroom. Here's where the fuck up happened.

Normally I have a pretty good gag reflex, but for some reason last night, God decided to look down on my with hatred as the most embarrassing moment of my life took place. I was going down on him, and he was enjoying it too, and moving his hips in time with me to help with the sensation. I guess we fell out of sync for a second because the next thing I knew, his dick was halfway down my throat and I baby barfed (you know that little bit of vom that you can usually just swallow back down?) Well this time, because his dick was in the way, I couldn't just swallow this baby barf away, and my attempt at doing so only made me gag on his dick more, and I proceeded to projectile vomit all over this poor dudes dick and crotch, and it was chunky, vegetarian pizza vomit full of spinach leaves, tomato, feta, and onions.

I went into shock but A was very sweet about it, he reassured me and got me a towel, took me to the bathroom and put me in the shower all while I was a crying, apologising mess. He said he was going to go and clean up his room while I shower and he kissed me on the forehead and told me it was all fine. After calming down in the shower, I then began to laugh uncontrollably at the situation because, let's face it, it was pretty funny albeit mortifying.

In the end he offered me to stay the night which I was very thankful for, because nothing would have been worse than to be kicked out after the whole debacle. The rest of the night and following morning was fine, we never spoke about the incident again, and I don't think I can ever eat vegetarian pizza again.

TL;DR: went on date, ate pizza, hooked up with dude, vomited all over him and his bed in the middle of oral sex, and was surprisingly NOT immediately kicked out of his house!"

It’s 2017 I had been dating my high school crush for 3 months now, meeting up at parties, getting drunk, the usual for a 18 year old, one day we decide that its time to spend the night together in my parents’ house, because, you know, 3 months is a “serious relationship” for an 18 year old. Obviously, I had to do some prep before she came over. Fairy lights along the bed posts (cause chicks love that…) tidy the room, change the bed sheets, apply a lil bit of lavender to the pillows, spray some nice cologne gotta smell fresh.

Fast forward a few hours, it’s about 11pm, we are in bed, nothing but fairly lights lighting up the room, love is in the air, super romantic, things get heated and before we know it we are on our way to pound town, bed is rocking giving the classic bed frame squeak, having the time of our lives.

So this went on almost every day for a year, she would come over, we would get down to business go to sleep, repeat. And I thought nothing of it. The only thing that I questioned was when my mum came up the stairs and passed me a bag full of condoms. Me being innocent was like “hmm why would I need these, mum? I don’t have sex?” she just said, “okay they’re there if you need them” and walked out. Anyway, that didn’t rouse any suspicion.

Now, mid-week, no one is in the house but myself and my girlfriend of a year and a bit. She sat down on the bed and it squeaked  a little bit, it had gotten worse over our year together and it made us think about how the sound might travel… Now I live in a two-story house, I stay upstairs, and my mum and stepdad sleep directly below me on the ground floor. So, I send the girlfriend downstairs into my mums’ bedroom and I jump on the bed making it squeak. she comes back upstairs with a horrified expression on her face, apparently the sound carries through the floor and is amplified by the hollow ceiling, acting like a big amplifier. So, my poor mother who has since bought an expensive pair of ear plugs has had to listen to my girlfriend and I going at it for the past year… I wasn’t able to look my mum in the eye for a few weeks after and I think she might have understood why.

TLDR : My girlfriend and I had been screwing for a year straight in a squeaky bed and my mum could hear everything and I didn’t know

Edit:Spelling of fairy lights was wrong

When i decide fuck it and blow my load i swear it was the most amount of nut i've ever seen but it was over quickly because i passed out. I woke up with a towel over me and nut all over my stomach and my mom who was back quicker than she was supposed to and she brought the family over. It was the most embarrassing thing thats ever happened to me and there was a live audience with front row seats to the reason i can't sleep at night.

But because it was so early when I went to bed, I just got ""prepared"". My intention was not to wake him up, but I wanted to be ready if he chose to pursue. 

Well, it did not happen, and since I had a buzz, I drifted off to sleep. My intention was to get up and remove it before I went to sleep, but as the title says, that did not happen. I woke up roughly 4 hours after being asleep, and remembered it was back there, so I reached around back to get it out, and when I felt nothing, my eyes popped wide open! I was fully awake! I got up and searched the covers, searched around the bed in case it fell, checked again inside of me, and nothing! I panic and I'll call my husband at work, and he was like ""it is a bit busy, is everything okay?"" And I am like ""No! I went to sleep with the butt plug and now I can't find it anywhere!"" He was like ""what, let me call you right back"" (I am assuming because he wanted to go into the break room for privacy). As I was waiting for him to call me back, I was like well let me go sit on the toilet right quick. After a few pushes, I hear a ""clink"" and I was so relieved because I did not want to be one of those dumb ass people that had to go to the hospital because they got something stuck up their butt! When he called me back I told him what happened, everything was safe now, he busted out laughing, I told him it wasn't funny because I was really stressing, he said ""if it was still in there I wouldn't have been laughing"". 

Later that day, after he gets off of work, he asked me if any zucchinis have came in, in my garden, I told him no but I have some cucumbers coming in, he said and I quote ""you're not going to lose them are you""! F*** that a******! I don't use food for that stuff!

When I tried it, alone in class 5 minutes before photoshooting, I couldn't buckle up few top buttons. I took my messenger camera, filmed how my boobs in bra were outside of shirt(completely), and also zoomed in pretty way too much. I pressed 'send to' and tapped on my best friend's name. As I did that, someone knocked on door. Fast as I could, I randomly threw my phone on desk and started to buckle up.

He’s generally very comfortable with me and  the physical contact in our relationships pretty adequate. 

Now this happened about 2 weeks ago. I was with him and a bunch of friends at some gig. It was late night and we both had smoked a couple joints before hitting the road. So we’re at the back of  the car wondering how we’ll fit six people in the back. We decide I will sit on top of my other friend Jade. We’re pretty far away from home and the area we’re driving through is a bit sketchy. Also the roads haven’t been done up in years so it’s a pretty long drive (45 mins on average). 

I’m sitting ontop of Jade and her legs were starting to hurt so I move onto my other friend and finally Scott. We have 30 mins of our ride left and I’m sort of on the edge of Scott’s knee, so i scoot backwards. Now my ass is kinda on his thigh but nothing crazy. As the road gets bumpier I keep getting tossed around, so I lean back trying to press into the window but there isn’t enough room for me to make the adjustment and I end up right on top of Scott’s dick. I try not to make eye contact and adjust forward but this on top of the bumps in the road make it sort of like a bouncing/grinding motion. Scott asks me to get up for a second so he can adjust his lap but that only makes it worse.

We sit like this in silence for 10 mins. 

And oh my god.

I felt it grow...

Now I don’t know if Scott knew I knew he had a semi but he out of the blue asks if he can place his hand anywhere since it’s getting uncomfortable and ends up placing it on my thigh. 

Oh cherry on top. We’re both soaked from the rain. I mean dripping wet. 

Now my back is pressed into his chest and I can feel his breathing a bit more intensely but I hold back a comment. And then the throbbing starts. I can feel Scott’s dick literally throbbing below me. 

He starts shaking his leg and clenching his thigh but I don’t know what that would do considering I am literally on top of him and it’s only making me bounce up and down on it. 

Another 20 mins of sitting like this.

Finally we pull up to our friends house and when we finally get off the first thing I see is him adjust his pants before walking hurriedly inside.

TLDR: Gave a friend an unintentional boner making it the most unusual car ride of my life.

I'm not a fan of grocery shopping, it's always crowded and chaotic. Usually I go together with my boyfriend so we can get it over with twice as fast.

Now, with the corona virus, they only allow an X amount of people in the store at the same time and they urge you to do your shopping alone and keep 1.5m distance. I decided I'd go by myself this morning, while my boyfriend is off to work (he has an essential job and still has to go every day). 

Luckily it wasn't too crowded this morning and I could get inside without waiting. Nevertheless, I wanted to go in and out as quickly as possible. Our supermarket has those hand scanners with which you can scan the products yourself, then after scanning you just have to pay and get out. I really like this because it's a lot faster than waiting in line for the cashier.

Inside the supermarket I was getting a little stressed as some people were not keeping their distance as they should be, so I started rushing even more. They had a pretty good sale on wine with 50% off, so I decided to take 2 boxes with me, 6 bottles each. I quickly loaded them onto my cart, grabbed the remaining items I needed and quickly went to the pay desk. Since I had some beer and wine, a lady came over to check my age and after that I could pay and go.

Once at home I checked the receipt to see if the discount from the wine was calculated correctly, but then I noticed the wine wasn't on the receipt at all! I must have totally forgot to scan it, so I just stole 12 bottles from the supermarket!

I just went to the supermarket again to tell them about my mistake. Both because it didn't feel right and because I didn't want them to find out and put me on a blacklist or something as I go there regularly. The cashier had to laugh at my story and could understand my mistake, she was very happy I came by again to pay anyway.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Due to the Corona virus I rushed my grocery shopping and forgot to scan 2 boxes of wine, thus ended up leaving without paying for them. Went by the supermarket again to pay this afternoon."

My whole family came over on the weekend and I was showing my 5 year old nephew how to use Google Home to change the color of the lights. Which he thought was the greatest thing in the world.

So cue the whole family coming to my bedroom to see the little guy having the time of his life. He says 'Hey Google!' followed by what sounded like a bit of gibberish. But Google Assistant thought he said 'wank mode'. Which just so happens to be one of the 'joke' routines I set up.. It gets triggered by saying either 'wank mode' or 'jerky jerky time'.

It basically goes like this.

Google Assistant says 'Engaging wank mode, my Lord'

THE WATER BOTTLE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED SAFE.

I went to the gym today and ran into her again. Ironically enough didn't even know she was there till I went to the back and pulled out my yoga mat to start stretching. She was already back there getting ready to leave (atleast it looked like)

By some miracle I was able to apply some of the breathing techniques so many kind people shared with me and was able to not only have a smooth conversation, I not once felt my anxiety set in till the conversation had actually ended. So thank you again for all of you kind reddit peeps.

She has my water bottle, she didn't have it with her but she says it's at her apartment (she forgot to put it back in her car after washing it she said). I out right told her sorry about the other day letting her know the mix of my nervousness and post workout exhaustion had my mind completely fried. She apologized again for interrupting my workout and said she should have waited till I left the gym to try and say anything to me on our way out.

We chatted for a good 10 minutes, mainly small talk about our workout routines, stuff we do outside the gym and a slight bit about our work lives. The conversation went smooth as butter for what I normally dish out. She gave me her phone number so I could reach out to set up a day to meet her at the gym next week to get my water bottle back.

I texted her a solid hour(ish) ago and we've just been chatting ever since. We're going to the local farmers market tomorrow to hang out and get some food. SHE IS GOING TO BRING MY WATER BOTTLE WITH HER!!

Needless to say, reddit came through. Thank you people. I truly am grateful for your kind words that helped me face anxieties I've dealt with for a few years now. Strangers on the internet aren't all bad and you kind people have been proof of that.

To clear a few things up off the rip; she offered me her phone number. I didn't go out of my way to ""pick up"" this girl at the gym. I didn't go back there anticipating to make a friend or get a date. My goal was to apologize and retrieve my water bottle as respectfully as possible. 

I've made a friend. That's all I know right now. That's enough for me. 

TLDR; Made a complete ass of myself at the gym infront of a cute girl, left my water bottle behind and my dignity, decided to confront my insecurities and mistake and turned out making a friend and finding my water bottle to be safe and sound in the process.

If you've messaged me asking for my breathing techniques; just breath. In through your nose deep, quick exhale through your mouth fast. So many people mentioned me how we forget to breath when anxiety takes over. Paying attention to my breathing the same way I do when running did me wonders.

If you've messaged me and ask for my gym routine or how to get started my honest answer is to just start. Anywhere. Doesn't matter if it's 10 push ups and a walk around your neighborhood. Just start. There is no glory in what you will be doing. Set small goals and achieve them. Take your small victories and build on them. My actual gym routine is a collaboration of workouts I've stolen from people who were more successful than I at the time. Find influencers that are actively trying to teach you, not show off their personal achievements (yes they exist) Hazzytrainer is a great place to start. He teaches alot about techniques and ways to avoid injury. All of the actual hardwork is done outside the gym. If you're looking to lose weight you MUST be in a calorie deficit. If you're looking to gain weight you must be in a calorie surplus. There are fairly easy and accurate ways to calculate these things. Best of luck.

Thank you again to all of you kind people."

UPDATE 1 (you can skip this if this is your first read through. It's just a big thank you to everybody)

I AM ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY by your kindness, your funny stories, and your willingness to take the time to read. You cannot, cannot, cannot know how all of your comments, good and bad, touched me.

Thank you for all the awards. I am now wealthy beyond all my hopes. I am having a new room built on to the back of my house so that I can display them.

Still trying to pay the kitty tax. Every day I get a little closer.

A bunch of you have requested chats. I'm looking forward in the next few days to reading up on what they are and how to do them.
😘❣️❣️

HERE IS WHERE THE ORIGINAL POST STORY BEGINS

A Lot of people don't understand what aging women go through when our bodies begin to betray us in astonishing and confusing ways. I am in my mid 60s. I have not been athletic in any way in at least 20 years. I'm lazy. I don't care. I am not apologizing. I am very much not athletic. No part of me is athletic from my fingertips to my toe tips.
Given this true fact I find it almost incomprehensible how I managed to get what I can only describe as athlete's foot in the folds of my upper thighs. Itchy, red for days. And no, dear internet acquaintances, it is not something that I earned through having wild animal sex with the pool boy. I don't even have a pool.

 The doctor basically said yeah, it happens. She told me to keep it clean down there and dry too. She gave me an ointment which did seem to help over time and when I ran out of the ointment I bought some antifungal spray which I have a very carefully applied to the tops of both of my legs twice a day. The good news is, it works. The bad news is, I'm an idiot.

Last night after carefully washing the basement of my body, I reached for the spray as I do every night. I carefully covered the delicate middle territory where Queen Ladybits rules, between the top of Leg One and the top of Leg Two so I would not get medicinal spray where it wasn't supposed to be. Just like every night. More regular than bedtime prayers. This is something the kitties know. This is not something highly unusual or fascinating.

Like lonely old ladies everywhere who don't know how to use that swipe left thing and would never ever try to meet a man or even a friend online, I have replaced anything resembling a social life with a number of cats. My cats and I love each other. They are three of the noisiest, most talkative little beasts I have ever known. They yell at me all day long, follow me from room to room, order me to change the cat litter RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE NOT KIDDING OR WE WILL PEE ON YOUR PILLOW , and other fun things. This is just to say that my kitties and I are very close.

However, some things are meant to be done alone. Without an audience. Some things are not participatory events. And anyway, me spraying my twattledeedee is a non-event as far as the beasts go.

So imagine my confusion when I did my nightly spray and all three cats corkscrewed their little faces and gazed at me in adoration. I thought to myself, huh. Sweet but weird.

And all of a sudden all three were in my lap nuzzling the moat that surrounds Queen Ladybits, purring loudly and rolling over on their backs to bat at invisible butterflies that seemed to be filling the air around them. I love my kitties, but this was just too... intimate. And weird. They were acting almost like they were stoned----ohhhhhhhhhhhh.

 I reached for my spray bottle of antifungal spray, brought it right up to my nearsighted old lady eyes and read the label. I really think that people who manufacture spray bottles need to be more careful not to make antifungal spray bottles look and feel like catnip spray bottles. I mean it just makes sense, right?

Yes, new internet friends, I will say it so that you do not have to. Since I was covered down there in catnip spray, of course my pussy was suddenly churning with a lapful of pussies.  

Fortunately, it all happened so fast that it did not occur to me to grab my phone and snap a picture so I can prove it later to any doubters when I'm telling my tail, I mean my tale. This is a good thing, because if I had a picture I'm pretty damn sure I would attach it to this post as proof. Because I'm weird. Because I'm one of those weird old ladies with cats instead of human friends. So it's in everybody's best interest to just take my word for it and be relieved that you do not have to see photographic evidence. 

TL;DR if you mistake athlete's foot spray for catnip spray, what happens next is your own damn fault.

Gahhh!  I THINK IT WORKED! Got them there just without the titles and descriptions. Jack is the big boy. Echolalia is the one with the spot on her nose. Joey is the one with eyes forever.  Now. For the kid who called me a karma whore, which I know is supposed to hurt my feelings but instead made me laugh, do you still need for me to post my birth certificate? Now that I know how to do it?"

A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&#x200B;

( now I've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&#x200B;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (FUCK..........MY...........LIFE) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER WILL I ENTER DRAMA AND IF MY NEIGHBOR IS SEEN AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS.

&#x200B;

TLDR - I saw a female neighbor that i didnt know at all crying. went to see if things were fine and it turned into getting puched, almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats"

My delightful wife only reminded me of this yesterday by forwarding the photos.  No, not those sort of photos you filthy minded swine!  It did, however, require copious amounts of eye bleach.


Setting the scene, I (36M at the time) and my older sibling (41F) were working through our recently-deceased mother's (74F) possessions in order to clear her house.  We stumbled upon her Kindle during our room cleanups, and my sister came out with the fatal line:


 ""Awww, she used to love reading.  I know she's bought tonnes of books from Amazon over the years.  I wonder what she's read recently?""

 
Blithely, I opened up my mother's Kindle library and, well...  

https://i.imgur.com/Oum9A9E.jpg


https://i.imgur.com/1yHvKbe.jpg

For those who can't be bothered to open the photos, they are a small sample of the titles she had purchased.  I snapped these photos in a moment of insanity but felt the need to keep some sort of evidence.

""Diapered for Pay"" and ""Breeding my Sleeping Wife"" are particular gems, however ""Hot Cooking Spanker"" takes on a new dimension when you consider her former occupation as a chef.

Suffice to say, the expression on my face made my sister grab it out of my hands.  Turning bright red, she muttered ""I knew I shouldn't have introduced her to 50 Shades"".

TLDR:  Found deceased mother's Kindle.  Discovered her late-life sexual awakening.  Not enough mental and eye bleach in the world sufficient.

Edited to add a couple of points:  Thank you for the awards, and thank you also for those pointing out the This American Life piece on https://www.thisamericanlife.org/689/digging-up-the-bones/act-two-4.  I'm thinking of tracking this guy down and starting a support group.

That is not me - today is the first day I've heard of that site, in fact.  I'll grant our stories are similar, although this was direct on my mother's Kindle and not via a shared account.  I am also British like the chap in the story, which is why this evokes a level of cringe beyond what you might normally expect.  We - and certainly folk of that generation - do not discuss sex, as a rule.

Lastly, I fully appreciate that yes, my mother had sex like any other person.  It's more the somewhat unusual choice of... ""content consumption"" at her advanced age which was slightly eyebrow raising.  Still, if it got her pulse racing, good for her."

All of last week, my boyfriend was out of town, dealing with a family issue in a small village over. Normally, I'm very tame, but because I really missed him during that week, I thought I'd send him a sexy pic while he was on the bus home. The picture was me, with one of my legs bent all the way up to my head, with my heel at the back of my head. There was a red bow around my dick, and my asshole was gaping open.

It wasn't until he came home and I, after an hour of being weirded out by his lack of commenting, asked what he thought, that I realized what I'd done. Checked the messages, and saw who it was for.

""I am so sorry, sir. That was meant for my boyfriend.""

""You're gay?""

Highest IQ moment of my life. The asshole told everyone at work - and there are over two hundred people at the firm, and I'm in charge of eighty of them. Went to work today, and was met with cold, dead eyes wherever I went. One of the girls working there is forbidding me from talking to her boyfriend (a handyman to whom I HAVE to talk) because she's afraid I'll seduce him.

My boss asked me to take some pics of a machine so he could see what was broken. As I was leaving, he added, ""No bows, please.""

TLDR: Sent my boss a nude pic, exposed my asshole, and exposed myself as gay. You know, as a kid, you always dream of that magical moment when you come out. This ain't it.

EDIT: Well, since this blew up, I'm giving a short update. My boss DIDN'T out me. His wife, who also works at the firm, heard him laughing at the pic after I sent it, and saw it when she came to investigate. She's the one who told everyone. I'm in the clear as far as getting into legal trouble goes, but a guy did practically run out of the bathroom today when I walked in.

As for the girl who thinks I'll seduce her boyfriend.... The two of them are related, and I am not going anywhere near that."

&#x200B;

My sister's wedding was last weekend. During a hurricane/tropical storm thing. I haven't lived in my hometown for several years, so hurricane/tropical storm survival skills are a little rusty.

My best friend drove, as I had flown in for the event and didn't rent a car. As we are about to leave, I remember that my lipstick is in the house, and in case they want to do pictures at the reception or after the ceremony, I need to be prepared. I run back in the house, grab my lipstick, run back down the driveway, and open the door to my friend's car.

In the .3 seconds that I stopped to open the door, my legs suddenly felt like they were ON FIRE. So when the door opens, I'm screaming ""I'm on fire!!!"" and my best friend looks totally befuddled as there is no evidence of anything burning. 3 seconds later, I realize I have been swarmed by fire ants.

Fire ants. In my shoes. In my clothes. In my hair. In the car. Hundreds of them. My best friend and I are frantically trying to get these ants off of me and out of the car. I run back in the house, and rinse my feet off in the bathtub. My feet are starting to swell. Throw on a pair of slip on casual shoes because my now-swelling feet won't fit in the shoes I brought to wear to the wedding. Get to the wedding, 10 minutes late, with whelps erupting all over my feet, legs and fingers. Found an ant crawling on my arm in the church.

Now, you know how when you've been itching all over you start to itch in places that shouldn't be itching? Like a phantom itch? Ok, so, I had an itch in my crotch during the wedding and reception. Yeast infection? No. Probably just a phantom itch because my entire body is itching from the 45 or so bites. Or so I thought...

A couple days later, I return home and me and the hubs have sexy time. He says ""you ok? things felt kind of... hard?"" I made some joke about getting old... well...

During my shower, I also realize things are.... hard. I intrepidly take a very graphic selfie to investigate.

Fire ant bites. On my inner labia.

There is no WebMD entry for how to treat fire ant bites on genitalia.

TLDR: Went to sister's wedding, came home a firecrotch. Fire ants swarm during heavy rain, kiddos.

&#x200B;

EDIT : RIP my inbox. Some items to clarify:

1. Bites are healing. Even THOSE bites.
2. Regarding attending a wedding in a pandemic - all of the venues limited the number of guests to under 50, even outdoors. The church holds 1100 people-- so all of us basically had a pew to ourselves during the ceremony. The reception venue holds 200 - only 40 or so people attended. Half of the attendees stayed in one section of the venue watching football on a big screen TV. Again, limited contact. And masks and sanitizer were available throughout the venues for people that didn't bring their own.
3. Yeah, I know, weddings are the new super spreader events and the decision to attend was not made lightly. I did spend all day Saturday before the wedding with my dad, helping him get ready, watching football, and going through his old high school yearbooks reminiscing about his friends and his memories. His wish was to have all of us together for a happy event one last time, COVID be damned. He gets tested approximately once a month as well. So far, he's still negative.
4. Fire ants form ""ant rafts"" in water as they try to escape their flooded mounds during heavy rain. Car was in the driveway. Ants had aggregated in a puddle next to the car, and that is what I stepped in.
5. Yes, I know ""whelps"" are puppies. However, my very southern dad has called ""welts"" ""whelps"" my whole life-- force of habit. I'm keeping it. "

My car broke down and had to call Uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I'm going to change the name of my job and the people I'm speaking of.)*

UD: ""Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?""

Me: ""It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.""

UD: ""Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?""

Me: ""Yeah man. I get you.""

UD: ""I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.""

Me: ""I'm glad to hear that. What is his name?""

UD: ""My boy Frank.""

Me: ""Frank...Gallagher?""

UD: ""Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.""

Me: ""Um..When was the last time you talked to him?""

UD: ""Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I'm going to hit him up soon.""

Me: ""I don't know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.""

UD: "".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.""

Me: ""I've been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.""

UD: ""No, he didn't. I'm going to call him right now because I'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.""

**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**

UD: ""He probably didn't pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha""

Me: ""Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.""

UD: ""He wasn't some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...""

Me: ""or early 50's? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I've ever trained. He died, man. I'm really sorry you found out like this.""

**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**

UD: ""I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!""

Me: ""I'm sorry...I don't know what to say"" *looks at the clock on my phone*

UD: ""He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40's bruh.*

He eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.

**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together.

**UPDATE** This has really blown up. I didn't expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages I received that say ""Kill Yourself asshole"" or ""Scum for doing that to a person"". [I screenshot'd the text message between the Uber Driver and I.](http://imgur.com/gallery/ErXBP) Wasn't mean or anything, he just wanted me to be certain about ""Frank"". "
96afny,TIFU by Reading Contract Law Textbooks to my 2 Year Old,28658,0.75,1971,2018-08-11 01:45:45,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/96afny/tifu_by_reading_contract_law_textbooks_to_my_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/96afny/tifu_by_reading_contract_law_textbooks_to_my_2/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.

Background filler:


(I graduated law school in December 2007 and passed the bar exam in February 2008.  I kept my BarBri materials as I was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state I was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)

The Story:


Our son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  He was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  One night I had enough and decided to find the most boring thing I could, so I pulled out my Barbri Book on Contracts and started reading it.  He was fascinated and demanded I read more and more.  He'd ask questions, like any good Dad I answered.  So I was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  

Fast forward to Kindergarten.  He got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did X and Y.  Well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  This did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  She had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.

Unfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  He would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  He will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  And if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   When they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  

This eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  Only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  He started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. He knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   We eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  

It culminated in Third Grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  This time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  So then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   Who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.

Now that this happened, we had to also see the Principal to discuss this.  She is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  So it is now put in his Education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  

TLDR: I taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  When he got to school he used these skills to play adults.

fcigbv,TIFU by creating a mini-misogynist and starting a violent feminist uprising in my preschool classroom,28639,0.81,1696,2020-03-03 02:02:36,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fcigbv/tifu_by_creating_a_minimisogynist_and_starting_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fcigbv/tifu_by_creating_a_minimisogynist_and_starting_a/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This actually happened today, typing this up on my lunch break while the kiddos are napping.

Background: I am a male teacher that works at a preschool attached to a church. I am not religious.

This morning, I saw one of my male students hit a girl. I pulled him aside and explained to him why he shouldn't hit anyone, but especially not girls because he's a boy. 

He asked, ""Why especially not girls? Does that mean I can hit boys and not get in trouble?""

Being that we are attached to a church, and because I honestly didn't have a better answer on hand, I thought it would be safe to reply: ""No, you need to always keep your hands to yourself but God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them, not hurt them."" 

Goddammit, I was wrong. Big mistake.

The little boy seemed to have an ""a-ha!"" moment in his head, as the idea clicked in his mind. ""OK, I won't hit girls. I will be strong and protect them."" he says. After a few more minutes of time out, and apparently mulling over the mildly misogynistic thought I just inadvertently planted in his head, I allowed him to go back and play.

Immediately, I knew I had fucked up.

""DID YOU KNOW THAT BOYS ARE STRONGER THAN GIRLS?!"" 

He's running around the room telling everyone with ears that boys are stronger than girls, quickly earning the ire of the girls in the class. 

Now, mind you, this is a stage of development where most of the girls in the class are actually bigger than the boys. The tallest of which immediately claps back at him, ""Nuh-uh! I'm bigger than all the boys in here, and I'm stronger too!"" 

He says ""It doesn't matter! Mr. Soprano just told me that God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them. Right, Mr. Soprano?""

I literally facepalmed. I weakly tried to walk it back, saying, ""Well some girls ARE stronger than boys but we should really just all keep our hands--OH MY GOD!"" I was interrupted by the girl screaming ""ATTTAAAAACK!!!"" as she punched the boy square in the stomach, and all of the girls stanced up to fight all of the boys 1v1. It was madness! I could see seething hatred oozing from the eyes of the girls, they were bloodthirsty after their strength was questioned. One girl started pretending to use force lightning on a boy. 

I got them to settle down, and had talks with all of them about keeping our hands to ourselves and not hitting ANYONE regardless of gender. I still heard bickering under their breath of which sex was the strongest, but I at least ended the violence. Crisis averted.

Anyhow, that's how (TL;DR) I mistakenly created a mini-misogynist and caused a feminist uprising in my preschool class by telling a boy that boys shouldn't hit girls because ""God made boys stronger"". Oof. Let's hope they forget it all happened completely after nap time."
izuqiy,TIFU by looking at my naked neighbour with binoculars,28639,0.89,813,2020-09-26 05:07:15,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/izuqiy/tifu_by_looking_at_my_naked_neighbour_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/izuqiy/tifu_by_looking_at_my_naked_neighbour_with/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"So this just happened a while ago. I live in a high rise building (19th floor) and recently ordered a pair of binoculars as I am going on a trip with some friends and thought it would be nice to have them just in case. Well the binoculars got delivered today and I decided to try them out. I was on my balcony looking at some other high rise buildings nearby when I ACCIDENTALLY looked inside an apartment at the building right across me (around 150-200ft away) and saw a naked middle aged woman who I think just got out of the shower (no idea why her blinds were open). Unfortunately, she saw me looking at her with the binoculars and ran into another room. I panicked as well and ran inside and closed my blinds. And now I’m just sitting here and hoping no one knocks on my door. I don’t even know how I will explain myself and if anyone will believe me.

TL;DR got caught looking at my naked neighbour with binoculars and now I’m shitting myself.

Update: So I left my apartment the day it happened for several hours and came back pretty late. There was a knock on my door yesterday and I obviously freaked out and was expecting to get yelled at but luckily it was just an Amazon driver delivering a package. It’s been over two days now and nothing has happened so I think I’m good."
j1azbc,TIFU almost choking my 6months old son to death.,28636,0.88,1600,2020-09-28 17:52:39,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j1azbc/tifu_almost_choking_my_6months_old_son_to_death/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j1azbc/tifu_almost_choking_my_6months_old_son_to_death/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This happened today during dinner time. And I still have all that adrenaline in me so I decided to share it here to help myself calm down.

Some background context before the fucked up. Me (25yrs), my wife (24yrs) and my son (6mths) are staying with my parents. My son has recently started on solid foods(puréed) and he enjoys it. Also, his motor skills has been developing much faster than most babies his age. So, many time we just let him be, thinking he'll be fine.

Moving on to the fuck up. During dinners my son would usually join us in his high chair eating his baby bites (biscuit for baby). It was the same tonight just that he was asking for more this time. So we decided giving him apples might be a good idea since he likes the puréed version. My mom then proceeds to cut a slice of apple (normal adult sized slice). We then feed him the apple, letting him suck on it. Then my wife asked my mom to cut smaller so that he can eat it. My mom replied saying that she's worried that if it's too small he might end up breaking it with his gum and choke himself. But in the end we somehow got my mom to cut it into smaller bite size.

So, we just continued our dinner while talking about what to do if a baby does get choke, heimlich maneuver, CPR... Basically topic around those area. Then we hear a tiny apple crunch. He was still happily eating, so we continue chatting and eating. But shortly after my wife shouted for me saying he's really choking. I turned and saw my son's face turing red-purple-ish, no sound was coming out of him. I instantly shot up from my chair removed him from his high chair and tried to perform the heimlich maneuver for babies, basically mimicking from a vague memory of what I saw on YouTube years ago. And then he cough and started crying. This was the first time that I'm glad to hear my son's cry. 

Now I'm having a slight headache from all that adrenaline rush. But I'm glad my son is alive and kicking. Thanks to that random YouTube video I watch years ago.

Edit 1: my wife saw this post and she corrected 1 of my mistake. It was actually my sister who suggested to cut the apple into smaller slices. We just didn't disagree with the idea.

Edit 2: OMG... This really blew up I posted this before going to work (I work night shift), it was only about 100+ up votes before I left for work and I could still keep up with all the comments. While I was at work, I kept receiving notifications... Then I saw 2k up votes... And now 20k... I never thought my first post on r/TIFU would get 20k up votes and thousand over comments and all those awards. Really want to thank everyone for your concern. My son is fine, actively crawling around

Edit 3: I saw some comments about CPR certification. I served the military for 2 years. So I was trained to do CPR. But on adults. Not babies. I only knew about it cos I spend way too much time on YouTube.

Edit 4: just saw many comments about led weaning. We are doing this. Usually we would mesh bananas, sweet potatoes, saute apples, It's just this one time that we decided it's fine to let him suck on the apple and some how ending up letting him eat it... Horrible mistake which we will never forget.

Edit 5: I realized I might have used the term ""heimlich maneuver"" wrongly what should I call it tho? Heimlich for babies maneuver?... What I did was holding my son face down at about, legs slightly higher up and I slap/thrust/pat(?) I think it was more like a pat/slap. I was panicking and everything I did was base on my vague memory of a video from youtube... In the moment I was more like do whatever possible to save my son.

TL;DR we fed my 6 months old son some apple causing him to choke. I performed the heimlich maneuver for babies base on a vague memory of a YouTube video to save him."
dobh7w,TIFU by Smeagoling at my new job,28611,0.95,824,2019-10-28 22:18:01,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dobh7w/tifu_by_smeagoling_at_my_new_job/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dobh7w/tifu_by_smeagoling_at_my_new_job/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This happened today. About 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.

I just started a new job about a month ago. It's a quiet office environment. I only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.

One of the things I love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. This morning I thought a bagel sounded nice so I went to go toast one up. This is where the FU begins. 

I separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. I've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a ""bagel"" setting. I figured it wouldn't hurt so I punched it and waited. 

While I stood there my mind began to drift. I started thinking about Lord of the Rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. I heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.

Then the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. I took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. Warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. I started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. My brain was still in fantasy mode though, and I said to myself in full-on Smeagol voice, ""Oooh yes! We likes it! Gives it to us golden and crispy!""

At this point, my rational brain kicked back in and I realized how fucking weird I can be sometimes. Oh well, no big deal. I take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like I just arrived from another planet. I tried to give a polite smile, but I'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness I was experiencing made that creepy too. I shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before ""the new guy"" is rebranded as ""the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself."" Shit.

TL;DR Talked like Smeagol while buttering my bagel and was overhead by my new coworkers. Instant shame."
95q1fs,"TIFU by kicking a chestnut, stopping traffic for an hour and getting cornered by a lynch mob",28614,0.79,1330,2018-08-09 02:33:09,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/95q1fs/tifu_by_kicking_a_chestnut_stopping_traffic_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/95q1fs/tifu_by_kicking_a_chestnut_stopping_traffic_for/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So obligatory this happened yesterday but I’m still traumatised as I’ve never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.

So let me set the scene first. I live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in Europe that has a good amount of nature patches. The people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. The location of this FU was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. Anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in Europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.

I was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as I was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. Picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that’s me. Suddenly, I bump my head into a rock - or so I initially thought. I look up. It was the largest man I’ve ever seen - about the size of the mountain from GOT. He looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let’s call him ARNIE). I was startled for a second before I see his buddy (let’s call him SLY) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. “Oi, watch where you are going” I bellow (jk, obviously Arnie did). So being super alpha and dominant I mumble “Sorry” and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. “I mean how the f\*\*\* was I meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other.” I think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. And oh boy that worked - somewhat. What happened next I could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. Hey, I mean even with the current AI technology I doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.

I see the chestnut flying Roberto Carlos style towards the junction (hell, I heard the crowd roaring) and IMO it probably even broke the sound barrier. While the chestnut was still in flight I raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. And I’m talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-Susan from middle-school hand raise (no, Susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).

Suddenly everything kept coming down.

The chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. Remember how I said they had nature patches in the city? Well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.

You guessed it, despite almost 40°C there was a puddle the size of a small American town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. His breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. Behind him, a red car doesn’t manage to break in time but does a Fast and the Furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. Then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car’s path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. By a miracle of God (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. Yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. What followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.

And then a split second of silence.

Until I hear a majestic roaring that Simba would be proud of: “DUUUUUUUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!!!”, yup Arnie and Sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. They start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let’s call him Miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a Cyberman.

At that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. My future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. I was not going to make it a single night in prison.

Suddenly the commotion starts - picture a Real Madrid vs Barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. I’ve never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their Super Saiyan form on me while I was still trying to flee Miyagi’s claws (I know, statistically not all of them could have been Super Saiyans but still). What I haven’t mentioned yet is that I actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive Europe - yeiy). Throughout I just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by Arnie, Sly, and Miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.

After about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. I think Sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only I could see and pointed into his direction. I am no fighter but I took one class of Wing Chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. ’trap the dragon’s head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites’. As Sly got down to his last finger I do the Kung Fu twist with my arm, break Miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards Sly. For a split second I thought I’d run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, I was impressed). And then the sprint of a lifetime started. I was Powell, Bolt, and Blake at the same time. I ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). Luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind Arnie and Sly cause they figured I’d never get past them, so I didn’t actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. I see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought I was somehow involved) so I kept running and I had a good 100 m head start. I was just in front of my apartment block when I had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way I would show them where I lived, so I ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until I reached a park to lie down. I was pretty sure that I lost most people when I passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but I had to be sure.

I cool down and call my neighbour who’s flat looks down on the junction. I told her the whole story (she’s a super old family friend) and she couldn’t believe I was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). Turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren’t harmed either. According to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.

Something I didn’t realise from my POV was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn’t drive… and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. His insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).

I haven’t left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that I made frozen pizza, and I promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.

tl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running

EDIT: Submitted this around midnight and went to bed to wake up to a blowing up inbox. Thanks guys. Also thank you so much for the gold. I put somewhere in the comments that excessive humour is my coping mechanism to deal with things. I apologise if that style really wasn't your jam and will work on semantics for the future. If you did enjoy it, you're welcome - we probably could make great friends in RL. And yes English is not my mother tongue, and I lived all around so that's why my units of space and mass are very all over the place. "

I open it up and chrome is open on reddit with her signed in. I know IATA here but I was curious and honestly hoping to find some nudes that we could use later to try and spice things up(idiot). 

A little backstory. I am an individual with serious mental health challenges and lately my depression has gotten the better of me and was sucking the life out of my wife. She has told me as much. I never thought I would be winning husband of the year awards but I genuinely love my wife and would do anything for her. I'm probably letting myself of too easy. Anyways in December my wife tells me that she can't handle it anymore and I need to get my stuff together or we're done. I have given every effort possible since then, multiple counselling sessions a week, changes in medicine, changes in careers and feel like I've made solid progress.

Back to my fuckup, I see her profile and notice the most recent post was really highly liked (3k+) and even given an award, Cool! Then I read it. I won't go into specifics because some degenerate will track the post down but needless to say it paints me very negatively. She describes me with very harsh language and this was all brought on by a fight we had that I will admit was not my finest moment. I get upset after reading the first couple of lines and give up, close out of the browser and prepped for my presentation. Later that night my wife notices that I'm upset and asks me what is wrong. I try to avoid the confrontation because we had been doing so well but she persists and I brake down. I tell her that I saw her post and that I was sorry, I had no right to look at her account. I told her I wasn't angry at her for making the post but it did really hurt and killed any self-confidence I had left. In a credit to our couples therapy we talked it out like adults and she even read me the post in full and said that was it. We make up and all is well not good but atleast ok.

As I'm laying in there in bed something is nagging at me. Something about the way she kept saying that was it made me feel like she was hiding something and lying to me. So I get up and go to the living room and Fuck up again by looking her post up and finding her account. I read for hours, she only had one other post about me but it was fairly generic deadbeat husbands asks me to make breakfast on my morning off(I'm working on not doing shit like that now sorry honey). Then I look at her comments. I get why she lied and said the one post was it, she was protecting my feelings. She hates me. She doesn't think counselling will work. She's just biding her time to kick me out. I am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities. She doesn't enjoy our sex life and feels like it ranges from a forced chore to pathetic and boring.

I plan to talk to her about it. I know I am the asshole in this for reading her shit. This is the love of my life and mother of my children. I have destroyed everything good in my life. Its over. I have no chance to save it.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Borrowed my wife's laptop and found her reddit account. She hates me."

So I’ll begin where I left off yesterday.

[original post if you haven’t seen it](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iooq39/tifu_by_putting_my_boss_in_the_hospital/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Paramedics loaded my boss onto a wheeled stretcher (or whatever they call them) and put him in the back of an ambulance to go off to the hospital. I seriously thought that he was in big trouble because the paramedics were treating him like he was having a severe heart attack. He looked like he was on the verge of dying as they loaded him up. 

Anyway, afterwards my other manager tells us all to go home. It was Labor Day so there weren’t that many people working. I go home and am freaking out, nervous as hell until my manager called me and told me my boss was stable but it was close. “Come in tomorrow for work at 10am we need to have a discussion”

At this point I’m double freaking out because I’m thinking “shit I’m going to get fired over a stupid ass spider prank.”

I get into work at about 950 and I make the dreaded trip up to my desk. At this point everyone in the office knew I basically killed our boss and literally everyone stopped to stare at me. I just kinda tried to keep my head down as I was thoroughly embarrassed. 

I got to my cubicle and my manager was already standing there, “don’t put your stuff away this will take just a moment.” 

He takes me to my bosses office. Which I thought he was going to ask what the spider on the fishing line was doing there and then, after I answered, fire me. 

Door was already open and after I walk in my manager tells me to take a seat and then he closes the door after I step in (he stayed out).

I sat down, pretty much sweating out of my clothes and all the sudden, to add insult to injury, my boss sneaks up behind me and yells “THOUGHT I WAS DEAD HUH!!!” 

Well at that point I basically shit my pants frightened like a little girl seeing a monster in the closet. He claps me on the back and I turn around. The fucker is wearing no shoes and was hiding behind the door to creep up behind me.

At this point I’m both relieved, terrified, and just generally shook. And he sits down and tells me how he did it.

Apparently the manager (my buddy from last post) that let me in early on Labor Day told him about my entire plan. My boss knew about the spider and pretty much planned around my move

The fucker literally let a bunch of workers have a half day to foil my prank and got his EMT buddy to make a quick stop by to “treat his heart attack.” 

I’m never pranking my boss again. On a good note I’m not fired

Tl;dr had a juicy prank for my boss, he faked a heart attack, let half the workers have a 1/2 day, scared the shit out of me by coming back to life, and now I’m not fired and never pranking again.


Edit: wow had no idea this was going to become popular. Thanks for all the awards and stuff guys and thanks for all the kind words. I hope y’all have a good rest of the week :)

anucbd,TIFU by getting so high I thought I predicted my own death,28580,0.88,855,2019-02-07 00:49:23,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/anucbd/tifu_by_getting_so_high_i_thought_i_predicted_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/anucbd/tifu_by_getting_so_high_i_thought_i_predicted_my/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this TIFU. Burner because reasons.

After taking a break from smoking for a few months, I decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge I bought a while ago and let the good times roll. I’ve been hitting it the past few days, and each time I get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and I don’t know when to stop hitting it.

I was on Facebook yesterday morning when I was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. The top comment on it was “he pasta way,” and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.

Later that night, I was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food I had brought back with me from home (I’m a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). One of the containers was a tortellini salad, and I noticed it had a “sell by” date of four days before. I was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. I had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.

A few hours later, the high times have come and I’m hitting my vape pen. After watching a Rodney Dangerfield classic, I go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden I start feeling a sense of doom. I start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. 

At the same time, all I could see in my head was “he pasta way” and started thinking that I was an almost 23-year-old college senior and I ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. I suddenly realized that I never saw the guy’s name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. Shortly thereafter the EMT side of me takes over, checks that I have a pulse when I’ve pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and I basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure I’m alive.

I was in bed with my boyfriend, just watching Shark Tank. Out of nowhere we decide to get it on. My boyfriend, being the saint he is, decides he wants to go down on me and seriously goes to town (sorry for that detail lol). I’m totally into it, obviously. Suddenly he stops to say something to me and I don’t really think much of it. Then all of a sudden, like the force of a thousand winds, my crotch starts burning. It’s on fire. Suddenly the realization hits me, we ate jalapeño poppers as part of our dinner that night. Fuck, I got jalapeño juice in my puss. I held my flaming crotch and hobbled over to the bathroom. While he tries to muffle his laugh in the other room, I have tears starting to form from the pain. I soaked my crotch in cold water and felt some of the best relief of my life. Eventually my crotch started feeling better, so I got back in bed and decided to not make jalapeño poppers for a while.


TL;DR: I let my boyfriend go down on me and totally forgot we ate jalapeño poppers that night. Holy hell, did my vag hurt."
a66i2y,TIFU by going on my first date in years,28537,0.89,1486,2018-12-14 22:18:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a66i2y/tifu_by_going_on_my_first_date_in_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a66i2y/tifu_by_going_on_my_first_date_in_years/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"So usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but I've only just recovered enough to talk about it. 

Also for context I am a detective with the police which was on my profile.

So I have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. I was recommended Bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.

I downloaded the app Thursday and by Friday I had a date so I thought things were going well. First date I arrange for Saturday at a busy shopping centre.

Now I've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see Mortal Engines.

I knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole ""hey is that x? 《YOU NOW HAVE 1 SECOND TO DECIDE ON KISS ON CHEEK, AWKWARD HUG OR LAME WAVE THING》 but what happened was none of those things. Instead I get hit with "" TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I NEED TO VERIFY YOU"" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing ""let's have a toast for the pretty lady!""

Anyway she then asks ""WHAT'S THAT ON THE FLOOR"" pointing to a large pile of dust. It's a pile of dust I tell her and she makes me double check.

Dust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《YOU ARE NOW LOCKED INTO THE DATE》

We got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to Starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me ""...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with..."" 

Now I've got some H.P. Lovecraft dark stories so I try to give her a PG version of a double murder I had some involvement with. (Note: everything I discussed could also be easily read about online)

""HOW DID HE KILL THEM? WAS THERE A LOT OF BLOOD? DID YOU SEE IT? WAS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? I LOVE MURDER STORIES, HAVE YOU SEEN MAKING A MURDERER? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X MURDER? DID YOU KNOW THIS ONE GUY ONCE CHOPPED HIS MUM'S HEAD OFF AND HAD SEX WITH THE CORPSE ISN'T THAT FACINATING?!?!""

(Let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)

She also hits me with a few probing questions ""Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever done drugs?!""

Trying to recover some semblance of a date I joke ""haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime""

Next it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic ""Tell me about your self"" (I know it's lame but I panicked)

""Oh I've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in Broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and I got to meet people like naked Phillip""

Now gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double D breasted woman feels in a slasher flick I decide I have two choices.

1) Run into the crowd and disappear

2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? It's just 2 hours of awkward silence)

Let's just say I chose poorly...

Before we move off though she asks me to search her chair... I don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.

Finally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the Red Sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.

Suddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! The woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling ""MY EYES! TURN OFF THAT LIGHT!! ARRGHHFYFBIFWYH""

my date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady ""I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT I TOLD YOU TURN THAT LIGHT OFF"" 

I'm not about to white knight defend this woman, I'm a god damn spectator here! The fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.

Date goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time I have to step in and say thus is not ok.

So movie time. I'm sure Mortal Engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. All I'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice I was given prior to app dating

1) don't get drunk
2) don't send dick pics
3) don't stick your dick in crazy 

So despite the horror movie Mortal Engines has become I am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so I'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. Lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.

After the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...

She returns dead serious ""I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME""

this is where I die i think, I'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.

She walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust

""WHAT'S THAT?""

I say just a large pile of dust ""ARE YOU SURE, CAN YOU CHECK"" 

Sure enough it's just dust...

So keen to make good my escape I lay down a ""woah look at the time... 8:30! Got to grab that train"" she responds ""you know I'm really thirsty... could really go for a drink!""

Not willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede I push on ""central line that's Me! Oh you too? Great..."" 

Next she smashes out a ""you know the Overground train for me is an hour wait.... I don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty..."" 

The next stop I just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, ""oh look at This! Haha my stop lovely to meet you BYE"" 

The journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...

TLDR

My first date in years was with someone murder obsessed and recently released from a mental health facility. Now too scared to date anyone ever again."

My family of 5, plus my boyfriend went on a road trip to camp on the beach a few hours away. We have a minivan so that we could all travel together. Overall it was about a 4 day round trip once we got there and stayed a couple days before coming back. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I weren't able to fool around during this time.

On the way back my boyfriend and I were sitting in the back of the van. Everyone was ahead of us, so they couldn't see us without turning around.

We started texting some naughty things about what we'd like to do to each other and I got extremely turned on. This went on for quite a while and progressed into us touching ourselves while we were looking longingly at each other. Needless to say, I was SOAKED.

Of course, since we were driving and my dad is pretty stingy with bathroom breaks I couldn't exactly clean myself up. My underwear were completely soaked and I had no option but to sit in it until we got home.

When we got home all was good. My bf and I snuck off to have sex and it was great.

However, if you are aware of female hygiene practices at all, sitting in a wet bathing suit or underwear is a big no no. Your lady parts are supposed to stay pretty dry for the most part.

For several hours that day, mine did not, and I payed for it by waking up the next day with the absolute worst yeast infection I have ever experienced. It was horriible and took over a week of embarrassing-to-buy over the counter drugs to fix it. Will NOT be doing that again!


Tl;dr got so horny I gave myself a yeast infection


Edit: Holy crap guys, that's a lot of upvotes! Thanks for laughing at my pain!! 😁"
jv3jfk,TIFU for telling my dad it's time to euthanize him,28513,0.95,594,2020-11-16 14:14:42,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jv3jfk/tifu_for_telling_my_dad_its_time_to_euthanize_him/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jv3jfk/tifu_for_telling_my_dad_its_time_to_euthanize_him/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Little back story, I live in Belgium where we have fairly solid Euthanasia laws. Without knowing all the details, it basically requires a lot of paperwork and a couple of signatures (in our case my sister and myself, and a 3rd witness); and all this needs to be renewed every 5 years. It's basically a will/permission that gives my sister and I the authority to decide in his name (i.e. respect his wishes) if he is no longer able to himself. Last June he had a stroke at age 77 and has since mostly recovered. Accordingly we discovered that the paperwork needed to be renewed around this time of the year.

My sister is the principal contact on the paperwork and as such she was going to take care of it (like she has always done before). She is a schoolteacher and this morning the schools are opening again, so the past weeks have been a bit hectic for her.

Last night I went to bed around 3 a.m. and this morning shortly after 8 am - while still sleeping -  I get a call from a city clerk. The paperwork was still missing the signature of my dad, and apparently she had been trying to contact my sister to no avail. So she reached out to me before it expires and gave me an appointment in about 2 hours from now.

My dad recently became my neighbor, and is usually already awake this time of the day sitting in his office. So still somewhat sleeping I put on pants and walk over to his house. Oddly enough he is still sleeping so I wake him up (which requires specialized skills).

""*Huh what*?""""*wake up dad*""""*huh? oh its you? huh what*""""*they called for your Euthanasia, we need to be there at 11h15*"" (im still not fully awake)

He looks totally bemused at me, sits on the bedside for a couple of seconds and gives me this look of utter defeat and says: ""*well shit, that's fast*"". To which I say, ""*well we still have more than 3 hours, so no rush, I'll pick you up around 11, cya*"".He mumbles totally disappointed: ""*3 hours and you gonna leave me alone*""? At which point my penny drops (technically speaking eurocent): ""*you stay in the car, I pick up the paperwork, you sign it, I return it and we are good again for 5 years, turns out my sis forgot something*"".

Never seen him being more relieved before in my life! Turns out he had been dreaming about it in some way or form and me putting it like that made it all a little bit too realistic for him.

TL;DR while being sleepdrunk I woke up my dad and told him we get to do his Euthanasia later this morning. He took it a bit too literal.

*Edit 1: It is my dad his own decision that he wants to be euthanized if he ever ends up in a situation where he has to live in a vegetative state with zero quality of life. He talked about this extensively with his doctor, with the family, friends, ...  At first I wasn't very happy to sign that paper, but in the end it's his choice. And respecting his whish is important to me. There is a whole process involved: first off all the paperwork which can be seen as his will/testament. Second off, if god forbid he ever ends up in such a situation, there is another legal process we'll have to go through before it can happen. Third off, there is no way whatsoever that me or anyone who signed that document can enforce anything while he is still mentally sound.* 

*Edit 2: When this conversation took place my dad was somewhere in the middle between sleeping, dreaming and waking up. And I wasn't fully awake yet either, or else I'd have just told him ""they called for your Euthanasia* ***paperwork, it's missing a signature,***  *we need to be there at 11h15"".* 

*It's as simple as me failing to form a coherent sentence (not fully awake yet) towards my dad who is still in lalala land. Some of these comments are batshit crazy.*"

Just wanted something to do for the weekend instead of just sitting around doing nothing all day. 

After drinking I decided to pull some money out of the ATM and go looking for a roulette table. I’m not one to gamble much so I only took out a couple hundred and only found tables with $50 minimums. Not wanting to lose my money in 5 minutes I thought, why not go looking for a different table? 

I took a walk and while passing some slot machines I saw some girl looking at me smiling. I looked away and then turned back and she was still looking at me. She waved and called me over and we starting talking. She basically gave some story about her mom in bad health and she was just looking to go out and drink and have “fun”.  She then leaned forward and grabbed my groin in the middle of the casino floor. 

After missing several red flags, I thought to myself, “I haven’t been laid for a minute, fuck it, I’ll have a one night stand if she’s just dtf.” So off we go to my room. 

We get to the room and I say, “so you’re not just looking for a place to stay for the night right?” And she says, “No, I live here, I’m just looking to have fun. I thought you said you’ve been to Vegas before?” I tell her yes but maybe not the real Vegas. 

After a short pause and a confused look she says, “Uh, I’m working…” after another short pause she says, “Sorry, I thought you knew.” 

I was surprised, but more so with the fact that I was that oblivious. I’ve been in a weird situation before where two girls at a bar decided to dance with me and pick me up so I just thought this was just going to be some crazy out of the blue hookup. 

She tells me that she’ll at least need 10 dollars since I basically just cost her money. Awesome thing about taking out hundreds in Vegas is now I only have hundred dollar bills. I wanted to make a joke about asking for change, but I just gave her a hundred and said, “sorry for wasting your time”. All I could think of was a joke about possibly paying for an STD instead of just having a one night stand and it being free. 

My friends asked me at that point why I didn’t just go through with it. I gave it a thought, but paying for it would not have been worth it. 

I laid in bed for an hour after that. After not being able to sleep, with my last hundred I took it to roulette and lost in 5 minutes. I then drove home at 4 AM. 

TL;DR: I picked up a girl thinking I was just going to have a one night stand, but she was a prostitute."
ojnmbm,TIFU by sleeping naked.,28497,0.86,1211,2021-07-14 01:30:19,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ojnmbm/tifu_by_sleeping_naked/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ojnmbm/tifu_by_sleeping_naked/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"A little backstory

My husband and I sleep naked, always have. We like the skin on skin contact and it’s overall comfier to not worry about getting tangled up in pajamas at night. Lately he’s been working a night shift for his job, and I’ve been sleeping alone at night. Naked like usual. 

About a month ago, right when my husband started his night shifts, we got a kitten. She’s our first pet and everything we could have asked for. She’s adorable, lively, and at times very crazy and sassy. She sleeps in our bed at night, most of the time right above my head on my pillow because she likes my hair. 

Recently however, she’s started to enjoy sleeping under the covers between us. We don’t mind, so long as we don’t squish her (We’re pretty good at staying put at night, I don’t think rolling onto her is very likely).

Onto the FU. Last night was a regular work night for my husband. He goes to work and I go to bed at around 11pm, naked. Our kitten follows suit and cuddles up under the sheets with me. I fall asleep not knowing the pain I’m about to feel a few hours later. 

Cut to 2am, I wake up PANICKED about a red hot stinging pain on my chest, like someone had grabbed my nipple with a flat iron and twisted it as hard as they could. I’m still half asleep at this point, and couldn’t seem to figure out exactly what was wrong and why I was in so much pain. I frantically flipped the sheets over, grabbed at my boob, and finally realized what was causing the red hot nipple pain. 

It was our kitten, who had probably woken up to play with her tail and saw my boob as a great chew toy opportunity. She bit my nipple HARD. Naturally I grabbed and almost threw her across the bed, which hurt even worse because she bit down harder as I pulled her off. I yelled some gibberish obscenities at her then proceeded to wrap myself tight in the sheets to keep her out. I spent the next half hour or so rubbing my throbbing nipple and trying to keep the tears at bay until I could fall back asleep. 

It’s now about 1PM the next day and my nipple still feels sore. It hurts to wear a bra and I can still somewhat feel that burning sensation from being pinched with her tiny sharp teeth. I can’t believe she didn’t break skin or leave a bruise or anything.

While I still think she’s the sweetest kitten in the world, I’m now very much aware of the inner nipple-biting gremlin. 

I think I’ll wear a T-shirt to bed tonight…

TLDR: I slept naked and my kitten bit my nipple while I was asleep."

I'm fairly tall, bald and bearded and have been told I am intimidating to look at (Relevant later)

After a uni class, I went back to a friends for a smoke. A few hours later, I'm fairly baked and begin my walk home.

It's pitch black and my paranoia was kicking up a storm so I sped up to get home as quickly as possible.

At one point, I am walking along a dark street and there is a girl in front of me. No issue, I try to speed up to overtake her but as I get close she speeds up and pulls away.

Confused as to why she is walking so fast, I attempt to over take again. Same thing happens.

She begins to look behind her every so often and this freaks me out... What is she running from?? My paranoia kicks in harder and now I am constantly looking behind us for what we are running from.

The idea that she is being chased just pushes me further into paranoia and again I try to speed up to overtake her and outrun whatever is behind us.

As I get close, she speeds up. Whatever is behind her is obviously terrifying and deserves to be run away from. This happens a few more times. 

At one point, both of us are power walking along this street. Terrified of what is behind us when it hits me.

It's me. I'm what she is running away from.

I stop dead, pull my phone out and sit on a wall, all the whole kicking my stoned little mind for concocting a terrifying monster while this girl is running for her life.

TL;DR Got stoned, chased a girl while thinking we were being chased."
dbiypa,TIFU by losing track of where my dog is.,28487,0.92,538,2019-10-01 03:22:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dbiypa/tifu_by_losing_track_of_where_my_dog_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dbiypa/tifu_by_losing_track_of_where_my_dog_is/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"Throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.

So I live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. This morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. By the time i’d gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.

Now i wasn’t too concerned since she can’t get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn’t lost. After searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she’s a lazy pupper). I went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn’t want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.

So the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. I have a small sister who doesn’t like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is “banished” to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. After checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she’d gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.

In i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. They must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_

Turns out 30 seconds wasn’t fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i’m pretty sure my dad’s dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). I was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.

My sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. And yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.

TL;DR: let my dog slip into my parent’s bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.

Edit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while."

So I gave one of my coworkers a ride home a few Fridays ago. Him and I started chatting about people who work at town hall in the next town over. I had mentioned that my grandmother had worked their for 40 years and I mentioned the last name of my grandmother (for the sake of this post i’m just gonna say the last name is Smith).

He told me that he has relation to the Smiths also so him and I started digging into how we are related. 

I asked him if we could call his father or mother and he told me his father had passed away when he was young. I asked him what happened if he didn’t mind sharing and he said he really doesn’t know, no one will tell him which is okay because he doesn’t really want to know anyway.

So we keep digging, we tried calling a bunch of our family members but they didn’t answer the phones, except for my aunt.

Mind you we are in the car at the moment and my phone is hooked up to the speakers so anything anyone says on the phone can be heard by everyone in the car. 

I get in touch with my aunt and I ask her how we are related to his side of the family, she basically told me that my great grandmothers sister is his great grandmother. So all in all, pretty far line down to be considered close cousins. 

My aunt keeps talking and she asked me why I asked? I told her that my coworker and I found out that he’s somehow related to the Smiths and we were trying to see a connection. She asked me what his name was and I said (for the sake of this post we will refer to him as Bob) Bob. I completely failed to mention to her that he was in the car with me at the moment. She says, “Oh, his father unfortunately hanged himself a few years ago”

I tried to mutter her out of what she was saying but failed to do so and Bob heard everything. I saw his eyes widen and what seemed to me, pale. I just told my aunt thank you and hung up the phone completely embarrassed that he found this out in not the most ideal way. 

Bob said to me “Well that explains a lot” I didn’t want to pry so I just said yea and i’m sorry. He didn’t really say much after that and he left. Whenever I see him at work now it’s really awkward for us and I think it really messed him up. I feel so bad but not sure what to do as I don’t want to bring up his fathers death at all.

TL;DR
Tried to find out how me and my coworker were related (whose father passed away and doesn’t know nor doesn’t want to know how he died) and my aunt accidentally blurted out that his father hung himself without knowing I was on speaker.

Update: Saw everyone’s advice this morning and decided to talk to him. Gave him a ride home again and talked about it. He said he was kind of happy finally knowing about it because it put his mind at rest. Told him if he ever needs to talk or anything that he can call me up or whatever to talk about it. He thanked me and then we bs’ed for like an hour about whatever. Feels good to have a cousin that I have stuff in common with too, never really had one that I got along with.

Also, saw some comments referring to him saying he didn’t want to know about his fathers death and the immediately after I said we kept digging. We kept digging about the relation, not his fathers death. Just to clear that up."

I had a really great day with my husband and wanted to give him an extra good time by giving him a blow job when we got back to the house. I started and everything was going great until I thought I heard him say “you look so sexy” with some mumbles after but I wasn’t sure if he actually said something more or moaned. He tells me I look sexy all the time so I went with it and replied “youu do”. He immediately gave me a weird look. That’s when I realized that he said “you look so sexy with a dick in your mouth”.

dlgde5,TIFU by accidentally submitting a suicide note as my essay for English class,28347,0.87,992,2019-10-22 16:39:44,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dlgde5/tifu_by_accidentally_submitting_a_suicide_note_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dlgde5/tifu_by_accidentally_submitting_a_suicide_note_as/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,,False,"so this happened yesterday, and I've yet to see what the results of my stupidity are

It is important to know that I was suicidal a year or so ago. I still have depression and anxiety though. Also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.

So for my English class, I required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. I decided to do the ""3 stages of life"" one, but instead of the classic ""Birth, life, and death"" stages, I made the stages of my life ""Bliss, Pain, Unknown.""  For Bliss I wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. For pain, I write about how depressed I got during high school and how I wake up everyday and think about how badly I want to die. Then for Unknown, I wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after I die. I said I was looking forward to my death too. Once I finished, I submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because I was right up against the deadline for submission

So fast forward to me, in my English class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to ""peer review"" each other's essays. I read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. The people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (I never said I would kill myself, and I have no intention of doing so, but I did say in the essay that I was looking forward to dying, and I guess that made them think imma kill myself)

So now im just sitting there thinking to myself ""shit I just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone""

So now im pretty sure that my teacher's gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents

&#x200B;

TLDR; I accidentally wrote a suicide note and turned it in for my English essay assignment, and I had to read it out loud in front of a few of my classmates.

Edit: y’all thanks for all the support, I really appreciate it! I’m at school right now but when I get home I’ll read all your comments.

Edit 2: again, thanks for y’all’s support it means a lot to me. Also, thank you to those who showed me that LongBeachGriffy video that really made me smile a little bit. If anything interesting happens regarding this story, I’ll be sure to update yall

update: nothing interesting happened. my teacher handed the assignment back and she wrote just a generic “hang in there it gets better” message"

I am from Hungary and she is from Slovakia. We communicate in English, but naturally we have begun slowly learning each other’s languge. As I learn more and more words and phrases, I like to put what I know already to use and speak to her family in Slovak whenever I can (they speak English as well, so I don’t *have* to do this).

When I learned that ‘na obed’ is their equivalent of ‘for lunch’, I was making a lot of stupid jokes by prepending random words that I know to this construct. I mostly made this ‘jokes’ to her and her sister. However, this one time I saw her mother preparing some seeds for the birds they keep in the living room. Having previously learned that ‘bird’ is ‘ftak’ in Slovak, I thought this was a perfect opportunity for me to present my knowledge of the language.

So I asked her, smiling: ‘Obed na ftak?’

Then this genius idea crossed my mind to make a stupid joke: ‘…or ftak na obed?’

My gf’s older sister burst out in hysterical laughter, shortly followed by her mother.

It would have been good for me to know that ‘ftak’ is also common slang for ‘penis’, meaning I have basically enquired if she would like ‘dick for lunch’. Her mother and sister periodically remind me of the story by proposin ftak for lunch when discussing ideas for the next day…

TL; DR:
I showed off my knowledge of my gf’s language to her family by proposing we have dicks for lunch."

No biggie, but it meant I had to borrow my dads truck to go to work today. Now my dad has a newer pickup with a Bluetooth radio, so I synched my phone up, put on some music and went to work. 

Later, once I went home I decided to have some “me” time and watch some “special video’s”. Around the 4th video when I was really getting into it, the audio suddenly cut off. Puzzled, it took me a few seconds to realized the horror of what had happened.... My dad turned his truck on to go check the mail and was greeted with a full volume, near orgasm, porn moan when he did. 

When he got home, I was standing in the kitchen and awkwardly made eye contact with him and died a little inside. All he said was “what the fuck son”. 

TL:DR- I borrowed my dads truck and synched my phone to it. Went home and watched porn and my dad was greeted with the sound of a moaning porn-star when he started his truck

I have also been writing a lot of TikTok comments so I guess the shortening stuck even here. 🤦🏻‍♀️I fixed it up a bit. I didn't expect anyone to see this to be honest. 

So my mom called me the other day and said that she is gonna go get divorce papers and I was so happy for her. Her husband is a horribly jealous douche bag and the marriage has been falling apart for years and eventhough she isn't a great person either it really sucks to see her so unhappy.

I am really exited so I call my friend who I have been talking about this before and start the phone call by saying ""Guess who's getting divorce papers tomorrow!"". There's a really awkward silence and I have no idea why. My friend doesn't say anything and after a while is like: ""are u ok?"". I am so confused at this point. Until I realize. Wait.. I am married. SHE THINKS THAT I AM GETTING A DIVORCE? HOLY SHIT.

I scramble to explain myself and everything is fine now but I am absolutely mortified. I gave my friend a heart attack for no reason. 🤦🏻

TL;DR:
I forgot I was married and made my friend think me and my husband are getting divorced by wording things badly."
k5augn,TIFU by going too far with my superpower,28277,0.93,1123,2020-12-02 20:35:16,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k5augn/tifu_by_going_too_far_with_my_superpower/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/k5augn/tifu_by_going_too_far_with_my_superpower/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Technically, yesterday I fucked up and today I am abundantly aware.

I'm in quarantine after testing positive, and my mother currently lives with me, so I'm confined to a single 7'x9' room in my apartment. Needless to say, I'm running out of ways to occupy my time pretty quickly. Well, yesterday it happened; I lost all smell and taste. Weird, but at least it gave me something to do! I promptly drank black coffee, then moved on to greater challenges and ate an entire black licorice candy (anise is the devil's flavor) with no effect. Then I had an idea! What about spicy food?

Now, I'm definitely really white, but I'm not 'jalapeños in chili is too spicy' white. So I hopped online and went to my favorite Thai restaurant. I figure this'll be a 'last hurrah' of sorts after I use my new superpower to kickstart the second half of my diet. For their green curry, they had a spice scale of low, medium, adventurous, and native Thai. While I did briefly consider 'native Thai,' logic got the better of me and I went with 'adventurous.'

It was the weirdest experience ever. My entire body was sweating - my *eyeballs* were sweating. I could tell it was spicy and tell it was painful, but in this weird removed way where it didn't really matter. I also couldn't taste a damn thing. The only sensation I had was this sort of numb physical pain and a small voice saying, ""I think pain means you're supposed to stop?"" At this point, my edible kicked in, and I've been locked in a single room for five days with five more to go and this is by far the most exciting thing I had going on, so I doubled down. Ate the whole damn thing, amazed the entire time at my new abilities.

Here we are the day after, and my delicate New England tummy is paying for yesterday's ego trip. My apartment only has one bathroom, and I have to coordinate trips with my mother so as not to put her at greater risk. I flew too close to the sun, folks.

TL;DR lost sense of taste from Rona, got bored and high, ate crazy spicy Thai food, now everything hurts.

Edit: thank you for the awards! And for reminding me that I can’t taste any pie right now. Not even Thanksgiving pie.

Second edit because some people don’t have good reading comprehension: not only did I get delivery (hence going online) but my mother (tested negative) is the one who picked it up from my building foyer and brought it to my door where I, while wearing a mask, picked it up and brought it inside my room because I’m *quarantined in one single room in my apartment for 10 days.*

Another edit: guys, this is nuts! My most popular posts are of my cat and I get crazy excited when he gets, like, 2k likes (my baby is a star!). Thank you for reading and I’m glad so many people got a chuckle! I did not think as far ahead as I should have when I planned my experiment, but you all have been super nice and helped me kill quite a bit of time! 

And if anyone wants information on CDC recommendations and requirements for quarantining following a positive test, please contact them. That’s what I did and have been following what they directly told me to do. If you have questions, they’re a great resource! I left a message to self-report my results and they called me back a couple days after."

I'm still trying to process....and to not pee my pants.

My husband went outside to put out the trash, since its midnight he wore a head lamp. He comes back inside looking a little pale but also like he found something really cool. 

Turns out he read somewhere on reddit that you can see a spider's eye shine in the grass. He told me about it and said it was interesting. 

Now here's the fuck up. I asked him to show me.  I should probably mention that I have arachnophobia. Like legit pee my pants, cry, throw my kids out of my way while I run for my life arachnophobia. I thought I could handle it. I thought it would be one sparkly reflection. I thought it would be ok cuz I wouldn't actually *see* a spider. 

I was wrong.

So very very *very* wrong. There had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. I'm not sure how I made it back in the house but I was told screaming was involved. Now I'm terrified of leaving my house. 

TLDR spiders. Arachnophobia.  Never leaving my house again.

Hokywowbatman now I know what RIP my inbox means. I never thought this post would get any views. So.....

1. Thank you everyone for the advice on getting therapy, I will definitely follow up on it. I do not want to live this way.

2. Phobia is an *irrational* fear. If I could ""grow the fuck up"" and ""get over it"" and ""stop being such a baby"" and all the other unhelpful comments that were sent to me, believe me I would. Who wants to be scared of a thing that is teeny tiny compared to you.

a2gfsg,TIFU by being so pregnant I couldn’t see what I was wearing before I went on stage,28267,0.86,581,2018-12-03 01:10:34,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2gfsg/tifu_by_being_so_pregnant_i_couldnt_see_what_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2gfsg/tifu_by_being_so_pregnant_i_couldnt_see_what_i/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This just happened a couple of hours ago. I am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. So I am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special Christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. I also had to sing a solo before the message, which I was *very* nervous for. 

I picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. I even painted my nails to match. 

The first service went smoothly... but when I got home, I noticed I had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *Great*, that’s probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. So I was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. I took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. I also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so I wouldn’t sweat next time.

Before I knew it, I was running a bit behind, so I put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. I got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. Someone asked if it was too windy for me. We’re in South Florida, so I had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. 

Unfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. I grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. Everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which I figured was due to my tardiness.

We started with a hymn... That’s when I realized I felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress I was wearing. I worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. I could not see past my belly easily, so I leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...

The sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. There they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. Still on my legs. And the whole audience sees them. How the freak did I not notice, and how did I get on stage without anyone telling me?!? 

I rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. I couldn’t even run off afterwards and hide, because I had to sing a solo immediately after that! On the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...

TLDR: Changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. Unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because I’m huge and can’t see my legs. "

**Edit: this has been shadow removed and I was given no notice. Cool, thanks mods. Fuck you too. I broke 0 rules.**

**Edit; it’s back up. Weird. Sorry I cussed at you, mods. Twas rude of me** 


So, my brother is an officer and recently told me a story about a naked homeless man breaking into someone’s home and taking a nap on their couch. So obviously the first thing that came to mind was to hide in his attic fully nude and wait for him to get home so I could give him a good scare. 

It took a lot longer than I expected and I live in Texas so attics are exactly a comfortable place to hangout. After about 30 minutes I decided it was an awful idea to continue and a safe idea to go get some water and clothes. 

On my way down the attic stairs I heard a loud scream. It was his girlfriend who I never heard get home. She said all she saw was bare ass and thought it was a homeless man like my brother had just encountered. Not wanting to get shot, I immediately started yelling her name and identifying myself. She slapped me a few times and told me to leave. My brother wasn’t too happy but couldn’t hide a smirk as he told me I’m an idiot and lucky nothing bad happened (which is true). 
So now there’s a rule against me having keys to anybody’s house. (This happened 2 days ago.). 

TL;DR; tried to sneak attack my brother from above but instead scarred his girlfriend for life.

Edit: I’ve had fun with you guys, thanks for all the responses. Disabling replies now; can’t keep up and getting the “fuck your brother” comments isn’t fun so I’ll just shush. Rather not have politics in the thread but I did it to myself the second I said cop, so feel free to discuss but keep it civil so it’ll hopefully be conversation and not just arguing. Take care everyone!

 (Black lives matter. Police brutality exists. China fucking sucks. Donald is a terrible president. Etc etc. we all agree on most of these things. Loving my brother is not wrong, so bitch at me all you want. You’re not helping anything by talking shit on a reddit thread though)"
7jbzcf,TIFU by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house,28226,0.91,1626,2017-12-12 22:20:11,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7jbzcf/tifu_by_allowing_my_husband_to_come_to_dinner_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7jbzcf/tifu_by_allowing_my_husband_to_come_to_dinner_at/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"This actually took place a couple of years ago.

I had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

Well, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. 

By the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded ""Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. 

Well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

I had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

My boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

I look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

Now my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he's not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he's thinking. There' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

In this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

I couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn't have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

It suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

I could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

My boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

He finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

He makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

We all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

As soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

Turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

A year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.

TL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. Yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**Edit 2:** No my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although I get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. The usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. If he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. This, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  Not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when I feel like I was making the exact opposite point. Oh well. Glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  Also, we all have our faults. I joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc."

I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&#x200B;

Then, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don’t remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don’t want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I’d be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.

&#x200B;

She was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said “what are the fucking odds.” We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.

&#x200B;

I got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* When did i learn i could do this?
* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* Are you bi? Do you think it’s kind of gay?

&#x200B;

I obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&#x200B;

I asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn’t the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&#x200B;

I really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don’t think I want to know the answer.

&#x200B;

So there you have it.

&#x200B;

Oh and no, I do not know if she’s on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&#x200B;

tl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it’s awkward but it’ll all be okay.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Okay, I'll answer the questions.

I learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&#x200B;

Never done it for a crowd before, no.

&#x200B;

(from the original post)

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts. No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that's for sure.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:  Guys, ""party trick"" is just a saying.   This is the only party I have ever done this.

&#x200B;

EDIT 3:  No, there are no videos or photos.  But if you live in LA I might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward."
cpkprt,TIFU by accidentally taking my boyfriend on his nightmare date.,28187,0.93,1607,2019-08-13 05:16:13,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cpkprt/tifu_by_accidentally_taking_my_boyfriend_on_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cpkprt/tifu_by_accidentally_taking_my_boyfriend_on_his/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.

My ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. He took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an Obon Festival, a special old school Star Trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! For his birthday, I resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. We had been together for \~10 months at that point, so I thought I knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. [(Not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it's like)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeMo5o46rso)

I had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and I loved it soooooo much. It was special to me and I was so excited to share it with him.

He was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. I kept hyping him up, saying ""I can't wait until the final surprise, I hope you love it! You're going to love it!""

We got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and I led him in Belle-at-the-library-in-Beauty-&-the-Beast style. I still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. Finally, the moment of truth: I took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.

Immediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.

He was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.

""Umm... are you OK, dear?""

""I'm.... fine..."" he said with a classic Hide the Pain Harold grimace.

""You don't seem fine. Did something happen?""

He looked ill and muttered ""why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them"". I must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. Before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting ""OH GOD, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR."" Before I could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling ""wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!"" It was chaos. Kids were watching him from their strollers. Some were screaming and crying. 

When I finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. I apologized profusely and he said it wasn't my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn't come up in conversation yet. I couldn't have known.

We just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, ""Let's just go home."" 

It took me months before I felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, I managed to screw that up too. (it's the Nightmare Redux: Thai Surprise in the comments)

TL;DR: I accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. 

EDIT: Sorry, I accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. Dang. I hope I cobbled it back together properly. 

1. Please don't be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. It's not his fault. 
2. I was really dumb and young in this story and I don't try to surprise people anymore (unless it's something they explicitly said they wanted). I thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre Fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. 

He did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn't destroyed completely."

I have read some crazy ass stories on here so, uh, it's hard to tell if this post will even come close to the standard of this sub.** 

*Shrug*

**S'up.**

This happened last weekend. 

I went to my friend's house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. I thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. So, I eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. Oof. It was freeing. The penis was a swingin' and the balls was a breathin'. Pure cock flopping fun I tell thee. And so... off I go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. 

Cut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. Her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** Aw, fuuuck! It's gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. I literally spin her ass around so it doesn't touch my dick no more. Worst. Fucking. Mistake. This girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. As if that wasn't bad enough, my dick *fucking flexes* right before I cover up. Folks there lost their shit. Dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls & whistles, all erupted in that moment. I questioned so many life choices as I stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. 

For the rest of that night I had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. The motherfuckers called it the Panda Challenge.

*Edit: Thanks for the Platinum, Silver & Gold, kind souls!*

*TL;DR I went commando and ended up partying so hard my penis popped out and joined the fun in front of everyone.*"
vybvjv,TIFU Asking my Tinder date to choke me.,28164,0.84,2455,2022-07-14 01:08:55,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vybvjv/tifu_asking_my_tinder_date_to_choke_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vybvjv/tifu_asking_my_tinder_date_to_choke_me/,self.tifu,0,7,,text,True,False,False,"(This Happened a few weeks back, only posting now since the condition has finally cleared up.)


I've just recently started getting back into the dating scene. Met up with a guy from tinder that I'd been chatting with for a few days for drinks. Things were going very well, there were no awkward gaps in conversation, we were both into alot the same things, he was really funny, and it didn't hurt that he was also super fucking hot and in shape.


Maybe 2ish hours in he asked me if I had any plans afterwards. When I told him I was probably just gonna go home and watch Kenobi, he asked if I ""wanted someone company"" while I did. I said fuck yeah and we headed back to my place, where needless to say we did not end up watching Kenobi, or at least not very much if it before we dropped the pretense, started mashing lips together, and clothes started flying off.


Something to note about me is that I love roughness and love getting manhandled. I understand that's not for everyone, but that's what I like. This guy was very sweet, and very gentle with me, but at this point I'm very much into it and trying to get him to go harder. Spank me, pull my hair, etc. Finally he's got me prone from behind and I'm calling out for him to choke me, since I know it'll drive me over the edge. He's very reluctant, but eventually relents.


I had expected him to just use one hand on my neck, but he ended up using his whole arm, kind of like how they do in ufc fights. It was very tight, but he was putting almost no pressure on it, so I could still breathe relatively normally. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's the best way I can think to describe it. Wanting it to be tighter I kind of teased him by saying ""C'mon don't be a pussy"" trying to be sexy but also letting him know to choke me harder. He obliged, and it was the tightest I've ever been choked. I could feel my whole body shaking as I started to orgasm, the next thing I knew I was jolting awake and gasping for air.


It's not the first time I've passed out from being choked, but this guy was urgently trying to get me dressed and to a hospital. I thought he was overreacting until he got me in front of a mirror and I saw that one of my eyes was filled with blood. Like imagine all the parts of your eye that are white are all just blood red. It didn't hurt, but needless to say it freaked me out pretty badly.


To wrap up this overly long story, I spent about 4-5 hours awkwardly explaining what happened to multiple nurses and hospital staff, explaining that I had asked him to do it and that he wasn't abusing me. Which I imagine was hard to believe given the appearance of my eye and the bruise starting to form around my neck. Long story short, the doctor let me know I had popped a blood vessel in my eye, and that while it looked bad, it was most likely superficial and would clear up in a few weeks.


He ended up driving me home, but ended up not responding to any of my calls or texts the following day. Found out he ended up unmatching me on tinder as well. So yeah, pretty sure I traumatized him and blew that opportunity at a relationship.


TL;DR: Ended up asking my tinder date to choke me, ended up passing out and popping a blood vessel in my eye, had to explain that I'm just a kinky weirdo to hospital staff, and likely traumatized my date to the point he wants nothing to do with me.

Edit: Just wanted to take a moment to update this post and clear up some things. 

1. I completely acknowledge that this situation was 100% my fault and I really do feel awful about what happened, but there's not a whole lot I can do.

2. I had already reached out to try to make amends the day after the incident happened. As much as I would love to properly apologize in person for everything that happened, it's clear that he dosen't want to speak to me, so I'm going to respect his wishes on that.

3. No, I'm not ""going to therapy"" because I have a kink and got caught up in the moment because I was horny, or for any other contrived reason you come up with .

4. Please stop assuming I'm super into BDSM I'm really not. I just enjoy a little roughness and bring choked. I do appreciate the people giving solid advice though.

5. He might have been reluctant to choke me, but he was still very much a willing participant. You can call it victim blaming or whatever, but some of you are very cavalier with your use of the word rape and sexual assault. 

Will update if I think of anything else."

&#x200B;

I started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It's a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.

&#x200B;

Btw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She's thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That's significant.

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.

&#x200B;

tl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you to everyone on the ""real world"" advice. It does suck, but that's the way it goes, I suppose. My boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. He firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. He made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they DO NOT want to lose me as an employee. Apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn't happen. They are going to merge me into another area so I can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.  "

I woke up feeling terrible from allergies - I could hardly hold my eyes open and decided it would be best to stay home from work, so I opened up my laptop and began writing an email to my coworkers and managers. I quickly wrote up a message and sent it off to the roughly 40 people who needed to know I wouldn’t be in, closed down my laptop and went back to bed. A few hours later I checked my email to see if there were any important messages, and that’s when I discovered what I had done - a very unfortunate typo. In the subject line of the email, I wrote “Dick Day” instead of “Sick Day”. I was so embarrassed I contemplated taking another sick day the day after, just to avoid facing everyone. For the next year I suffered through endless jokes from my coworkers about that time I took sick time to jack off all day. It would be pretty funny if it wasn’t so humiliating lmao. to this day (a few years later) I’m still extremely cautious double checking the subject line on my sick day emails. 

TLDR: Took a sick day, wrote “Dick Day” in the subject line of my email to dozens of coworkers, managers, and my boss.

Edit: To anyone concerned that this is still keeping me up at night… don’t worry, it’s not. I returned to work the next day and laughed it off. I cringe a little when I remember this, but also find it super funny and tell people about it all the time"

Sometimes when I’m alone, I do goofy things with my voice. Exaggerated impressions, thick accents, general squealing, you name it. I live with family, so alone time where I can make noise carelessly isn’t common. 

Well, one of the noises I make happens to be an exaggerated “oh fuck!”, a la that of a porn actress. It always makes me laugh because I’m an idiot like that, and I do it only once in a while, when the thought occurs and the place is empty.  

Now we have very thin floors—so thin that if people are talking above you, you can clearly make out the conversation. This is important for later. 

Today I was in my basement doing laundry, I dropped some clothes and exclaimed, “Oh fuck!” And of course, my brain instantly clicked, and I did that exaggerated, “Oh FUCK!” of a porn actress. 

Now I didn’t just say “oh fuck”...no, I yelled it. I yelled it like I was a real estate agent getting DP’d in the kitchen of her open house. 

This happened to happen right after my mom came home through the back door, directly above me. I hadn’t noticed as I had been talking to myself. Only in the silence of my forbidden impression did I hear the familiar foot steps above me. 

I still haven’t gone upstairs. I’m not sure I ever will again.

TL;DR: While in the basement, I imitated that distinct “oh FUCK!” of a porn actress right when my mom came through the back door, right above me. We have very, very thin floors.

EDIT: Wow, I did not anticipate this much of a response! Thank you all for sharing amusing stories and all the rewards—if only this wasn’t my throwaway. It makes me happy that so many people were able to laugh at my FU. 

For those asking for an update, I’m afraid it’s not all that entertaining—I did escape the basement, only after my mom went upstairs. Besides that it was a fairly uneventful night, thankfully. 

For those asking to hear this impression...I’m not quite at the point of sharing that yet, sorry! If you’re really that curious, go watch some porn and you’ll likely hear something that’s pretty similar."

Might as well whore some Reddit karma while my dick stops bleeding. 

So this started a few months ago. I noticed a small red bump at the base of my penis, no way it was an STD related thing. Haha virgin Redditor. and I never let it touch public toilets. Also was at the top  left of the base

Anyway I noticed it and thought it was a weird thing that just happens and left it alone. Fast forward a couple months and it's getting bigger, I employed my normal strategy of ""nah it's fine"" however a couple of days ago I noticed it's big and red. I looked it up and found out penis pimples or ingrown hairs are not uncommon, but this thing was big. If this sized pimple was on my face I would have popped it a long time ago. But this was more sensitive. 

I finally resolved to pop this fucker, it hadn't gone away for months and it clearly wasn't going to now. I was ready for the whole shebang, shave to make it easier, find a needle and sterilize it under a flame, have a box of tissue in hand, etc. 

If only that had happened... As I was thinking of where to find a needle in my house I had to take a shit. So I do and then the thing fucking pops while I'm looking at it. I was actually a bit relieved that pus came out so I could be sure it was a pimple. But after I got the white pus out and it was blood, I realized it was still pretty big. I push onward and kept squeezing, after another layer of blood came out there was ANOTHER layer of pus. THEN an ingrown hair.

What penis God did I piss off to deserve this??

It was still pretty big so I kept squeezing and a fucking third (albeit smaller) layer of pus came out. I kept squeezing even though it was pretty small and it was just blood coming out. The bleeding stopped quickly and it didn't hurt that bad somehow, I'm now waiting to see if it will go away. If not I'm going to a doctor. Also not going to fap for a few days, don't want want to reopen the wound and become a bloody wanker. 

TL;DR penis bump turned out to be a triple pimple and an ingrown hair, had to popped it before any prep work could be done. Hopefully not infected.

EDIT: Thanks for the awards lol. The bump has gotten smaller and I'm still applying Neosporin regularly, thanks for the tips y'all"

Obligatory this happened during midterms in October. I just haven’t had a chance to write about it until now.

This is going to be a long one, but I feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).

I’m a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. To put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one I’m enrolled in is a one-year program. So right of the bat, I’m completing two years’ worth of coursework in one. Secondly, I’m now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. I always thought I had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what I’m used to, and I still question all the time whether I’m actually good enough to be here. Thirdly, I’m not so great at handling stress. I am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but I’m not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. And since that’s all I can afford right now with my insurance, that’s the best I can get.

Bottom line: I’m stressed out all the time. And midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. Now, three of those papers weren’t so bad. They took a while to write, but at least I knew what I was writing. Paper number four, however… Guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. This paper fucked me like I’ve never been fucked in my whole life. And I’m in an English-related field, so believe me, I am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. I won’t bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (To be fair, we had from mid-August to mid-October to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) Now, if I were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, I’d end up with a dissertation. In the limited space I have, I can’t fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when I tell you it was *hard*. Yes, even though I’d spoken to the professor about it a few times. And it was worth about a third of my grade.

Anyway, this big bastard was due on a Monday, so I brought myself to the library on Friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. I tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, I *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). Now, at this point, it’s not that I was losing willpower or energy. No: the problem was that I was freaking out. I wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *You’re going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck…* You get the idea. And then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; I *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely even hold my pen. My neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. And then.

And *then*.

I’ve Googled this and haven’t really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. But I’ll recount the sensation as I experienced it. All of a sudden, I felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. I can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. My entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs… and lady bits. There I was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.

I came before I even knew what was happening. It wasn’t some screaming, thrashing affair, but I did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. And yes, people *definitely* noticed; I was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. I don’t think I was obvious enough that anyone would conclude I’d just had an orgasm in the library, but still… clearly *something* had happened. I packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.

As I said, I haven’t really found a thorough explanation for this (though I haven’t been searching too intensely). I have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. Mostly, though, I’ve been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. For my part in this research, I state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.

Also, I got a 78 on the paper. But my professor assures me it won’t end up tanking my grade.

TL;DR: I got so stressed that I came involuntarily in my university library. Also, I may have masochistic tendencies and don’t know who I am anymore.

EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.

I'd just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: I did not procrastinate on this assignment. I completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. Given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time I could give myself to do it. The paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because I was so confused and stressed out. Normally I never put off things until the last minute. It just sort of happened this time because I had no idea what I was doing.

Secondly, I am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. I recently told my therapist that I'd like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance.

So… I have considered getting a doll before because ya know… it’s tits and ass on demand. I justified it by saying it’ll save me time from having to go out and get girls IRL blah blah. And also I kinda thought it’d provide some company while I’m home alone lol. 

I was looking at these $3,000 dolls and almost made the purchase but found a cheaper one for just around $1k. I couldn’t justify spending $3k knowing that there would be a high chance I’d regret it.

It came in a big box, I hauled it into my bedroom, it ways about 30kg.. I underestimated just how much that weighs. So I sliced open the box and started removing the packaging and I could see it’s little fucking toes poking out and I was like… oh shit… here we go. Kept removing the packaging and of course I grabbed the tits as soon as I saw them. They’re okay, but nothing like the real thing ofc. 

I pulled the cold corpse of a doll out of its box… it didn’t have its head screwed on.. so I unwrapped the head, plonked that on.. and it’s a half decent looking thing. Better than I was expecting tbh. I wasted no time sticking the electric warming stick up it’s pussy, waited a few minutes, dumped it on the bed and.. well, we had a play. 

Ngl… it’s better than a hand or pocket pussy but believe me, once you “finish”… you now have to wrestle it’s cold body, clean what needs to be cleaned (in this case I unscrewed it’s head and basically force fed it water in the sink lol). I hadn’t yet thought… where tf do I store this thing. It’s about 160cm tall… so I plonked it in my closet on a cabinet wrapped it in a blanket and Jesus Christ.. it looks like a corpse.. literally. I now have to walk in there every day to be greeted by a cold wrapped up corpse when I need to grab some clothes. The heck do I do with it, it’s corpse or bye bye $1k. 

tl;dr: If you aren’t actually THAT lonely and only getting a sex doll “out of curiosity”, there is a very big chance you’ll regret it."

How could it go wrong? Parents caught us having sex? Parents caught us in the middle of something that looks extremely awkward from the outside, like a weird game? No, god no. If a god is out there, clearly I haven't prayed enough because holy fuck. The things I'd do to take this back.

To preface this, me and my mom are quite close. We talk a lot about topics most people can't with their parents from masturbation to marriage issues. My girlfriend knows I'm quite open about a lot of stuff, like the fact that I watch hentai and jerk off almost excessively. Yes, you can reach this level of openness with your parents. I'm not anywhere near as close with my dad, but my mom (and some younger siblings, who cares) was the only person home at the time. What my girlfriend didnt know is that me and my mom do not under any circumstances discuss our kinks or fetishes. My girlfriend did however know I like to crossdress(among some other stuff.)

So my mom picks us up, gf and mom meet eachother and talk about some stuff. They're just casually chatting and then my mom makes a joke about me having panties in my drawer. I shrug it off with some comments about how I do you know, adding to the joke. We are laughing then my girlfriend starts saying ""Well uhm yeah you know how he um... yeah does that and stuff"" and variations of it for what felt like the longest 5 or so seconds of my life. I would love to see the look on my face as she basically told my OWN MOTHER that I crossdress for sexual pleasure. She didn't explicitly say, but it was heavily implied by context, and the fact that I instantly started panicking, the look on my face and body language would have given it away. My mom is a smart person, and she definitely would've known.

TLDR; Invited gf to house, she told my mom I wear panties sometimes."

We got a cat a couple of months ago that we're basically obsessed with. He is not tall (it's not his fault!).

A few weeks ago we started cracking the windows because the landlord turned the heat on and it's hot AF. This led to the occasional insect coming inside to chill on our ceiling. It drove the cat nuts.

So we started lifting the cat to the ceiling to ""hunt"" because we love him dearly and because it was funny as shit. Cat is happy, we're amused. The only loser here is the fly that picked the wrong apartment. Wrong.

Fast forward to today. The cat now considers the ceiling his hunting grounds and will spend an inordinate amount of time staring at the empty ceiling and crying for prey. Can't help ya, bud. Please stop crying?

TL:DR I gave my cat a taste of the high life now he's down in the dumps.

Edit the third: An awful lot of you have never heard of steam heat. Pre-war buildings tend not to have central air so heat is supplied via steam pipes and radiators using a furnace in the basement.  In especially shitty hipster apartments the radiator is either off or on. Guess what type of apartment I live in."
j4wrvq,TIFU by begging a bar tender for nothing,28031,0.94,733,2020-10-04 15:52:40,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j4wrvq/tifu_by_begging_a_bar_tender_for_nothing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j4wrvq/tifu_by_begging_a_bar_tender_for_nothing/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So this story happened about a year ago, and requires some cultural context. In Ireland, there’s been a recent resurgence in the Irish language, and a lot of movement to promote Irish speaking throughout the countries. This resulted in an Irish speaking bar being opened in Dublin. 

I didn’t grow up in Ireland, so I don’t speak a word of Irish- but my best friend was begging me to go with her to this bar. I relented, but told her it was up to her to get me into the bar and order at the bar for us so I didn’t get in trouble for not speaking Irish. She agreed happily and we headed out that night. 

So we get to the bar, and she tells me when it’s our turn to speak to the bouncer, just say “dia dhuit”, which means hello, and she’ll chat away to distract him. Our plan goes off without a hitch, and we’re in! I turn, ready to ask my friend to order me a drink, to find her lost in the eyes of a boy she’d met a few nights previously. Not wanting to get in her way, I just gently shook her shoulder, and we have a conversation as follows. 

Me: “Hey, how do I ask for an Orchard Thieves in Irish?” 

Friend: “Oh, uh, Orchard Thieves... le do thoil”

I nod and leave her to it, and make my way determinedly to the bar. The bar man comes over and says something in Irish I can’t understand, so I panic, and just shout out my order. 

“Le do thoil!”

The barman returns a blank look. I take this as him not having understood me, and decide I need to be more clear. 

“LE. DO. THOIL.”

The bar man cocks his head, and says something that I again, don’t understand. Now fully panicking, I decide to just keep repeating myself in different inflections until he gets me. 

“Le DO Thoil? LE Do Thoil? Le Do THOIL?”

Eventually the barman interrupts me. 

“Jesus Christ girl just speak English. What do you want?!” 

“Just an Orchard Thieves!”

The bar man walks away, muttering, “Why didn’t you just say so?” 

Embarrassed my friend had put me in this position, I marched up to her and yanked her off the boy who she’d been chatting up. 

“What did you tell me to say?” I demand. 

“Huh? I told you how to say Orchard Thieves please?”

“Yeah well, clearly the way you say it is wrong, because the barman had no idea what I was saying.”

My friend looks at me suspiciously. “Pzych, what did you say, exactly?”

“I said le do thoil. And I said it a bunch of ways as well, so there’s no way I got the pronunciation wrong.”

“Wait,” my friend responds. “You said JUST le do thoil?”

“Yeah!” I replied, indignant. “That’s what you told me to say!”

“No, I told you to say Orchard Thieves le do thoil! Le do thoil means please you eejit!”

And then it dawned on me. Of course you don’t translate Orchard Thieves- it’s a brand name! So that meant that I was just repeating, in varying tones and levels of panic, “please please please” to this poor bar tender. 

I am, indeed, an eejit. 

TL;DR: I misunderstood how to ask for a drink in Irish, and ended up just repeating “please” to the poor bartender with varying levels of panic.

Edit: for all those people trying to correct me to say it’s meant to be [Gaelic](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.unitedlanguagegroup.com/blog/gaelic-vs-irish-whats-the-difference%3Fhs_amp%3Dtrue)"

So for starters, I’m not a good singer AT ALL, I’m the kind of person that gets last place at karaoke games every single time. I do love singing tho, especially when I think I’m alone. 

Currently I am staying in Croatia and there’s a small town nearby with a tiny tiny church. Me and my girlfriend went inside and there were amazing acoustics inside. (The type where you can sing great operas or horror movie soundtracks) 

I decided to firstly sing the Halo theme song and it sounded great. 

We went outside and decided to grab a drink before leaving the town, but on our way out we walked past the church again. I begged me gf to go inside again so I could sing a song from the Hobbit (misty mountains) and decided to record it. My girlfriend was embarrassed and decided to stay outside whilst I sang at almost the loudest I could and I think it sounded amazing. (I haven’t listened to the recording because I’m too scared to). 

After I finished the song I went outside of the door and at that moment I noticed that the church was across the street from a restaurant. A restaurant filled with probably 50/60 tourists just STARING at me. 

All. Of. Them. 

My girlfriend was standing around the corner with the biggest grin ever saying that a lot of people were recording and laughing at it. 

Me being a person with incredible anxiety issues (yay for therapy) decided that the best option was to just... run away. Not looking back a single time. 

It was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life and it gives me shivers everytime I think back. 

TL;DR found a church with amazing acoustics where I decided to sing a song from the Hobbit, but accidentally sang for a lot of people that were across the street.

All classes are being delivered online due to the pandemic and as such we log into Microsoft teams to participate in our lessons.

I logged in this morning for a group tutorial, all was well. Then I had a 30 minute break before my next class. Statistics this time round. In this 30 minute break my gf decided we should participate in some extra curricular activities if you know what I mean. So wham bam we got it on. Time was against us and whilst I managed to achieve the intended result she was somewhat lacking. Had time been on my side, and I was a better lover, I would have facilitated the equal achievement for my partner. However as previously stated I was required to study some statistics.

The lecture started and my partner continued next to me in the bed while I some what distracted tried to continue my studies. She achieved a spectacular orgasm with the full on porn sound effects, fantastic.

My lecturer tried to stifle a laugh. Then to my horror I saw I was not muted. Fuck. I think it was unmuted when I made the teams window fullscreen.

We valiantly carried on as if nothing had happened and my WhatsApp group exploded with comments. This has gone well.

On the bright side the lecture is recorded so I can relive my moment of shame at my leisure. Fuck stats.

TL:DR

Managed to unmute my mic whilst my partner orgasmed loudly next to me. In an online class.

Edit: I have reviewed the class. Whilst it's hilarious I cannot post the video, or audio, without seriously breaching the uni social media policies. You can clearly hear other students and the lecturer's voices and its not on to broadcast that. I have broadcast quite enough."

This story begins three days ago and concluded yesterday morning.

This is the most exciting shit that has happened to me in weeks, people. 

I have, despite loving the outdoors, never been stung by a wasp, bee, etc. I have no problems with insects, hell I’ll pick up a spider, but the pointy asses I’m not a fan of (bees are cool though). 

So I wake up and head to the bathroom to take my morning shit, I open the door and hear buzzing and notice Satan himself has decided to pay me a visit and is flying about my shower curtains. 

I immediately noped out of there and begin brainstorming how to kill this bastard. 

I had determined that the point of entry was my window as it was slightly ajar, I seal the weak point and prepare to suit up. 

I then spend the next 20 minutes putting on multiple layers of clothing, 2 pairs of socks going on top of my pants, 2 sweatshirts, sweatpants, a shirt around my head and face “turban” style, a beanie, winter gloves...you get the point. I was impenetrable save the slit where my eyes were. I grab “The Executioner” which is a glorified electric tennis racket and was ready for war. 

I slowly open the door to do some recon and see that little jerk was chilling on the ceiling vent. Close the door, grab The Executioner, take a deep breath and reopen the door. 

The enemy has since taken up a more tactical position behind the lights above my sink...clever. It turns to face me and opens its wings up, ready to kamikaze my ass at a moment’s notice. It can smell fear, and probably the gallons of sweat I’m excreting from being in enough clothing to brave Mt. Everest. I’m fucking hot and shaking. 

Thinking on the fly (hah puns) I grab a shirt and throw it at the winged heathen to try and flush it out of it’s position- success! Or so I thought. 

It tumbled down for a moment before regaining control and I shit you not made a beeline (more puns) straight for me and in a panic I slam the door shut. My mom is telling me I need to close the vent in my bathroom otherwise It could get in and then the whole household would be compromised. 

Understanding the stakes I muster the courage to open the door one more time only to discover that in my haste I have lost all visual of the enemy. Gone. After closing the vent I spent the next 10 minutes, still sweating balls, clearing the bathoom looking for that little shit. Couldn’t find it. I was convinced that it made it’s way into the ventilation. 

All hands on deck. Code red. I close every vent on the second floor in every room and the vents in the hallway. I meticulously check my bathoom once again, under the sink, between the shower curtains, trash can, nothing. There’s nothing more I can do.

I spend the next two days afraid of my own fucking bathroom, carrying The Executioner with me like Jesse Pinkman and his pistol in El Camino. It must be in the vents, and so there it shall die.

I awake yesterday morning to take my morning shit, the first time that I didn’t take The Executioner with me and when I exit to go lie down in bed again I’m greeted with a familiar sound emanating from the window blinds next to my bed. Then I see it. 

That skinny waisted, stabby assed, flying fucker flew under the radar and remained in hiding for TWO DAYS until I was UNARMED and then makes a move. It was in my room. Skulking. Lurking. Waiting. I see it fly behind my bed. The Executioner is on my nightstand. I’m without armor and in nothing but briefs. 

On some wild west cowboy shit ready to draw, I make a move for The Executioner and backpedal to a central position where I can wait for it’s next move. Mano y mano, bitch. 

I wait 5 minutes before deciding that I’ve had enough. I flank around the perimeter of my room and with one hand open up my window nice and wide, hoping and praying that I didn’t just invite the whole wasp cavalry to make a grand entrance into my bedroom if it decides to release attack pheremones. 

It must’ve been behind my nightstand and felt threatened by my arm because it flew out and landed right on my forearm and before I could swipe it off and electrify that flying syringe it delivered me a painful parting gift. I freak out and trip backwards before it flew off out of my window.

Window shut. I lick my wounds. The vents are opened. The war is over, but casualties have been sustained. Honestly, that little asshole deserves to live, so long as it never returns. 

TL; DR A wasp spawns in my bathroom. I failed at killing it. It disappears and remains hidden for two days before reemerging. It takes my sting virginity and escapes and I definitely didn’t pussy out

EDIT: FUCK YOU WASP I GOT PLATINUM! A couple pics of the possible yellow jacket nest we now gotta deal with, plus my “armor” and the heathen himself: https://imgur.com/gallery/exXFOhK

Edit 2: The culprit was a single paper wasp. The nest in the first picture is a possible yellow jacket nest, entirely separate, like some fucked up level 2 on the horizon after surviving level 1."
j8zwdp,TIFU by making myself look utterly insane in a pet store,27934,0.96,479,2020-10-11 11:13:29,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j8zwdp/tifu_by_making_myself_look_utterly_insane_in_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/j8zwdp/tifu_by_making_myself_look_utterly_insane_in_a/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happened earlier today.

My partner and I stopped in at a pet store to buy food and litter for our cats. This pet store is part of a chain that works with rescue agencies in our area. Each location has an 'adoption centre' where cats who are deemed ready for adoption are kept.

Another detail: My partner has a sister whose name we shorten to ""Kat"". Kat has long volunteered for one of our local rescue agencies to foster cats, which are then brought to the various locations of the pet store chain in question. So we'll stop by the adoption centre to look at the kitties, and sometimes they look familiar. That's right: sometimes we see Kat's cats in the adoption centre. Of course, she takes care of so many at any given time that it's hard for me to keep track. But when I recognize one, I get pretty excited to see them ready to find humans of their very own.

Back to today: The pet store location we're at has the adoption centre nearer to the front of the store than most other locations, and so I went to look at the cats while my partner stood in line nearby. Then I see them. Two sister kittens who are eerily familiar; I remember one of them because of her name, and the other one because she looks like a younger version of one of our guys. I look up at my partner, and I ask VERY loudly:

""Are these Kat's? I think these are Kat's!""

I look at him, and he's just staring at me with a very concerned look on his face. Confused, I continued, a little louder:

""Seriously, I think these ones are Kat's!""

After a pause, a look of understanding comes to his eyes, and he just shakes his head. I then look at the other people in the line, who are also staring at me. Then I realized that, without the necessary context, it looked like a 30-something year-old guy who wasn't entirely sure what cats looked like, and that I was excited to maybe be able to identify them. 

I return to the line up and just silently wish for death. When we make it out of the store, my partner tells me that even he wasn't sure what I was talking about at first, and was wondering if he should bring me to a hospital, before he understood what I was trying to say.

TL;DR: I stood pointing at cats in a busy pet store, asking my partner if they were cats. Many strangers looked on in confusion.

Update: Can now confirm, they were definitely Kat's. Also, a big thank you for the awards. I've never gotten any before!"

As the resemblance was uncanny, I decided to sneak a quick photo of the person to send to my friend. When I got out of the tube and regained service on my phone, I sent them a message with the photo with the caption ""this guy looks just like you if you packed on some pounds'.

The message was opened almost immediately...

Back when I was around 9 or 10 my family bought me [these toys for Christmas](https://m.imgur.com/a/AD358JS). As the pictures suggests, you could “connect” a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.

You can probably see where this is going already... In my not-so-clever mind I wanted to see if I could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. I remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. Then with my other hand I grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **SNAP** I fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were Hulk Hogan and Goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. 

Hulk and Goldberg held their grip while I screamed in pain. I tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick I just couldn't.

To my absolute embarrassment, my Mum and Dad rushed into the room and had to pull Hulk and Goldberg from my dick.

This story is still brought up at Christmas dinners to this day.

TL;DR: Got Hulk Hogan and Goldberg action figures stuck to my dick via magnets and had to get my parents to remove them."

Every month when the power bill comes up, my roommate alerts us of in a comical manner. We've received the Star Wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the Stranger Things intro sequence, you get the idea. Well this time I get a link to a subtitled North Korean news broadcast, link [here.](http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/NORTH-KOREA-POWER-BILL) So naturally I send my roommate the money via Venmo with the subject ""North Korea is best Korea.""

Within seconds, I get a notification in the Venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by Venmo's compliance department per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. There is a 48hr hold on the payment and I'm required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. It's been about an hour and I've already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as ""Can you not??"" 

It would seem that [there is a list](http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on Venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. It's been a fun morning.

Edit #3: Despite all this annoyance, Venmo is still really useful and I'd recommend it. Just avoid funding rogue states and terrorists while you pay for mundane items. It's hard, but I'm sure you can manage. 

Edit #4: They let the payment go through. At least their CS dept is pretty quick on these things. I hope that video made someone's day at Venmo. Now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. My monthly payments to the KGB and ISIS are late...

Edit #5: Removed Stranger Things link due to personal info issues.

gvtdt1,TIFU by barging into the bathroom to find my cousin fully nude while holding my boner,27853,0.79,1930,2020-06-03 18:22:23,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gvtdt1/tifu_by_barging_into_the_bathroom_to_find_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gvtdt1/tifu_by_barging_into_the_bathroom_to_find_my/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,,False,"This happened yesterday and also english is not my first language so apologize if there are any grammatical error. Info I [21M] and my cousin [24F]

I know this is the most cliche story but whatever I just wanna share. I was staying with my aunt for a week as a mini break because my class has already ended and i just need to finish a final project for my grade. Me being horny af because of exams and such these past month haven't had the time to properly relax and releive myself which leads to rock hard morning wood every morning. 

That day I woke up but haven't fully regained my consciousness so I was still half asleep. I  had a huge urge to pee and I said to myself ""fuck better take care of this or I'm gonna have self-induced golden shower."" I got out of bed and hurried to the bathroom. When I wss really near the bathroom I had this bright idea to pull my pants waistband down and let it spring into action, for efficiency sake so I could go back to sleep asap. I barged right in and there she was, my cousin, fully naked both hands on her hair and me boner in hand. She was surprised as she has that deer in headlight looks on her and so did I. Now this is where I fucked up. We both froze, and we just looked at each other, scanning each other. As I was still half-asleep I thought to myself ""fuck she is hot!"". Until I snapped back to reality and realized it is her that all this time I was looking at. I pulled my pants up and immediately closed the door all in one smooth move as I said sorry multiple times. I ran back to my room in panic as I try to compose myself. When I'm back to my senses I forgot that I had to pee so I used the other bathroom (the bathroom that this incident happened was closer so I used that one) and went back to my room.

I'm fucked and I'm just glad that we both just froze and she didn't scream or something as it might've caused a scene. A bit of background my family is conservative, and this is especially true for my aunt family's and my cousin in particular. And I never thought of her other than a cousin. She is just a very kind, wholesome and fun person so we hang out a lot. And now I don't think I could look her in the eye. Fuck I feel so guilty.

This kind of thing has never happened to me before. I mean I have barged into my mom and my distant cousin in the past but it was nothing in my opinion as I always immediately apologize and close the door. The thing is I could remember that incident with her crystal clear, like every detail. God I'm so fucked.

I haven't met her since but my aunt has planned dinner for all of us tomorrow so its only a matter of time

Edit 1: both bathrooms have locks on them and I have checked the one where it happened that it was functioning properly.

Edit 2: words and formatting

TL;DR Hurried to the bathroom half-asleep boner in hand to find my cousin fully nude and we scanned each other like xerox as her nude is imprinted in my consciousness.

Mini Update: 
So this morning she went to the room I'm using to let me know that breakfast is ready which to my head feels unusual. I went to the kitchen area get my food and sat with her in living room watching tv. As I ate I noticed something is different with her, she wasn't upset or anything but her vibe has changed. I don't know how to describe it tbh. We chatted a bit and I tried to come up with as many random topic as possible because I didn't want her to discuss what happened as my aunt is still in the kitchen area which is right next to the living room so she could hear everything. Finished my meal asap and excused myself back to my room. Throughout the day up to this point as I'm writing this she seems to kinda noticed me whenever I'm around. I don't know whether it was real or it was just in my mind. 

I haven't had any proper talk about it with her. Yes, we usually lock the doors. Yes, I rarely knock. Objectively speaking yes she is insanely hot, like she has the ratio to summarize. I don't think I'm gonna go forward with this and I'm definitely don't wanna get kicked out just because of this. I plan to talk to her tonight after dinner.

Update: 
Dinner went well I think. My aunt is also normal so I assume she hasn't talked to her about the incident. We generally just talked about the protest, covid and stuff so there aren't anything worth of mention. I did noticed throughout dinner the way she looked at me was.. attentive, like she was looking at me more than usual. I can't confirm really as I was more focused on the foods because it was so good. 

Anyway dinner was done and I planned on going to her room afterwards when she is by herself. I must say I was really nervous at this point. I went there and her door was open and I could see that she was drawing something (her hobby is drawing so it is normal). I asked her that I wanted to talk about something. She said ""Sure"" while gestured to sit right next to her. For additional context in her room there is also a couch, a medium size one for like 2 people. I sat there and she was still fixated on her thing. I then apologized for what happened while stammering a bit because I was still nervous. When I was done, she stopped drawing and I looked at her face and she was blushing, I guess. I don't know really but I think there was a bit redness on her face. She just said ""Oh, okay"". Dead silence. I guess I must've zoned out beacause I expected more response from her and I was like ""That's it? Really?"". When I snapped back I asked her what did she draw this time to shift the topic because the situation was really awkward. It was about herself and proceed to make jokes(SFW) about it to break the ice. We both laughed for quite sometime as I try my damndest to lighten up the mood. After the mood is back to normal and we were done laughing I said to her that I have to do something. 

Now this the part that gets me. She then leans in and gave me a hug which really suprised me as she has never done it to me before. So I hugged back as I thought it would be rude to leave her hanging. It wasn't a tight hug I think just a normal hug. When were done she said ""I knew you'd feel the same"" with a big smile on her face. I have no idea what she was referring to as my mind was still surprised. So I blurted out ""Of course I would"" In which I then immediately excused myself and we said goodnight to each other. 

To this point of writing I still can't figure out what we were talking about because there was so much thought in my head that I wasn't really focused on the conversation itself. Tbh I don't think I wanna know what she was talking about. I just hope that was just some random shit and it was enough of an explanation and everything is clear so I can get this over with.

Final Update: Since some people requested an update. I left this morning and as I'm writing this I'm already back at my place. I tried not to think much about what happened as I didn't want to open a chapter in my life with this direction. I also didn't have anymore serious talk with her. The only thing of interest is that we spent yesterday watching the entire season of Netflix's The Witcher. I suggested it to her because I'm huge witcher fan and she hasn't seent it either and really intrigued in it. We already planned this way before the incident so there is nothing weird about it. We watched together on this couch-ish-bed thingy but I was too focused on The Witcher so I barely pay any attention on how she was with me. As I said I played all this safely because I didn't want to jeopardize my relationship with her. I also blocked all kind of thoughts of her in that direction, iykwim. That was it tbh."
dd5j44,TIFU for thinking of moving home because of a noise that was making me crazy,27848,0.88,683,2019-10-04 16:00:54,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dd5j44/tifu_for_thinking_of_moving_home_because_of_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dd5j44/tifu_for_thinking_of_moving_home_because_of_a/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"a few months ago I was lying in bed about to fall asleep, when I start to hear a noise that seems to come from upstairs.

the noise was like a bouncing ball falling. the ball began to fall from very high and the noise intensified as it began to approach the ground. then stop. and would come back again.

the sound was soft but very close.

I am someone who sleeps anywhere, anytime, in any position. I'm like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.

the sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes I heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because I couldn't concentrate if I was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.

this went on for over a month.

one night I was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).

and of course there was that motherfucker again.

I did not think. I got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.

so there I was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, I didn't even bother to put my shoes on.

so there I was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.

as I approached the door I could hear a lot of noise in their house. I ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.

so there I was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise ""like a falling bouncing ball"" coming from that apartment.

she tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.

I still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it's been a month and I'm starting to go crazy.

she says she doesn't know where the noise might come from. There is nothing at home that can make a sound that I tried to mimic.

yes, I imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.

so there I was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until I say, without much thought, ""wanna go see it?""

so there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.

and of course, nothing happened.

I apologized to everyone, I took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.

this was last week.

today a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. I was hysterical.

""ARE YOU HEARING THIS""

""yea...""

""I can no longer with this noise, I think I'll have to move house.""

""it comes from your warmer ...""

so my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: I'm retarded."
pnr4mt,TIFU by drugging the bartender and ruining a wedding,27842,0.93,1053,2021-09-14 05:06:32,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/pnr4mt/tifu_by_drugging_the_bartender_and_ruining_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/pnr4mt/tifu_by_drugging_the_bartender_and_ruining_a/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Ya so this fuck up happened the summer before Covid but I think that statute of limitations are up so I can tell this story.

My wife and I went to her colleague's wedding. I'm not a huge drinker and I didn't really know anyone, so my plan was to grab some sort of cold refreshing beverage, find somewhere to post up, and nurse it while I got really stoned and did some people watching. Which leads me to *my drugs*. 

On the way to the wedding I stopped at a dispensary and picked up a reusable vape pen thing. I'm a pretty traditional smoker. I go to the place and buy an eighth and smoke it in my ancient bowl over the course of the next month or two. I'd never had a pen before. I was just like ""I'm going to a wedding and want something that won't make me sleepy or mentally handicapped"" and the young woman at the counter handed me the thing. 

As my wife was driving us over, I tried it out. I also don't smoke very much at any one time, and have a hard time with anything like joints or bongs etc. When I do smoke these things, they hit way too hard and I cough like crazy and hate myself. So I took a very small hit, noticed it hit *really hard* and thought ""well that's because you think everything hits too hard.""

Badabing badaboom, I'm at the reception standing in line to grab some drinks from the bartender and notice the tip jar. Realizing I don't have any cash, I'm like ""dude do you have venmo or something?"" (I know, lol) and he's like ""ahh don't even worry about it man it's no big deal"" but I'm a service industry vet so I wanted to find a way to tip him because I know it's gonna be a long night and a lot of people won't tip.

So I'm like ""alright man well, if my wife has some cash I'll double back over...but uh, in the meantime...if you party..."" and I show him the pen. 

He's like ""oh for real? hell ya dude."" And proceeds to take an *enormous* puff on this thing. 

Within seconds he was doubling over and coughing uncontrollably, it was incredibly loud and in under a minute he was down on his hands and knees behind the bar puking in the grass. Still...kind of no harm no foul...until he gets up and puts all of his weight onto a tumbler glass that was sitting on the table he used to help himself up. Cutting his hand open...so...so badly. 

And then something very interesting happened. Something that had never happened before. I started vomiting at the sight of the blood. 

So naturally this is pretty disruptive, and the groom who just so happened to be nearby, comes over to see what's going on *and fucking faints* the second he sees this guy's hand. Smashing his head on the bar/table on the way down, his face taking the table cloth and everything on the table down with him.

Totally unmitigated disaster. Both of them had to go to the hospital and the bride was understandably super upset and screaming at the caterers, so I decided ""well, it's been a good life"" and began to march over to explain to her what happened when out of her mouth comes a series of very specific slurs directed at the owner of the catering company. I didn't get a single word out of my mouth before she said ""fucking sue me"" turned on her heel and told her people to just round their shit up and go. 

Cue major shitstorm. Everyone is fighting with everyone, and almost all of the guests left. I told my wife what happened on the drive home and she said I should call the catering company and apologize, which I did, and the owner laughed for about 30 seconds on the phone before saying ""well, whatever, fuck that bitch."" 

So...ya. 

TLDR: Don't smoke a lot of weed, got the bartender way too high causing a chain reaction of vomiting and fainting that led to a racist outburst ending a wedding.

My girlfriend thought this was hilarious so I thought I'd share. This happened last night.

So I (30 m) flew home over the weekend to see some family. We have all had covid recently so not too worried. Ive been working from home for the last few months so I put on a few pounds and I had to get a new belt before the trip. Anyways last night I was running late for my flight home and I'm doing the mad dash through the airport. I get to security and start doing that whole song and dance. Taking the shoes off, jacket, laptop out of my bag, then I remembered I have my new belt on. I undo the buckle and try to pull it all the way out of the loops, doesn't budge. It's too stiff and new. So I assist it out of the first few loops, then I give it a tug again, nothing still stuck. All the while of course, the TSA agent is waiting on me, along with the huge line of people behind me anxiously waiting for their own strip tease act. Irritated, I give the belt one more hard tug, and it WHIPS out of my pants and slaps the man's ass in front of me. You know how the lion tamers will pop their whip for show? Or the boys on the locker room will pop each other with their towels? I just did this to a man (with some gusto, I might add) that I do not know. He was actually a pilot in his uniform. He whips his head around to look at me with shock. TSA agent is cackling, I'm standing there with my mouth open stunned. I apologized profusely and he was understanding. Then we stood awkwardly next to each other for probably another (long) 10 minutes. Anyways, I think we were both grateful to get out of that line..

Tldr: I pulled my belt out of my pants with gusto which resulted in me slapping another man's ass with it.

Edit: Wow guess I need to add that covid was 3 months ago and we are not contagious anymore. Yes I am aware that you can get it again, but from what I've read chances are low, this soon after having it. I was visiting my dad who is leaving the country for 4 years. I wouldn't have traveled otherwise. Sheesh."
jbml2l,TIFU by listening to my dick instead of my doctor,27811,0.9,1184,2020-10-15 17:57:40,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jbml2l/tifu_by_listening_to_my_dick_instead_of_my_doctor/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/jbml2l/tifu_by_listening_to_my_dick_instead_of_my_doctor/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"Okay it was Friday, not today, but close enough.

I had a vasectomy last Tuesday, and my doctor told me to wait a week at least before masturbating/having sex. As someone who has a high sex drive, this was a tall order, and despite the incredible bruising and pain of the first two days, I found myself absurdly horny. My wife enjoyed my pain immeasurably and teased me a lot my whipping out her boobs regularly, knowing I was powerless to do anything about it.

So Friday morning, things were still a bit tender, but I had decided that the surgeon clearly didn't know anything and that the Internet, which said ""whenever you feel up to it"" was a more reliable source of info. That morning while my wife was taking our daughter to school I decided to take my dick and balls for a test ride.

Everything was going really well, and I'd gotten all set up at my wife's desk and was making it a really special wank (just the right video selection, lube etc), and just as I came, everything started to go wrong.

Firstly, a week's worth of jizz, some weird clear liquid and a little blood from my op came gushing forth, overwhelming my poorly prepared fold of toilet paper  that normally suffices, spilling everywhere, including into my wife's net fabric chair cushions. Simultaneously, my balls start to ache like hell.

By the afternoon my balls had swollen up and every time I stood up it was like someone was pulling strings attached to rusty knives somewhere in my crotch, and my balls generally felt like they'd had a good kicking. This persisted for about 5 days, and now on Thursday they are just about back to normal.


Tl;Dr, jerked off before the doctor said I should after a vasectomy, jizzed cum and blood everywhere and made my balls hurt like hell for nearly a week. Listen to your surgeon/doctor!

Edit: to answer the most common questions - 

my wife thought I was an idiot, but is a lovely woman and was mostly concerned for my nuts' wellbeing... But only because she doesn't know about the chair.

The chair, and my balls, are all fine now. 

Yes I'm gross, I know. 

I love Cannibal Corpse, and yes I'm aware of the song.

Thank you everyone for sharing your vasectomy stories, many of which had me in stitches (no I didn't have stitches before you crack a joke about that)"

Last September my ex wife and I filed for divorce. We were separated. One of my best friends says I should try dating. She’s never led me astray so I say fuck it, why not. First girl I match with on Hinge seems nice. We talk for a few days since I’m on a business trip and plan to go out when I get back. She’s a therapist. Works with neurodivergent kids. We chat a bit. Alls good.

We go on our first date after work on a Tuesday. I pick her up at her place. Go to my favorite pizza joint in her area. Starts a bit awkward as first dates do. She then tells me, “I [the girl] can’t wait to tell you I’m pregnant.” Okay. Weird. Maybe the nerves. Understand we had no booze at this point. I think she’s just nervous. Great.

A few minutes later she’s telling me about her parents who live near the Wisconsin/Minnesota boarder, and we are in the Chicagoland area. These parents show up… and sit down with us. YET, THEY LIVED IN THE GREAT WHITE NORTH. So I’m against the wall of the booth with her dad sitting next to me. She’s across from me. Her mom next to her. Shit. Okay. Guess I’m paying for their meal too. Double date. Great.

Mom and Dad tell me they’ve heard a lot about me yada yada (how much could they know?) they talk about what it’s like working for a vocational school. So I start freaking out as I’ve only said I’m a school admin, nothing more, not where I work. I say it’s great, but I’m looking to go back to the middle school or elementary next year.

Dad says he can’t wait to have a son in law like me. Mom says she can’t wait to have me marry into the family. Awkward. They were drinking. So I give them a pass.

Awkward evening continues. Yada yada get to know you shit. We start leaving and I picked up this chick, so I’ve gotta drop her off; Grandma raised a gentleman, you know? Figured I’d do that and dip. Nope. We get back, parents park next to me. Fuck. Invite me up. Mom said she baked a great pumpkin pie earlier today.

Well shit. I love me some pumpkin pie. Decide fuck it, might as well get something out of this night. Had some pie. Truthfully, some of the best pumpkin pie I’ve ever had. I try to leave and they weren’t really letting me by giving me more pie or starting a new conversation topic. Best friend (one who told me to start dating) calls. Asks what’s up. Took the call in the bathroom and she comes up with this plan: I’m going to go pick up my friend “Eddie” (because she thought I shouldn’t use a girls name) with his flat tire. Great. I got an out.

She says she needs to walk her dog (annoying shit. Yapping dog. Rubbing his ass on everything and dragging his ass across the floor. Very poorly trained). Fuck. Fine. Come with and walk me down. Mom comes to. I’m standing there trying to leave as chick takes her dog for a shit. Mom says it’s nice to meet me yada yada. And says “I’m so glad [daughter] found you. I didn’t think she’d be able to settle down since we’ve had her committed three times.” And walks away. Wtf. Bomb dropped.

I’m panicking now, sweating a bit. I turn to get in my car and chick is right there. Hugs me. Tries to kiss me. Yada yada. Tells me “I love you, and can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.” 

Me: great… gotta go. You know… friend needs help. 

I get in the car, this chick is in my rear mirror and she’s calling me. I pick up and she said “you didn’t say you love me!”

Best friend calls, “oops. Hang on important call” and picks up. Tells my buddy this. she’s laughing her ass off. I’m scared shitless at this point thinking headlights in my rear view mirror are her. So I start speeding for the highway. 

Im speeding away. Get pulled over. Cop asks why. I tell him EVERYTHING. Takes a good 5-6 min to get him to understand. He noticed I have Wisconsin plates. All he says is “Bro…and gives me great advice: never put your dick in crazy.” Thanks brochacho. Cop feels sorry for me and escorts me to the highway. Great. Freedom.

Chick texts me. I try to ghost her. Now, I left out an important detail. I went on a school night, wearing spirit wear with my school logo; once you know the name it’s hard not to find as I’m the only type of school like this in my county. I go to my boss the next day and tell him. Says I’m a fucking idiot for wearing my work shirt. Laughs his ass off about the whole situation. Asks if I blocked her. Shit. That’s a good idea. So I do it. Tells me I’m a fucking idiot again for not thinking this through. 

She figured out where I worked. And starts calling my desk. Asking when we are going out. Leaves a message says she wants to be engaged by the time she’s 30 (which was weeks away, literally the next month, since we went over birthdays). At this point I’m freaking out. I have an SRO (school resource officer) in my building. I tell him what happened. Gave her name. He told me he’d take care of it if she came by. But also told me to move my car to the back (gated and can’t see, dudes a saint and it was a great idea).

Chick shows up asking to see me. Security tells her I don’t work here. She gets snotty with the SRO. Gets escorted out. Calls my desk phone pleading with me to give her a chance. Finds my sister. My best friend all on Facebook. Tells them we are soulmates. I tell them to block her ass. 

Chick was crazy. Got her to calm the ef out when I told her I’m going to report her for harassment to her licensing board (all bullshit, no idea if that would do anything).
And that kids, is the story of how I met your mother. 

Kidding. But damn was I scared of dating for a bit.

TLDR: went on a date with a therapist. Almost ended up married again."
ttl7h7,TIFU by removing my girlfriend's tattoos in photoshop and realising I'm not as attracted to her as I thought and now I'm terrified for the future,27789,0.8,3762,2022-04-01 13:13:53,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ttl7h7/tifu_by_removing_my_girlfriends_tattoos_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ttl7h7/tifu_by_removing_my_girlfriends_tattoos_in/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"TL:DR at the bottom.

Enjoy my fuck-up story, oddly enough for this sub, it did happen yesterday. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.

&#x200B;

Me and my girlfriend exchange nudes frequently. They never leave our phones/computers and we trust each other on that. I like to mess around in photoshop as a hobby and often times I use my gf's nudes for practice. Change the lighting, remove/add things in the background, sometimes I edit her into a playboy cover for a laugh. A few days ago I bought a new laptop, as my old one died some time ago. I installed photoshop on it yesterday and wanted to mess around with it. I found some tutorials online about photoshop tattoo removal and decided to give it a try. Seeing as I had no work the next day, I also decided to get high. I gathered some pics of my girlfriend and went to work. 

My girlfriend has a big tattoo on her upper chest (covering her collar bones and the upper part of her boobs), two smaller pieces on her hips, one between her shoulder blades and some smaller ones on her legs and arms. When we met she already had all the major ones and she did two more while with me. It has never bothered me, I thought her tattoos are cool. But before falling for her I never imagined myself to be with such a heavly tattooed girl but I hadn't really thought about it since then.

Now, I edited the pictures, starting from the smaller tattoos and evencually getting rid of the big chest one. I followed a tutorial and made a damn good job in my opinion. I ended up doing three pics and when I was admiring my work I got very... Well, I got hornier then I ever had in my life. 

I've always considered my gf's body to be a 10/10. That combined with her wonderful personality made me fall in love quick and hard, and I didn't even think to wonder how she would look like if she didn't have the tattoos. Well now I know. And to me she would look infinitly better.

I regret using photoshop a lot last night. She obviously can't get rid of the tattoos. Not only would it be horribly expensive, but also she really loves them. Also I don't think it's my place to even ask that. She's also a tattoo artist and scheduled to have a ""half a body"" tattoo done in two or so months by another artist who she's a great fan of. I won't ask her to skip the tattoo. She's very excited about it and has been saving up for a long time. I was never particularly happy that she was getting it, but I was just glad she was excited and again, it's her choice what she puts on her body.

Now I realise just I don't like tattoos on her. I thought a lot last night and realised the signs were there, but for some reason it has never occured to me. For example when we chatted about her tattoo plans I asked her not to tattoo her tummy too soon because I like how soft it lookes on it's own. She would say in that a few years I will have a wife covered from head to toe in ink and I always laughed it off because I didn't want to think about it. I also had a shameful realisation that I've been enjoying sex a lot more since we started to do it doggy style. The one tattoo on her back usually get's covered by her hair so you can't see any tattoos. 

I'm kinda freaking out. As I mentioned, my ""favourite parts"" of her  body are the ones with no tattoes on them, that being the back and her waist. The tattoo she's getting is going to go from her arm, down her side and down the leg. Which means it will be pretty much impossible to not see. I'm really ashamed to say I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her when she does it. I'm afraid to even bring it up because she has horrible body image issues and I'm scared she would be really effected if I said I'm worried about her getting the tattoo. I also know with the way things are going (her becoming a tattoo artist and such) she is going to get more. 

I deleted the pictures this morning. They give an ultra boner but the worst moral hangover ever.

&#x200B;

TL:DR

I removed my gf's tattoos in photoshop and found out I'm much more attracted to her without them. She's getting a body-long piece done in two months and I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her as I am now."
mexvk5,TIFU by almost killing my roommates brother,27764,0.91,3355,2021-03-28 14:32:48,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mexvk5/tifu_by_almost_killing_my_roommates_brother/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mexvk5/tifu_by_almost_killing_my_roommates_brother/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"I’m using a throwaway account as i’m guessing what i did isn’t exactly legal. I’m sorry if this is long, i’ll include a TL;DR at the end. 

It didn’t happen today but 2 years ago, i was living with a roommate while i saved for my own place. My roommate was lovely (for the most part) but her little brother was always staying with us. Her brother was lazy, never did any chores at all and had pretty much turned the living room into his own personal bedroom without ever paying a cent in rent. As unbearable as that already was, he did the most annoying thing that any roommate could do which is stealing food. 

He was CONSTANTLY stealing my food, pretty much everyday. It started with him just taking ingredients like flour or coffee which i didn’t care about but eventually he started stealing snacks and even took my leftover meals a few times. Eventually i got sick of this and confronted him (I knew it was him because my roommate was a vegetarian and he wasn’t). 

I confronted him a total of i think 3 times and every time i did, he would deny it or just laugh it off, blaming my forgetfulness or my boyfriend (who happened to be celiac so most of the things that disappeared were off limits for him). This drove me insane to the point that i eventually just bought my own fridge and put it in my bedroom. 

As you can imagine, this did not stop him. He even took coffee creamer from my fridge and left it on the counter to spoil. This led to me screaming at him to leave which made my roommate furious (turns out she wasn’t as nice as i thought) and he was back in the house 2 days later. My landlord was a jerk and i knew that asking him to deal with RM’s bro wouldn’t work however i did ask to install a lock on my bedroom door but he said he would only let me do it if i payed a fee. He was only asking me to pay something like $30 but i thought that was insane and refused.

Not wanting to piss off the landlord anymore, i decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that my roommate’s brother was allergic to strawberries however i didn’t know how severe this allergy was. I also knew that he absolutely loved buffalo wings (because he’d taken them multiple times before) and later that night, in blind rage, i decided to make some buffalo wings with... a secret ingredient. 

Sure enough my plan worked and i got a call at work from my sobbing roommate. She was in the back of an ambulance with her brother because he’d had an extremely severe allergic reaction. At the time she cussed me out for putting strawberries in buffalo wings and not warning anyone but what her brother failed to tell her is that he’d snuck into my bedroom to steal them. Once i told her this, she calmed down a bit and was just frustrated. I didn’t tell her that i’d done it on purpose but i’m sure she would’ve put 2+2 together at some stage. 

Her brother was okay in the end although i did find out that he would’ve died if she weren’t home at the time. He never came back to the house after that and I only saw him one more time before I moved out two months later. I feel incredibly guilty that i could’ve cost him his life over some food but at the time, i thought the allergy was fairly minor and i’m sure he’s learnt his lesson about stealing food now. 

TL;DR: Roommates brother persistently stole my food, even breaking into my room to do so. I made buffalo wings with a special ingredient and he nearly died of an allergic reaction.

EDIT: Some people are misinterpreting the part about the fee for the lock so i’d just like to clarify. My landlord wanted me to pay him $30 so i could buy my own lock and install it myself. He said the fee was for potential damages to the door or something similar."
miwtmb,LPT: TIFU by accidentally jizzing on a female nurse,27754,0.68,1664,2021-04-03 05:19:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/miwtmb/lpt_tifu_by_accidentally_jizzing_on_a_female_nurse/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/miwtmb/lpt_tifu_by_accidentally_jizzing_on_a_female_nurse/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"Back   story to this.  So the wife and I are going through IVF right now  which  involves me having to jizz in a cup, to my displeasure.  The only  booth  sized room a man should jack off in is at a peep show.  First  off you  can't jack off for four days, you sit on this padded waiting  room chair  with like a toilet seat cover on it, and it's just  incredibly awkward  for me.

I  arrive at the doctors  office and am greeted by a fairly attractive  nurse.  She leads me to the  room, gives me the ""supplies,"" and opens  the door to the room.  I'm in  the room, with the cup, got some videos  pulled up on my phone, and I  start going at it.  Like I said, it is  incredibly awkward for me.   Usually I take breaks and just start back  up again.  Right behind the  chair is a button you push to get the nurse's  attention when you're done  and the sample is ready to be collected.   I'm working up to it and as I  leaned back briefly I must've pushed the  button.  I stand up ready to  collect ""the sample,"" and the door opens  and I hear ""alright is  everyth.....""   It caught me by surprise so I  quickly turn towards the  door and ""finish,"" right on her pant leg.   Immediately I can feel my  face just turning red with embarrassment.  We  both stand in disbelief  for what seemed like forever.  I try my best  to just say that I'm sorry  but surprisingly she wasn't too phased by  it.  She just grabbed a  tissue, cleaned off her pant leg, and just  asked ""well do you need  another collection cup?""  I told her that I  would be out in a moment.  I  go back out, wash my hands, and meet her  at the front desk.  She made  it seem like nothing happened which was  beyond professional on her part  and we simply scheduled another  appointment.

tl;dr:   I had to  jizz in a cup for IVF and right when I was about to blow the  nurse  walked in, caught me by surprise, and I finished on her pant leg

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the awards!  I didn't think that my unfortunate incident would attract this much attention.  I'm loving some of the comments.  Now I can't answer every question individually so let me clear some things up.  
\- The lock on the door.  No there was not a lock on the door.  Rather outside there is an occupied sign.  This is, I am assuming, for safety in case something happens  
\- The call button.  So as I explained when you are ""finished,"" you press a green call button and place the collection cup into a metal box attached to the wall.  Then the nurse will come in and make sure that you filled out the information correctly on your collection cup  
\- No, there is no needle to the ball sack involved with IVF.  At least with our clinic there isn't  
\- ""I went through IVF and never did this.""  Well I don't know how your process went but with me I've had to provide several analysis collections along with semen cultures.  I'm most likely going to have to provide more once our cycle starts  
\- Thank you everyone who is wishing us success in our journey with IVF.  It's been a very stressful last 7 months.  Especially with COVID and trying to schedule all of the appointments.

dq5r4o,TIFU by accidentally making my friend's parents think I was having lesbian sex with their daughter,27745,0.89,843,2019-11-01 20:58:19,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dq5r4o/tifu_by_accidentally_making_my_friends_parents/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dq5r4o/tifu_by_accidentally_making_my_friends_parents/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but I was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought I'd share.

This happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. This meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who I'll call H) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn't specified which one (important later).

So one day H invited me over to watch a film after school. When I arrived I said hi to her parents then went upstairs with H to her bedroom to watch the film. This is where the fuck up slowly started. First of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when I visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn't want to be disturbed by her parents. Then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. We really didn't think much about either of these things.

Anyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. Now this is where I really fucked up, I was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. H found this really funny so I continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. At some point during this time I heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. Some more important information to know is that H is asexual (meaning that she doesn't experience sexual attraction and doesn't want to have sex), and her parents don't know this about her because she doesn't like to talk to them about that kind of thing. This means that I constantly forget that most people don't know this about her.

Another 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. We thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. H shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. We were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. H picked up the paper and it said ""we're going to get McDonalds for dinner do you want anything?"".

We were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. Then it dawned on me and I turned to H and asked her ""Do your parents think we were fucking?"", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell I had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. We had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, I had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... Not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. Also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn't know which one it was, and didn't know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.

We immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. When we went downstairs to say what we wanted from McDonald's her parents couldn't look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. After the McDonalds I left and H spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that I had a boyfriend (which her parents didn't know about). I think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. Luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.

TL;DR Went round to a female friend's house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... Now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open."

This past Saturday our school's girls Cross Country team won state and because of that earned everyone a pep rally. The night before someone asked if anyone wanted to be the flag runner and I [happily volunteered](https://i.imgur.com/qfllRsL.jpg), because that's a super dope job. I mean what could possibly go wrong?

Well here is exactly what went wrong:
 
The pep rally is in motion. The Cross Country Team starts pouring down from the stands to lead a school cheer. This is exactly when you should do a flag run, so I start haulin' out and narrowly avoid plowing one girl and make my way around the crowd (Definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend now though). I am caught up in the buzz of the moment and then all of a sudden I'm [going down hard...](https://i.imgur.com/XPL4P0i.mp4)
All that is going through my head is siren noises and me thinking ""I should just die now"" but unfortunately that never came to fruition and it got worse as I saw what I had tripped on and destroyed: [The state trophy we just won AND the one from last year!](https://i.imgur.com/gyAgaiL.png)
Now I'm a bit more famous around the school and kids keep seeing me in the hallway an saying ""OMG! You're the kid who broke the trophy!!""
RIP me

TL;DR I was the flag runner and I tripped over and destroyed two state trophies in front of the whole school.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold! That makes it all worth it (sort of)! Just a bit of extra info, the trophies have been repaired with tender, sweet words and some wood glue.

EDIT 2: Wow 5 gold I'm willing to destroy another trophy, if it nets me 5 more!"

For background, I’m a self-employed audio engineer who mostly records local musicians out of my apartment studio, and potential clients, and as you’d imagine, are usually artists or bands who want to record their music. However, every so often I get other requests, such as recording audio for a local radio commercial, or being asked to improve recordings they have done themselves, such as in today’s case…

“Hi, is this Marmalade Recording Studio?”. Its 4pm and I am not much in the mood to record any new clients but he proceeds to inform me he is outside the studio right now and just needs me to clean up some audio he recorded on his phone. I tell him that he can email it and I’ll return it the next day, but that wasn’t going to work with Joe here. He sounds desperate as he explains, “I have been suspicious that my wife has been cheating on me with our neighbor”. He proceeds to tell me how he started an audio recording on his phone, hid it in his bedroom, and left for work. When he returned later the phone had recorded nearly 6 hours of audio. He got back in his car and sat in his driveway for a minute, composing and preparing himself, connected his phone to Bluetooth and began playing this recording, while “driving around aimlessly”. He says he thinks he is “hearing his wife moan” and potentially a male voice is in there as well and needs to the audio improved so he can be sure. He lives two hours south of me and said he got off the freeway and googled recording studio and I was the first one that popped up. Jeez, I can’t say no. I tell him to stay I’ll come meet him outside and we’ll get this audio cleaned up a bit.

Joe here seems like a good enough guy, though very emotionally distraught. I’m filling up a glass of water for him before we sit at the computer. He’s just giving that stare at the wall, that mindless stare, and I lead him into the studio room. He airdrops me the audio file, and sure enough it’s 6 hours long. My immediate thought is I’ll clean up the audio and I’ll see in the waveform where it gets…louder. He is just sitting there in disbelief. A few minutes later, after making the most awkward small talk he asks me if anything is going wrong in my life, laughs, and clarifies that it’d make him feel better knowing someone else is going through a hard time.

I’m really feeling for this guy and noticing a few loud parts looking at this file. He interrupts and says he can’t listen and asks if I can just send him “definitive proof” that she is cheating on him. “I don’t need anything long, just maybe 15 seconds. That’s probably all I could bear to hear”. I tell him I’ll return something tonight and that I won’t charge him because, well how could I?

I make myself a drink after he leaves and I get another phone call. This time from a potential client who wants to discuss recording his band. These are my favorite calls and guarantees good money. 9 songs is the plan and after our call he sends me a demo of one of his songs. Pretty good stuff, kinda bluegrass style. Simultaneously, Joe sends me a text thanking me.

I hit play. It’s mostly nonsense, the TV is going, randomly I’m hearing a little girl in the background (he told me I might since they have a two year old daughter) . But after sometime I stumble on something, I’m thinking this might validate his suspicions. It sounds like a woman, enjoying herself, along with a guy grunting. There it is.

I send him this clip and I don’t know what to add, so I just text, “I think this is what you’re looking for”. I sit back down and continue my drink, loading up the song I was working before Joe called me in the first place.

Two hours go by and I get a call, and it’s from Joe. I am hesitant to answer because I don’t want to work anymore on this infidelity jam and I am not so much in the mood to be a shoulder to cry on, it seems to be a recurring issue in my line of work. But I answer. “Hey, are you going to send me anything tonight?”, he asks. I’m a bit confused and tell him I texted him a while ago. He checks his phone and says he didn’t get anything from me. My heart sinks, I know I sent that audio to someone. I tell Joe I’ll send it right over. I’m dying to get off the phone to figure out who received a 15 second audio clip of screaming infidelities. Dammit. I sent it to the bluegrass guy. This guy sends me a cool demo and I replied with sex sounds. I decide I should probably follow up that text and I write to him saying “whoops wrong person” and I am just laughing my ass off, thinking that might smooth things over. I proceed to send the audio over to Joe. Then I remember Joe is likely going to be crying himself to sleep tonight. Bluegrass guy never responded and Joe wrote back 10 minutes later saying ""thanks"".

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: a bummed out dude secretly recorded his wife banging another guy and asked me to clean up the audio and send him a short clip from the recording. I accidentally sent that recording to a potential client who never responded after I said “whoops wrong person”."

She then told me she has a condition that causes her pupils to dilate when she’s crazy stressed or anxious and it causes her to temporarily go blind. (It’s called BEUM according to Google) apparently as we found out today, rough sex can trigger it too.

We have two kids together (4f,2m). My wife got sick just after our son was born and now is in need of a kidney transplant. We checked with her relatives and none were a match or a viable doner.

Last week I got tested. I knew it would be a long shot so I decided to get tested to see if I could donate. I got a call the other day saying that I was a match. The doctor then said something about wanting to do additional testing due to some information from the HLA tissue test results. I didn't think much of it and agreed.

Then the results came in I was shocked and confused. He explained that because of how DNA information is passed down through generations a parent to a child could have at least a 50% match. Siblings could have a 0-100% match. It was rare to have a high match as husband and wife. I asked what does that mean.

He said that my wife and I have an ""abnormally high match percentage.""

Long story short were related. No I'm not kidding. I was put up for adoption before I was born. Placed into a family that moved across the country. I knew I was adopted but we didn't have any I formation about my bio family. It was a closed adoption.

I met my wife by chance 8 years ago. I was on a trip from work and she was working at the sight I went to. We worked together for a week. We exchanged numbers kept in touch. I was sent back there 3 more times that year and each time we became closer. I was given the opertunity to be transferred out there in a new higher paying position in a different department as hers the rest is history.

I don't know what do do moving forward but I know it may be wrong. She is my wife and the mother of our kids. This post is probably going to get removed but it is all true.

TL;DR: Wife of 6 years needs a kidney I got tested and we have an abnormally high match percentage for being husband and wife.

Edit: look at name. All of my family is from my adopted parents. My parents adopted me 2 minutes after I was born. Their name is on my Birth certificate. They have not told me anything about my bio parents and don't have any info.
Her family is not a match as stated above most of her family has low match potential or can't donate due to medical or other reasons.
I am 2 years older than my wife. I do know that my wife was born when her parents were late teens."

I found this nice video and started… uhh you get it. Just a dude being a dude to some futanari. 

Literally right as I’m about to finish wanking, my fucking father comes in to tell me breakfasts ready. 

I don’t know who looked more traumatized and in shock. 

And when I thought it couldn’t get any fucking worse, I came. I fucking came all over my keyboard. It’s like we were both paralyzed with fear. He left a few minutes after standing still in fear, disappointment, and sadness. 

Breakfast was as awkward as it gets when you catch your son jerking off to futanari rule 34.

That was about as awkward as it gets when you get caught jerking off to anime chicks with dicks. My dad was in the military so he’s pretty tough and will probably get over this. However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat. 

I fucking hate myself and want to die. My friends are gonna bully me so hard if I tell them, and yet I feel like I need to confess about what happened. I think I can take being bullied by Reddit.

TLDR; Got caught watching hentai chicks with dicks, and I might get disowned.

Edit 1: Hey guys I got banned from Reddit and can only update posts. I removed the bi thing. My reasoning at the time was a girl who has a cock is pretty bi. I mean I’m attracted to girls and guys so a girl with a cock seemed pretty bi to me but I’m kinda wrong since straight people can also like futa.

Also fuck off you degenerates I’m not sharing the sauce. It’s a hardcore pounding video on nhentai. The girl has pink hair. I send you on a mighty fap quest to find it.

Dad got pissed and yelled at me. Mom cried. Life is awkward and I woke up to over 20k upvotes. Dad even threatened to kick me out. He’s a pussy though and didn’t do it. We had a talk. He’s seen weirder shit but he was surprised to see his own son like weird shit like futa and hentai. Mom might’ve disowned me but at this point I’m too numb to care.

It was actually the most fun job I have ever had.  I am usually really good with people...but...

I delivered pizza to a house like I have done a million times.  As I walk up to the door, all I can smell is pot, and can hear loud music.  I figured it was a party.  I knock, and there was no answer.  I knock louder.  This massive dude with hair down to his ass answers and yells at me for knocking too loud.  I apologized, and went on my way.

Next weekend, I see the same address come up, but unit ""B"" (it was a 4 plex type thing).  I walk down the concrete steps to unit ""B"", and knock on the door.  This tall bald dude answers.  I ask him if he knows the guy upstairs, and told him the asshole upstairs yelled at me for knocking too loud.  He looks at me puzzled, and says ""I know, that was me, I bought this 4 plex"".  The dude shaved his head.  From hair to his ass, to bald.  I didn't recognize him at all.  I instantly died on the inside.  I apologized and went on my way.

Next weekend...same address.  Remember those concrete steps I mentioned?  When I walked down them, the loop on my pizza bag got hooked on his mail box that was hung on the fence.   It ripped the mail box clear off the fence, and flung it down the stairs.  It actually bounced off his door when it landed.  He opened the door to see me looking like a deer in headlights, frantically pointing at his mailbox (which was bent and twisted now) and trying to explain that I really didn't mean to do it.

nk8lvr,TIFU by not understanding baby shower gifts and giving my friends complex adult literature instead of baby books,27662,0.95,569,2021-05-25 02:44:56,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nk8lvr/tifu_by_not_understanding_baby_shower_gifts_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nk8lvr/tifu_by_not_understanding_baby_shower_gifts_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This happened this weekend. I'm (35m) not exactly the kinda guy who gets invited to baby showers very often. But it seems like everyone I know has matured about 10 years in the past 1 pandemic year. So suddenly, friends are getting married and pregnant, and so on.

One such couple, I've known for close to 10 years, has a baby girl due in July. Awesome for them. They are both pretty scholarly folks, with degrees in English. One is an author and one is a copywriter for a brand.

So when their baby shower invite said ""instead of a card, please bring a book so that whenever we read it, we'll think of you"" I *assumed* it meant they wanted to grow their already extensive library (I mean I was also getting them a baby gift). So I bought them, what I felt was, a deeply moving novel.

As my partner and I are driving out to their place, she says, ""I got them 'What tree am I' it's really cute and has pretty pictures. What book did you get them?""

Suddenly, a light goes off. I look at her blankly and ask, ""You got them a kids book?""

She puts her hand over her mouth in disbelief. ""Oh my god. Yes. It's a baby shower. You get them kids books. You know... for the baby. Why? What book did you get them?""

""Well, in my defense, 'The Bone Clocks' by David Mitchell is very captivating. And if you read it out loud in the right tone of voice, the baby probably won't even mind the horrific details about the Iraq war, genocide, murder, gender issues, or death cults.""

Needless to say, it seemed a little out of place next to, ""S is for Salmon"", ""Why do I love you"", ""Goodnight Moon"", and ""Irish Fairy Tales"".

I was also reminded that a 600+ page novel may not be a priority for new parents. Whatever, mine had the best critic reviews on the back.

EDIT: I definitely wasn't expecting this big of a response, so a few updates:

I'm genuinely humbled by everyone's stories here. My TIFU is less that I gave this book and more that I feel I committed some unspoken social faux pas, in that the spirit of the event is about preparing the parents for the child's needs and I didn't pick up on that and instead gave *them* a gift of a book (thinking it was a direct substitute for a card). But hearing from a lot of people that this would actually be a welcome gift makes me comfortable that maybe the faux pas is superseded.

As for the response, I wrote below: *I think the ultimate conclusion will still play out for a bit. But the immediate conclusion was, my friends were appreciative of the thought (they thought it was cute that I was thinking of them). Some of the guests were very confused and gave me the ""wait, who is this guy"" look. And other guests who have known me for a long time gave me the ""Yeah, that's typical \[mykreau\]"". So I guess, my TIFU was on brand. But I did get to at least explain it to the couple afterward and they laughed their asses off about how it unfolded. And I explained that they had an actual baby gift in the mail waiting for them. So I'm not a total monster.*

My partner never got upset at me about this. And she didn't shame my FU. She thought it was funny and said it gave a window into my personality.

Also, thanks for some of the additional book reccos.

TL;DR

TIFU by buying my friends a huge, dark, complex, adult novel for their baby shower instead of a kid's book."

A few times I've seen her talk to a guy who she seems to be friends with, I haven't seen anything romantic or flirtatious between them and I was pretty confident they weren't together. So my awkward self decided to talk to the guy and ask him if she was single (very junior high of me I know). He said he had no idea, that they know each other because they used to work together, and have been friends ever since. As he was talking she came walking over to us, and before I could stop him he turned to ask her:

(Paraphrasing what I remember)

Him: hey are you single? Becau-

Her: God it's about time! I have been waiting forever for you to ask me out.

Him: uh...

Her: ...is that not what you were asking?

Him: yeah it is! Are you free Saturday?

Her: absolutely! Text me, I have to get going soon.


Throughout this I was just standing there like a third wheel watching like a doofus. After she left he turned to me with an apologetic look on his face and said he'd always had a crush on her but never acted because he didn't want to hurt their friendship if she didn't feel the same way. 

I told him I completely understood and was happy for both of them.

All in all, -1 for me and +2 for them = net gain for love.

TL ; DR

Wanted to ask girl out, ended up getting her together with someone else."

I should start by saying I have two wonderful, loving big dogs, a GSD and a lab mix. Usually when my fiancé and I start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. 

Last night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must’ve been having a good dream). I was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. It was all going per usual, he was done, I was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. My eyes were closed and I was not being very quiet. Right as I was about to start my journey back down to earth I feel a long wet tongue on my face. Open my eyes, my GSD is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. 

Let me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. I pushed my dog away and my fiancé just burst into tears from laughing so hard. 

TL;DR we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. My GSD snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. 

Edit: I can’t believe the most popular Reddit post I will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! Also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win? 

Edit 2: GSD (German Shepard dog) for those of you angry about this, thank you for commenting and bringing my karma up even higher. Also for those of you confused about the whole process, just because my fiancé was finished doesn’t mean he didn’t help a girl out. "
myiva5,TIFU by not washing my dick for 19 years.,27610,0.84,6138,2021-04-26 03:36:55,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/myiva5/tifu_by_not_washing_my_dick_for_19_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/myiva5/tifu_by_not_washing_my_dick_for_19_years/,self.tifu,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"Today I present to you my lifelong fuckup. I'm a 19 year old guy, I own a penis, and I've never cleaned it properly in my life. 

So, today I was taking a piss at my job, and I noticed a small yellow fragment at the top of my penis. I wondered where it came from, the only logical answer was the inside of my dick. So I peeled my foreskin back, a little further every pull, and when I got right to the edge of my glans, I found the place it originated from. 

My penis was covered with a yellow, clay like substance. At first I thought it was normal, but then the smell hit me. I realized what had happened. When I was younger, my dad told me that to wash my dick, I should pull the foreskin back. And I did, or so I thought. 

I have always washed my dick by pulling back the foreskin just slightly (until it uncovered just the tip of my glans). I thought that was just fine and I never really thought anything of it. 

I have also been sexually active while this shit was probably in there, but never more than once with the same girl. Weird coincidence. 

Anyway, I'm realising all this while still standing at the urinal at work. I tried to peel the loose pieces off, and they let go pretty easy. The biggest pieces are still stuck to my dick, it looks pretty much like they're continents. I put my dick in the sink and turned the faucet on, hoping I could wash the big plaques off. I couldn't, my dick was sensitive as hell and the pieces are stuck. 

I'm about to go in the shower and peel at it with q-tips and my fingers until it's clean, and I plan on washing my dick better in the future. I hope that what I've accumulated right now doesn't lead to any serious issues. 

TL;DR: haven't washed my dick properly in 19 years, but I wasn't aware. Now my dick has a crusty smegma layer that I'm going to have to peel off.

Edit: I just stood in the shower for 20 minutes getting bits and pieces off. Most of it is behind the hood so to speak, and I can get that lose quite easily, however, some of it is on my glans and I can't get it loose for the life of me. I nearly fainted for real when I tried to scrub it off. Anyone know of a method to get it off?

Edit for all the other guys that have made the same mistake as me: I've done my research on this phenomenon now, and pretty much all the trustworthy sources I've read say to do the following:

- wash daily with mild soap (for the rest of your live)

- don't use cloth/q-tips/hands to scrub it off, just keep washing with soap daily until it's gone

- if it doesn't get cleaned by washing with soap: go to doctor

Edit: why the fuck are so many people asking for pictures. I thought I was the nasty one here."

This didn’t happen today, but I’m ready to tell the story now.

When my husband and I got together he had found a old, empty camera we started testing. We bought some film rolles and took some pictures here and there. After some time we got the images printed and they were mostly just bad pictures because the camera sucked. But we got some good pics from a festival, so we were happy. Time went on and we moved house a few times and then moved to another city. When we started unpacking we found a roll of pictures, and we thought it probably was from that old camera and it might be pictures from our honeymoon. We went to the camera shop to get the pictures printed instead of sending them in the mail. We had to wait one hour for them to finish the printing. So we just walked around the mall for a while. When one hour had passed, we walked back, paid and turned around, opened the wrapping and started looking at the pictures. The first picture was like a smack in the face, my husbands erect penis. Next one was me, naked and him doing naughty things to me.  
I could feel them looking at us. I felt like I was shrinking into the grund. I could not stop looking at the pictures while slowly realizing what I was looking at. I could not keep calm, so I just sprinted out, took the pictures and left my husband there. We could never go back there, not even to the mall, the only one in town, ever again. We moved home 6 months later.

TL;DR
Found an old roll of pictures and got them printed, turned out it was our home made porn."
u4y2k0,TIFU by discovering a dark secret from a sex tape I made,27569,0.8,1269,2022-04-16 19:11:44,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u4y2k0/tifu_by_discovering_a_dark_secret_from_a_sex_tape/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/u4y2k0/tifu_by_discovering_a_dark_secret_from_a_sex_tape/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"So about 2 years ago, I was still living in my strict religious parents' house and the only way for me to find a place to have sex was to use my dad's office. My dad owns a small advertising business so on some weekends, I'll use the excuse of needing better network and needing to concentrate to get the keys to the office and have the girl meet me there. I know he and his staff never come to work on the weekend.  
So I was with this girl at the time and she was freaky af and asked if I had ever made a sex tape. I had, but as a gee, I knew the correct answer at that point was no, and once I said that, she pulled out my phone and placed it somewhere and we started to get freaky. I jerked off to it a couple of times after that at home (still my parent's house) before it became stale and I hid it and never really got back to it.  


2 years later and I'm now living in my own house and I have a girlfriend who's out of town for a few months. I was telling her about the sex tape and she didn't like that I still had it and told me to delete it. I decided to give it one last jerk off before deleting it, so I hit a blunt, plugged in my headphones and started watching like I had done a couple of times years before. It was late at night. I started to beat myself off, listening to this girl moan over the background noise of a movie we were playing to mask our noise... till I heard a deep voice (we'll pretend my name is Manny) in my head say clear as day ""Manny why? Why??""  
I jumped out of my chair. My door was locked. No one was in the house with me. I was panicking. Was this my conscience talking??? Is my girlfriend a witch??? Is this because I'm watching a video she doesn't want me to watch?? I'm panicking as hell becuase it fucking scared me how clear the voice was. I wanted to watch the video again, but I honestly was too scared so I walked around the house for a bit, just to let the highness fade, in case that was what was responsible for me hearing voices.  
Once I was a little sober (still very shaken up) I decided to start the video from the beginning but to focus this time. So I sat in my chair, dick in my pants (it definitely had no interest in rising again), headphones on, studying this video like it's my finals. While listening, I noticed that while I was blowing her back out, there was a little ruckus in the background separate from the direction the movie sound was coming from. My ears perked up. It was a conversation in the background. Someone had opened the office door

""Oh the lights are on. Is Manny in the office.""  
""I think so, the TV is on.""  
\*some silence  
""Oh my God! Manny! Oh my God, why?""   
""Why? Manny? Why??""

From the voices, I could tell one of them was my dad. I can only imagine the other person was my mum but I can't confirm because it was a bit further back. I have no idea what they were doing in the office that day but they definitely walked in on me, their good little boy, fucking a girl like an animal. And from the audio, they seemed to have stuck around a while after that (weird). This girl and I were absolutely lost in our oxytocin world, completely clueless that we had spectators.   
I must have missed it all those times I jerked off to it because I never jerked off with both earphones on in my parent's house (always gotta be alert) and the TV noise just drowned the background sound then.   
The coincidence is still baffling to me because I would have never found out if this girl hadn't suggested we make a sex tape. My parents definitely never mentioned anything to me about it. A lot of shit started to make sense because that was around the period where they clamped down on my freedom (which eventually led to me leaving the house) and started becoming hostile to me.   
The hardest part was explaining to my girlfriend the discovery I had just made. ""Hey babe, you won't believe what I found in the sex tape you told me to delete"".  


TL;DR: Watched a sex tape years after making it only to discover that my parents had walked in on me having sex while I was making it.

Edit 1: Thanks to Reddit, I now have the image of my dad being there with someone who wasn’t my mum to do the same thing. Unlikely though because the person would have to be very familiar with me to have the kind of conversation she was having with my dad. No such person. 

Edit 2: I’m a trash person for watching it again while with my girl. For context though, I’m a sex addict who hadn’t gone two days without sex in about a year till I quit cold turkey to start a relationship with someone who I wouldn’t be able to see for about 4 months. It didn’t seem like a smart decision seeing I was bound to fail, but I made it because I lucked out with someone who truly truly understands me. Sorry to disappoint the few of you hoping she left me. She didn’t. And when she sees this, I hope she knows I’m forever grateful to have her."
kny49o,TIFU by leaving a real Christmas tree in my apartment until May.,27574,0.84,791,2021-01-01 02:38:20,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kny49o/tifu_by_leaving_a_real_christmas_tree_in_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kny49o/tifu_by_leaving_a_real_christmas_tree_in_my/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I actually fucked up 8 years ago, but time has worn down my pride enough that I'm willing to finally share this story with the world. 

It was recently suggested to me that I leave my Christmas tree up a little longer in order to further enjoy the cheeriness it brings to the living room. This is an easy thing to suggest when you haven't seen the things I've seen. When you haven't done the things that my boyfriend and I have done. You see, when you have one year when you leave your tree up until May, that experience changes you. It changes Christmas forever.

We have always used real trees as opposed to artificial ones, which means they need to be disposed of after the holidays. Back when we lived in an apartment they had a small window of time when you could leave the tree by the curb and they would haul it away for you. Unfortunately we missed that window, which turned into weeks and weeks of pretending the tree just... didn't exist. Sure the ornaments came down, but the skeletal remains of Christmas stood in our living room as a monument to our evasion of basic responsibilities. 

One day, in late February or so, we realized we could be having friends over for dinner. We thought, ""Oh my god. We can't let people know we still have this tree!"" So we did what any logical couple would do and we hid it in the closet with a white blanket over it. You can imagine how terrifying it was in the beginning when you would get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and see an 8 foot tall Christmas tree ghost looming in the doorway.

I don't know what the final straw was. Maybe it was the storage space we were losing by having a massive cloaked Douglas fir in our closet. Maybe it was that we missed using the blanket that had taken on a new purpose in life. Whatever it was, we knew we couldn't avoid this issue any longer. The problem of how to dispose of the tree still existed. We couldn't leave it at the curb, and we knew wherever we took it, it was going to leave a breadcrumb trail of humiliation straight to our doorstep. 

That's when the saw came out.

Into the wee hours of the night we carefully disassembled the tree until it was compact enough to fit into a cardboard box. By 2am we were covered in sweat and sap, but we were able to stealthily discard the box in a nearby dumpster. On that day, we vowed to never again let the disposal of the Christmas tree become an episode of Forensic Files. 

And now my shameful past is out in the open for the internet to enjoy. Happy New Year, all!

TL:DR - Holiday procrastination took a turn for the worse when my apartment became botanical Dexter scene. Also Happy New Year. :)"
bt2su3,TIFU by drinking peanut butter,27565,0.92,1467,2019-05-26 07:58:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bt2su3/tifu_by_drinking_peanut_butter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bt2su3/tifu_by_drinking_peanut_butter/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Quick statement, This isn't my account, but u/TheGemScout is a close friend of mine and since I don't use reddit I figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

So lets preface this. There's an episode of Two & a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. 

So I'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend Mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. We see that fateful scene and Mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

Two things before we proceed:

1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. While it's apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I'm allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.

Knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I'm going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.

So my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

Once He's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here's where my fuckup begins:

I drink coffee often, so I'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.

Actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It's VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn't get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I'm thinking ""I'm choking on lava"" and ""I really hope I don't die because of the one time I eat peanut butter""

In my suffering I finally stammer out ""Take me to the ER"" and his face Immediately changed
 
I go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I've got some pretty severe burns.

Flash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I'm still in constant pain. I can't taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

FML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you'll end up like me.


TL;DR: Got dared to drink melted peanut butter. Slammed it down to avoid Taste. Hot peanut butter is Basically Napalm and Hot PB + Mouth = Second Degree Burns."
ji6afe,TIFU when I didn't beat my wife after she won a football video game against me,27560,0.86,1231,2020-10-26 07:43:44,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ji6afe/tifu_when_i_didnt_beat_my_wife_after_she_won_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ji6afe/tifu_when_i_didnt_beat_my_wife_after_she_won_a/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,,False,"\[Obligatory this happened 6 years ago post notice.\]

TLDR: Wife pulls off an unbelievable video game upset on me; I yell at her and a tickle fight ensues, COPs come and I have to convince them tickle fight =/= real fight.

It's a random Tuesday evening, and the wife and I have dinner plans to meet up with friends with some time to kill before we have to leave, so we decide to play a game of Madden on Playstation in our little 1 BR Apartment with neighbors on both sides and below us. I'm winning towards the end of the game but she gets a touchdown to put the game within 2. She does an onside kick and recovers it with literally two seconds left at the end of the play; I'm starting to sweat that she somehow pulls off some miraculous Hail Mary and wins. She ends up selecting a field goal and I'm feeling relieved; the wind is against her and it's a 60+ yard field goal (for non football people, the record is 64 yards). She nails it perfectly and wins.

I jump off the couch and am yell: ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU JOKING? THIS IS BULLSH\*T! I'M GOING TO F\*CKING KILL YOU!"" She's cracking up laughing and I start tickling her. She runs into the bedroom and I yell something like ""YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME! I'M GOING TO GET YOU!"" I tickle her maybe 1-2 minutes more on our bed as she's cracking up/crying/yelling stop, but totally OK and within our normal boundaries of fun. We stop and she tells me she needs to get ready and starts heading into the bathroom to put on makeup.

By this point, maybe 5-10 minutes later, I've changed clothes, and am watching some TV when I hear a very loud, confident, series of knocks on the door. I open up, and SURPRISE, it's two police officers: one man and one woman.

Male cop: ""Good evening. Do you know why we are here?""

Me: ""I think so, and you're never going to believe me, but I can explain.""

Female cop: ""Is there a woman in this apartment, may I speak with her?""

Me: ""Yes, I am sure my wife will be willing to speak with you, she's in the restroom around the corner getting ready for dinner.""

Male cop: ""what do you think we are here for?""

Me: ""I think one of my neighbors probably heard me yell at my wife and chase her into the next room as she screamed. In reality, it was a tickle fight after she beat me in a video game.""

Male cop: ""A tickle fight. Uh-huh. And what did you yell at her?""

Me: ""I said I was going to kill her, but it was really a joke, I promise, really, all I did after that was tickle her for a minute or two.""

Male cop: ""Where did you plan on going to dinner?""

(Feeling trashy saying this as someone who is suspected of spousal abuse) Me: ""Hooters. We are meeting friends at Hooters for wing night.""

Male cop: ""May I take a look around?""

Me: ""Yes.""

He searches around, finds a broken vase in our recycle bin and asks about it. About 3-4 minutes later in what felt like an eternity, the female cop comes out and says: ""what did you hear?""

Male cop: ""Tickle fight.""

Female cop: ""Tickle fight."" She belts out one or two chuckles.

Me (weight of the world off my shoulders)

Male cop: ""alright, well, thanks for letting us come in and investigate, you know it's just our jobs and we have to take this kind of thing seriously...""

Me: ""yes, yes, I totally understand and am not mad; just have to repair a relationship with our neighbors who think I beat my wife now...""

After they left, my wife told me the cop she spoke with was begging her to admit it that I was hurting her and she was covering her bruises with makeup, more like ""hey, you're safe now, we got him, you can tell me the truth."" I get why they do this, but thank God my wife was insistent and confident in her speech that I was not in fact beating her.

We hadn't met our downstairs neighbors yet at that point, just a friendly wave out the door on the way to work each morning, but met them a few weeks later at a pool party the complex had. After some small talk, I just broke the ice and said: ""hey, just so you know, I think you guys must have called the police on me a few weeks back. I appreciate you called the police - I can understand how from your apartment, you just heard me yell 'I'm going to kill you!' followed by two people running followed by screaming. Just so you know, it was a tickle fight and nothing else. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Ultimately, you guys did the right thing."" I got the feeling they were a little skittish, but overall grateful that I told them that. We remained on friendly terms but lost touch after we moved out of that complex.

TLDR: Wife pulls off an unbelievable video game upset on me; I yell at her and a tickle fight ensues, COPs come and I have to convince them tickle fight =/= real fight.

Edits:

1. I am off to bed now but will try responding more tomorrow.
2. Yes, I know the title of the story raises eyebrows and makes people interested to read more. That's the point of a good title in my opinion and I've seen this technique used many times on this subreddit. 
3. Thanks for all the love - before this, I think I had gotten 2 awards ever. 
4. I am pretty thrilled with reddit right now - definitely thought there would be a lot more trolls than there were. 
5. Thanks for all the advice on dealing with police. In my opinion, there are times where I think it's time to be a little bit more argumentative with them and times when it's probably in everyone's best interest to cooperate and defuse the situation. I think I smartly chose the latter in this case. FWIW, this occurred in a major urban area in the U.S. and I think it demonstrates that cops, as a whole, are generally pretty professional and genuinely just interested in making their communities safer. Without wading into politics, yes, I recognize that police reform is required in the U.S. and support many of those efforts too. "
a5ya70,TIFU by trying to make myself last longer during sex.,27531,0.8,902,2018-12-14 03:38:47,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a5ya70/tifu_by_trying_to_make_myself_last_longer_during/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a5ya70/tifu_by_trying_to_make_myself_last_longer_during/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,True,False,False," This happened earlier this week and I’m still processing it. Also, throwaway because I don’t want my grandkids to find this one day. 

My longtime girlfriend had just completed her time of the month, and we were ready to engage in some heated sexual activity. We’re both going through rather busy times in our life right now, so sex doesn’t come as often as it should, but enough to fulfill our needs. Now, the past few weeks I’ve been helping (doing) my GF do homework for one of her online classes. Because of this, she realized she owed me and decided to pay me by way of sexual favors. Unethical? Maybe, but I’m not complaining. So, she begins to initiate foreplay and start to enjoy one of the better blow jobs of my life. She does her thing for a while and I stop her a few times before I hit her with that high fructose porn syrup. After edging a few times, I decide to return the favor and go down on here. I do my thing, she does hers, and now back to me. Well, by this time we’re about an hour in and she starts to get tired. I finally comply with her and prepare to unleash my homemade protein shake. However, because I have delayed the inevitable for so long, she is taking breaks every few licks of the tootsie pop. The next four events happen all simultaneously. I let my lover know its time, she comes up for a breather, my Johnson flops down on my stomach (I’m on my back), and I treat myself to a very salty penis colada. It. Was. Everywhere. A catastrophic and life-changing event. I, and nor should you, ever take those cum shot compilations for granted. Those girls are troopers. 

TL;DR – I was edging during oral with my girlfriend. She got tired and took a break. I climaxed all over my face. 

Edit: Man y'all are wild. Thanks for the platinum, gold, and silver. Happy Holidays, may snow fall on all of your faces."
cilu55,TIFU by ripping my anus open,27499,0.88,1993,2019-07-28 01:01:46,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cilu55/tifu_by_ripping_my_anus_open/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cilu55/tifu_by_ripping_my_anus_open/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,False,False,"
The following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

Me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.

Because we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

We went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

I awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.

The worst part was that I couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

A painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

Sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

For all you sickos:

Dimensions: Difficult to say. Closer to Randy's first record attempt than I would be comfortable disclosing.

Courics: I don't know, I forgot to contact the European Fecal Standards team for verification. I would say more than one, less than four.

Color: Dark. I drink a lot of coffee.

Texture: Like a sock filled with broken marbles. 

TL;DR Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. AMA

Edit: I'm sorry Reddit, I didn't take a photo. I wish I did. I wish I could go back in time and fix this...wait, no I don't. I don't want this to turn into a Reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no I will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. Sorry. I also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.

For all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. My girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. Thank you all for the advice. She and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. How nice..."
ki3w9o,TIFU by loosing my bowels in the parking lot storm drain of my local supermarket...NSFW,27500,0.9,1597,2020-12-22 17:22:31,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ki3w9o/tifu_by_loosing_my_bowels_in_the_parking_lot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ki3w9o/tifu_by_loosing_my_bowels_in_the_parking_lot/,self.tifu,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"O my gawd this is so embarrassing and literally happened about 30 minutes ago. 

So I have bowel issues (clearly) and I range between super constipation or the exact opposite. Im (39F) and was having the plugged up issue for the last couple of days and tonight got to the point where something HAD to be done. 

I had the urge but was way too backed up. So decide to drive the 2 miles to the 24/7 grocery store to get some suppositories or miralax or anything. 

This is all happening at 3am so im like okay, not many people will be there and I can run in and out and be back home in 5 minutes and get some sweet relief.

As I'm driving I suddenly feel like my ass is going to give birth! I'm really close to the store and im like FUCK I cannot make it home so i plan in my head how I'll get in the store and run to the bathroom, however, the bathroom is all the way at the back of store and its a pretty big store, at this point my brown baby is crowning and im in tears because i know as soon as I stand up I will loose it all, literally and i don't wanna shit myself in my car - god that would never smell right again!

Anyways, at this point I am sweating, crying, panting, doing the fucking labor breathing exercises knowing its about to happen and im speeding through the parking lot planning to just pull behind the store and go in some bushes but low and behold all of the delivery trucks are there delivering their bread and god knows what else, now im really panicking and figuring at this point I don't care if someone sees me because all I can think is getting this creature out of my body.  I fly past the trucks and to the side of the store, this area was pretty desolate, at least i hope, I jump out of the car, rip my pants down, and squat over the grated storm drain and I kid you not, instantly I let loose and had the biggest hugest shit in all of my 39 years. At this point I didn't care if anyone did see because I was feeling so relieved. 

I finish in like 20 seconds and go to stand up but realize I have no tissue or wet wipes so I have to pull my pants up and drive home sitting sideways so my poopy pants don't touch my seat. Before I leave I look at the storm drain, thanking it for saving my life and realize that the 💩 didn't even go down it was semi hard and tall as hell (it was at least 4 days worth and freaking at least 5 pounds) !-!!!!

I saved a few dollars because I didn't need the meds anymore so I guess that's the upside. Came home and jumped in the shower and had to share here because well I really fucked up today.

TL;DR - super constipated, drove to store to get meds and meanwhile realized I was going to shit myself so pulled in parking lot and shit in storm drain. Middle of night no TP drove home with shitty pants.

Edit: LOSING! Spelling. Sorry to the spelling police. I wrote this shit at 4 am and was tired and traumatized so please forgive my fuck up.....that is all"
dahkm0,TIFU picking up the wrong person from the airport and getting pulled over at gun point by the Police.,27489,0.94,1087,2019-09-28 21:09:17,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dahkm0/tifu_picking_up_the_wrong_person_from_the_airport/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/dahkm0/tifu_picking_up_the_wrong_person_from_the_airport/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,,False,"I live near a smaller airport and I help out at the local Turkish community center.  I’m white but I go to a free dinner they do every other Thursday and it is amazing, so I chose to volunteer every once in a while.   Set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. I’ve met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.

So last week, I was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from Turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. I was told she knew little to no English and I wasn’t the first choice to go get her, I was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. 

They give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. Whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, I set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.

I pull up to the international gate and immediately an Eastern European woman standing all alone. I get out with my sign that says ‘Demir’ and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. Last name? Check. Eastern European? Check. Not much English? Check. can’t believe my luck!!

I pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the Turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  About 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. She calls someone and frantically speaks in Turkish. I’m thinking she left something on the plane or at home. I felt bad but I couldn’t do anything about it at the time, I was driving in the freeway.

10 minutes later, I’m off the freeway and a cop passes. He immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and I pull over. At this point I’m freaking out and when I turn around, I see the lady has Uber out and upon further inspection, I’m not the Uber driver.....

The cop tells me to get out and I am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. My head hurts from the slam against the ground and I’m fully aware of the kidnapping situation I’m in. 

After about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in Turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  I ask him to use my phone to contact the Turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. 

Little did I know ‘Demir’ is one of the most common surnames in all of Turkey. So when the lady(her first trip to america) see that I have her name, she figures I’m the Uber driver ready to pick her up. She knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. My heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real ‘Demir’ pulls up. 

After a discussion that I’m not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. I am in disbelief as of to what just happened and I definitely sweated through my entire outfit. We get back to the Turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. Everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. I got drunk drunk. 

TL;DR by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. First names count, people!!!

Edit: detained, not arrested. Also, talking with Turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. Eastern is too white, middle is bad in America, so most of them just say they are from Turkey."

A little backstory, I have dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. Good news; I'm better now and I laugh about it. I was better back then too.

Also worth mentioning I'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.

So back to the fuck-up, a short story I was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. I bet you can see where this is going.. So I start drafting the letter and before I finish it with the dating and stuff I get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so I get out saying very little to my mom.

After leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *Shocker* I left my phone at home. (It's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare I take it with me unless I'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees ""my"" suicide note.

She gets scared and calls my dad. Soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. I walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. After a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but I felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.


TL;DR: Me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking I killed myself, I show up eating ice cream and get scolded. Generally felt terrible


Edit: wow a lot of you want to read the horrible piece of fiction I wrote back then, I can't find the original story but I'll try to rewrite from memory in the morning!

Edit2: ah yes the good old severe suicide "
ta60u1,TIFU by saying that my neighbors daughters are hot,27455,0.91,1379,2022-03-09 17:13:22,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ta60u1/tifu_by_saying_that_my_neighbors_daughters_are_hot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ta60u1/tifu_by_saying_that_my_neighbors_daughters_are_hot/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I (M, 33) live in Quebec, Canada. Here the official language is French, but almost everyone speaks English too.

The other day I was shoveling snow on my driveway and my neighbor (F ~35) was there too, removing snow from her car.

We share a driveway and we are very friendly. We always help each other and exchange gifts. I really love having them as neighbors.

Their family configuration is: mother, two daughters, one son and a father. But dad and mom are divorced. So on this day I finally met the father.

So he approached me talking in French, and I kinda can speak French, so I tried to maintain the conversation in French to be respectful. He said ""my daughters said you are a very good neighbor (mes filles m'on dit que tu est un très bon voisin)"" or something along these lines. 

I replied: merci! Elles sont très bonnes aussi !
I thought that meant ""thank you, they are very good too!

Again, my French is very limited. 

That actually means ""yes, they are very hot too""
Or ""very good to f*ck""

He started speaking English, and we had a pleasant conversation.

Weeks later I watch a video about the worst mistakes you can make in French. This was #1.

So now I know that I said to a Muslim father that they daughters and ex wife are hot.

TL;DR: my French speaking skills suck and I said to a man that his ex-wife and daughters are hot when I'm trying to say that they are very good (elles sont très bonnes, if you speak any French).

EDIT 1: some people from Quebec sent me messages saying that this is a ""France french"" expression (or metropolitan french). That is a relief, but not that much. Because I guess they learnt French from France, because they are from Lebanon."

I’m in a children’s hospital with my wife and son because he’s been having severe asthma issues.

My wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and I’ve just been sitting in one of the chairs. As people kept coming in, I noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. I figured I had some food on my face or something and didn’t think too much of it.

Suddenly, I’m sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, “What’s that between your legs?”

I look down, and there’s a pink ball between my legs. Confusion quickly turns to shock as I realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. One of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

I don’t have a spare pair of pants here, so now I’m just sitting with my legs tightly together like I’m wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn’t stay here long.

TL;DR I found out I had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.

**EDIT: Most common question is about my undergarments. I was indeed wearing boxers. My testicle came out the bottom of them.**

EDIT2: Wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, I can’t do testy puns too?). Thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! I had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.

**EDIT3: I GOT PANTS! As several people suggested, I explained my predicament to the nurse, and she hooked me up with a pair of scrub pants. They’ll make excellent pajama pants.**

And thank you for another coconut! I have two now! How fitting. Thank you, kind stranger.

EDIT4: Another coconut (three nuts now—one can fall out, and I still have two left) and a silver. Thank you again!

EDIT5: Popped my gold cherry. Guess everything is popping for me today. Thank you, internet stranger!

**EDIT6: Dammit! Replacement pants are actually worse than original pants. [Here’s me wearing them on top of my pants](https://imgur.com/a/xI6y80B). The “fly” makes no sense. Wife confirms it.**

EDIT7: Thank you to /u/jedberg for evening out my balls at two pairs and another kind stranger for more silver!

**LAST EVER EDIT: Son is doing better. We can hopefully leave tomorrow. My ball has been staying put in two sets of pants. Thank you for all the love and support everyone. Sorry for going a little (lot) edit crazy. Just overwhelmed by all the support.**"

I’m not sure why this post blew up the way it did but seven hours and a million views later, I have found out there are *MANY* Garfield cup owners, users, and enjoyers and I want to say thank you for checking out this post — I appreciate all of you!

When I made this post, I wasn’t expecting it to get to where it is at but if you have a Garfie cup like me, you’re probably safe as long as you’re not licking the damn paint haha — don’t lick the paint and make sure your print it still laminated/sealed!

Use the cup at your own disposal for whatever you please and keep doing what you do, you wonderful people :)

I’m planning on making a YouTube video about this situation and the cups in a week or so thanks to you all and I really do hope you enjoy — I’ll still be in the thread chatting but it’s been an adventure!"
vi4kpy,TIFU by asking for some hardcore bdsm from my boyfriend. And now I think I’m mentally scarred.,27370,0.77,2719,2022-06-22 18:22:54,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vi4kpy/tifu_by_asking_for_some_hardcore_bdsm_from_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vi4kpy/tifu_by_asking_for_some_hardcore_bdsm_from_my/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"I am in no way shape or form blaming my bf, but I think I mentally scarred myself. I’ve been watching some pretty crazy shit recently, and I had the smart idea to try something out. I asked him if he could preform certain acts of BDSM with my consent. I wasn’t abused as a kid or anything. Idk, porn just glorified it enough to make me curious. We had safe words and everything. And when we did the deed, I was… conflicted to say the least. It was arousing, don’t get me wrong. But fuck, it also left me feeling helpless. I know it was kind of the point, but I was not prepared. I didn’t ask to stop because I was still getting off on it.

My bf was very against it at first since he was as vanilla as a person can be. but he said if I really wanted to try, he’d be up for it. The thing was, he actually enjoyed it. Like really enjoyed it. 

Anyways afterwards, I let him know that it wasn’t as fun as I’d thought it would be and that we wouldn’t do it again. He was understanding of course. But for some reason, I was kind of unnerved that he was really into it. And the weeks afterwards, I just kept thinking of how helpless. I’ve been less intimate with my boyfriend since then. Every time he touches me to initiate, I recoil. And every time I think of being intimate with him, I think of that night.

My boyfriend has been very supportive with me, saying it’s no big deal if we weren’t intimate. Just as long as I feel comfortable. The thing is, I’m not. He doesn’t know that this has been festering inside me and I actually feel like shit for feeling like this. It seems totally unfair to tell him about this because, like I literally asked for bdsm specifically! He’d feel like a total piece of shit for doing what I asked. It’s not his fault I woke some kink in him. 

Anyways, I think I’m gonna spend money on therapy to fix this myself, thanks for listening Reddit

TLDR: Asked my bf to be very rough with me during sex. It mentally scarred me and I feel like shit for feeling like shit. Can’t tell my bf because it’ll make him feel like shit because I’m a piece of shit for thinking it would be hot. So I’m going to therapy.

Edit: Hi! Shit. Didn’t expect this to blow up as big as it did. There is no way I’ll be able to read every comment, but I want to thank all of you! Even the “questionable” comments for the laughs. I just want to reiterate that I don’t blame my boyfriend at all. In fact I’m going to just up and tell him my feelings and apologize for being somewhat cold these last few weeks. We’re generally pretty good about communicating since we’ve been together for years. But idk, there’s something deeply personal about opening up about this. Like I know it’s hypocritical to be upset. But I can’t just turn off my anxiety. And I know he’s anxious about it too, but doesn’t want to open up either in fear of hurting my feelings too. That’s why I’ll just rip off the band aid. Anyways thanks again Reddit! And also sorting by controversial gave me some good laughs just from the insanity of a certain group of people lmao. I hope you guys find someone that loves you.

Edit 2: I let him in on the inner workings of my mind the other day. I made it very clear that I am not voluntarily trying to hold it against it. Rather it the result of some trauma that I brought upon myself for my lack of preparation. I apologized for being relatively cold for the last weeks, and we made it. He knew something was up and felt really bad, and I reassured it it was all on me. I showed him the Reddit post just for transparency. Anyways, we’re both gonna go to therapy to deal with any trauma induced symptoms. Because that’s what it is, symptoms that I want to get treated. It isn’t me, nor do I want to be dictated by it. Anyways, have a lovely day peeps! And to all the people at the top of controversial sort, I mean it. I hope you find someone that will love you ❤️"

I chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking I'd get a cute photo of them together.

I get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. She doesn't care, but hey, mission accomplished. 

Fast forward 6 hrs and I'm playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. I suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. She's picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. 

I take it away from her but she doesn't stop howling. Her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. I think she thought it was a dead cat. I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won't let me near her.

I feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.

Tldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. She thought I brought her a dead cat and freaked out.

EDIT: By request, I'm paying the cat tax. This is Mushroom and she's 9 years old. I adopted her two weeks ago after fostering her for a couple months.

Edit 2: For people asking if she's okay, when I woke up this morning she was sleeping on my shoulder like always so I think she's forgiven me. However, I'm never bringing a cat effigy into the apartment again. Thanks for caring about my cat guys!!"
heuiao,TIFU by not watering my tomatoes and underestimating physics,27359,0.89,715,2020-06-24 10:18:05,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/heuiao/tifu_by_not_watering_my_tomatoes_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/heuiao/tifu_by_not_watering_my_tomatoes_and/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This happened about thirty minutes ago. So I've been Covid gardening since March, growing stuff from seeds, and my tomatoes are monsters. Six feet high and still going. Temps have been in the upper 90's, so I need to water them twice a day. I check their condition, note they do need water, then see an actual TOMATO OMG. Since this is the first edible thing I've seen after three months of backbreaking work, I'm understandably excited. I lean forward to examine said first glorious tomato. As I do, my bright red hair swings into eyeball range, and I see a GIANT FUCKING WASP tangled in it. Now, in hindsight it probably was normal-sized, but as it was right in front of my eyeball, I promise you it looked gargantuan.

The wasp is, as you can imagine, not terribly pleased to be trapped in the thickets of my hair. I do not panic, however. I grab the base of that hank of hair and hold it while still leaning forward so the angry little bastard doesn't swing directly into my face. I go into problem-solving mode. The wasp does not wish to be in my hair-I do not wish the wasp to be in my hair. Yet, I sense, cooperation will not be possible. I instead enlist physics as my helper and attempt to fling the little fucker free by cracking my hair like a whip. Alas for my B grade in PH 221--Physics decided it is not my bitch today. I whip the angry little bastard RIGHT DOWN THE CLEAVAGE OF MY TANK TOP.

Small aside: I have more cleavage-related woes than any other two women I know. It is a black hole for bad luck. And on one memorable occasion, sushi from across a crowded restaurant. A TALE FOR LATER. 

Having switched directly from ""not panicking I can solve this"" to ""panicking now I HAVE A WASP IN MY BOOBS,"" I yank the neck of my tank top forward in an attempt to keep the buzzing motherfucker from digging a hole in my fun bags. Luckily, the wasp appeared to watch a lot of fashion television and was instead attacking my tank top. I mean, I get it. No one wants to be flung into leaf green ribbed polyester. It is so last summer. 

Having learned absolutely nothing from my previous flirtation with centripetal force, I again attempt to whip the little fucker free. Naturally, it goes directly into my face. I slap it away with my free hand, and it goes back into my cleavage. But fortunately this time it hits my boob at such an angle that it bounces out to freedom!

Still bent forward and holding my tank top's neck at least a foot from me, I crow in victory and straighten up, immediately making awkward eye contact with the three stunned construction workers in my neighbor's back yard. No, I was not wearing a bra. So yeah, I just flashed those poor men with leaning forward middle-aged dangle boobs. Fluttering like pennants in the wind. Not the most flattering angle. 

Did I attempt to explain my entirely reasonable circumstances to those baffled people? No, I did not. I just scuttled inside like the fuck-up I am, and now I can never go outside again and my tomatoes still need to be watered. But I pinged that little winged bastard like a backhand at Wimbledon and I did NOT get stung, so not entirely a loss? I dunno.

tl;dr: Monster tomatoes lead to cleavage wasp, and my titty semaphore is not understood by baffled bystanders.

Edit: Wow, I crashed and went to bed after reading a few very nice comments that made my night, and woke up to a very full inbox. Thank you! Also, yes I snuck out after dark to water the tomatoes, they are going to be fine! I watered them again this morning. There are no construction people over at my neighbor's yet, but they appear to be building a fence, so I'm going back inside before they come back and continue with that.

q18xqv,TIFU by giving an homeless girl my room at an hotel,27360,0.86,2996,2021-10-04 21:57:18,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/q18xqv/tifu_by_giving_an_homeless_girl_my_room_at_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/q18xqv/tifu_by_giving_an_homeless_girl_my_room_at_an/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Over the weekend I was staying at a popular UK chain hotel and thought I was going to be there until Sunday night. Well 1pm comes and I get back to the hotel early from having lunch and it turns out that they have a strict checkout time of 12pm to get your money back and I don’t really want to stay there all day by myself miles away just for the sake of it. 

Over in the corner of the hotel lobby was a little lounge area with a sofa and some armchairs. There was a girl who must not have been much older than 18 or so asleep on the sofa and you could tell from her appearance that she was sleeping rough and had come inside out of the rain. The hotel reception staff walked over to her and were asking her to leave, which I understand, but I felt horrible for her. I followed her out into the car park and offered her my room key if she promised not to trash the room and as long as she checked out on time. She agreed and so I went on my way not really thinking much about it other than how she wouldn’t have to sleep outside in the rain. 

I spoke to my brother later on and he informed me that if something bad happened to her in the room then it would be on me, so I was panicked all last night. I tried calling the hotel to tell them of the situation but couldn’t get through. Well they called me this morning and it turns out that she didn’t only trash the room, but that she also urinated in the hallway, tried to smash the vending machine and was in general a disturbance to other guests. The hotel informed me that I’d have to pay for any damage and the reception lady gave me a very stern lecture about why they don’t just give people rooms when they show up like that. Lesson learned, but at least an 18 year old girl didn’t have to sleep outside in the rain and be open to any number of dangerous situations for a night I suppose. 

TL;DR I was checking out of an hotel early and there was an homeless girl sleeping in the lobby. She was being moved on so I gave her my room key and let her have the room. She trashed it and now I have to pay for damages.

Edit: thank you so much for the awards guys! I’ve never had a big post on Reddit before so it’s hard to keep up, but I appreciate it!

UPDATE: It’s been months and i more or less forgot about this, but I received my bill today and it was £478 for damages and £210 for the room since it couldn’t be used for 2 days. I expected worse to be honest, but it’s still not great obviously."

On this particular day, BF had to leave before me. 

So I’m getting ready, and I notice something in his bathroom trash can. 

A pad wrapper. Pink. I already got my period this month, and mine are blue. He doesn’t have any female family/friends in the area that I know of. 

So I’m panicking inside. All day. I go to class and then to work and come back to his place. We’re eating the dinner that I cooked for him, and all the while I’ve been thinking about how to confront him. 

When we finish eating, I calmly say, “Okay, look, I’m not accusing you of anything. But I saw something and I need an explanation.”

I told him what I found this morning, and the fucker starts laughing. 

“Babe, go look at the shelf on top of my computer. No, seriously, go look.”

I go into his room. He points to a canister on the shelf. I open it. 

Who the hell owns pink cleaning wipes?

TL;DR thought I saw a pad wrapper in my boyfriend’s trash can but it was a cleaning wipe.

ETA: We’ve had a talk about this obviously, and he says I handled it well and understands me. I know this is Reddit, but I’m in therapy so y’all can stop with the unsolicited advice and takes on our relationship. Thanks!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I’ve had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don’t have them and I don’t want to see them again).

The truth is there isn’t much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

Our sex life is back to normal and I feel like I’ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

I thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

—

WHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?

Honestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I’m as bad as her.

HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?

Because I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

WAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?

No

YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG

2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.

As you can imagine, I’ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  

A DICK THAT BIG COULDN’T GET HARD

It certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you’re right.

HER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING

She probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I’ve been with. I guess you don’t know how vaginas work.

—

Someone told me that my original post was the most upvoted NSFW post in the history of Reddit. I don’t know if that’s true, but I guess that’s pretty cool.

vttdje,TIFU by thinking getting constant UTIs was normal.,27333,0.95,982,2022-07-08 02:48:50,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vttdje/tifu_by_thinking_getting_constant_utis_was_normal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/vttdje/tifu_by_thinking_getting_constant_utis_was_normal/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"Some backstory: I used to get a lot of UTIs. Like, _a lot_ a lot, no matter what I did. Boyfriend and I would both shower before sex, I would pee immediately after, I drank water like a camel, took urinary health supplements, everything I could think of. I would still get 8-12 of them a year, a couple of which turned into kidney infections and landed me in the hospital. I was constantly on antibiotics, and at one point I was prescribed an antibiotic to take every time after I had sex. It destroyed my gut bacteria and pH balance down there, and I was miserable and in pain constantly. 


I was told pretty much the same thing by every doctor I went to: I need to pee after sex, drink more water, etc. I told them I was already doing all of these things, and they said some women just get them more frequently than others for some reason.


The last time I ended up in the ER with a kidney infection, the kind ER doctor told me that in his 45+ years of practicing medicine, he had never seen a healthy young woman have that many UTIs. There is absolutely something wrong, and I need to see a specialist about it ASAP. 


Fast forward 4 weeks and a referral to a urologist later, my doctor runs a series of tests. One of these tests is a uroscopy which, if you’ve never had one, is where a very small camera is inserted into your bladder through your urethra and is just about as pleasant as it sounds. It didn’t take my doctor long to discover the cause of my constant UTIs: there was a growth/tumor in there. It had formed a pocket which the doctor said was collecting bacteria, contributing to both the frequency and severity of my UTIs being increased. 


Since there was no way to know if this was a birth defect, a benign growth, or literal cancer without a biopsy, surgery was scheduled immediately to have it removed. The biopsy found that it was not cancerous, which I am infinitely grateful for. Since recovering from surgery, I have not had a single UTI, have gotten off antibiotics, and am able to have a normal sex life with my boyfriend without the fear getting sent to the hospital. My fuck up is that I suffered for years and years instead of getting help, thinking that what I was going through was normal.


TL;DR My constant UTIs were being caused by a growth inside of my bladder, and I spent years suffering before getting treatment because I was told women getting frequent UTIs was normal."

A friend at the company privately messages me through WebEx, ""Dude what happened to your face?""  I thought it would be funny to reply with ""Good News!  I finally hit puberty!!!""  except that message wasn't private - it went to everyone on the call...  like everyone - without any context around it.

Technically, it's just a stand-alone Emergency Room, and if anybody needs further  treatment, they get sent to one of two or three ""real"" hospitals.

She's a nurse that just started working here, and I've just started getting  to know. She was telling me about her upcoming wedding today, and we  chatted for a little bit about her selling her old house, my marriage  jitters five years ago, and the like. It seemed very friendly, and I  could tell how excited she was for this wedding. She had kind things to  say about me and my story, but I took it as just friendly chatter instead of flirting.

I was sitting  at my desk, browsing reddit on one screen while the cameras are on the  other, and I saw movement in the triage room, which is odd because there  aren't any patients in the building. Nobody in the lobby either. It's  the nurse who's about to get married, who slips off her shoes. And  pants. And top. I could see she shaves her bikini area, and the lacy  bits on her bra, which is all she's wearing except socks. She steps onto  the scale, fiddles with her bra a little bit, and then steps back off  and gets dressed again.

Now my  heart is racing. I'm sick to my stomach; I can't believe what I just  saw. It feels gross to have intruded on something like that. What am I  supposed to do? I decide that what I'm not going to do is tell my  supervisor. I don't think there's a way for me to delete the video  footage, and I know that if my higher-ups know what to look for, they  can find it. I don't think they just browse everything randomly, though,  so if I don't draw attention to it, chances are good no one else will  see it. Right?

None of that was my  fault. What was my fault, is that I got her attention on her way out  the door and said something really stupid.

""Hey, good luck showing the house.""  
""Thanks!"" She smiled.  
""Hey,"" I hesitated. The anxiety started to choke me.  
""I don't know how to tell you this, but there are cameras in the triage room.""  


I  watched confusion make way to realization, followed by disgust. Utter  disgust. Anger, perhaps? I was still reeling and wondering how I  expected this news to be taken. I hadn't thought that far ahead.  


""I did not know that,"" she spat out, trying to look anywhere but at me.  


""I  won't tell anyone. Umm, good luck fitting in your wedding dress? See  you later."" I still don't know where in the everlasting hell that came  from. She left without saying anything more.

TL;DR ... I should have just suffered in silence with the knowledge of  what my co-worker's naked body looked like. The look of disgust on her  face is now burned in my face more than her nudity ever was.

I don't plan on telling anyone at work what I saw, but venting to reddit may help me get these emotions in check enough to sleep before my next shift. Tylenol PM will probably help, too.  


EDIT: I mentioned a lot of details about her state of undress, trying to get across the point that the [cameras had a pretty good shot](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA). I don't think I can pan or zoom, but I didn't have to. And she wasn't wearing any panties under her scrubs, hence the ""just bra and socks.""   


My only explanation for the ""Good luck fitting in your dress"" comment is that I was desperately trying to move the conversation forward in a positive direction. And that was the best explanation in my mind for her behavior, so it was the first thing my anxious brain caught hold of. It really wasn't supposed to be a fat joke because she is absolutely slim. Yes, I know I'm clueless. Hence why I'm in /r/TIFU.  


 I really didn't want to believe that she was flirting in our conversation, and that she would do it on purpose, but I left out the fact that our conversation directly before the incident started with me saying something along the lines of ""Hey, I played back the camera footage, and that creepy guest that didn't leave when the patient they were visiting left? Yeah, I made sure they left the building. They're gone."" Thirty minutes after that conversation, she is [standing directly under a camera and demonstrating that she's been going commando all night.](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA) The timing was slightly suspicious, but I didn't want to believe it.  


Although now a third option comes to mind. Being really slim and having a compulsion to weigh yourself at work... could that possibly indicate a former or current eating disorder? Now I'm even more of a jerk. 

I told my wife, and she was slightly embarrassed for the nurse and for me, but being a nurse herself, she's inserted enough catheters to not be phased by the human body too much. We still had sex before she went to bed and I went to work."

It started off with a subtle ""do you want the Turkey sausage instead"". At this point I'm thinking ""well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage"".  Admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because I'm pretty brown looking, I have a beard, and Arab and Desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. Let's be real, he damn sure didn't think I was Jewish (*funny story: I'm jewish enough to legally immigrate to Israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). 
But I didn't speak up. 
Well today I went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course I pipe up and said ""oh it's fine I'll just eat around it"" which is somewhat true: I don't actually like bacon and I really did just want the pancakes. I must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). Well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if I took the plate just to make it easier for him because then I'd be being a *bad Muslim* just to convenience him. Well then. 
This was the first time that he outright called me Muslim.
Did I come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? No, in fact I'm at my desk wondering what I'm going to do for Ramadan.


Edit:     

1. Thanks for the gold.           

2. The cafeteria guy is a really nice guy, loud, jokes around with everyone in such a way that every morning is almost like a group conversation between me, him, and the rest of the line. It's a great way to start a morning- the guy is very personable. The flipside is that the times where I might privately correct the matter are few and far between.           

3. *That Seinfeld interpretation was absolutely legendary.*          

4. I really wish I would have spelt *too* correctly.           

5. To everyone calling me a p\*ssy, wimp, etc: whatever makes you feel tough I guess. I had quite a bit more to say on the matter but frankly it just wasn't worth the drama.

>TL;DR    
TIFU up by being too shy to speak up and tell the cafeteria guy at my job that I wasn't Muslim, now I'm too deep in the lie, and have to roll with it until I have the courage and, more importantly, right setting to come clean. "

I had stayed the night at my boyfriends dorm, and so we were both crammed on his shitty dorm mattress. 

The night went by very peaceful. In the morning I woke up, stood up and stretched, and then headed out to the kitchen. I grabbed a glass of water and chugged it, and then checked my period tracker app. The app said I was a couple days late, so I decided to take a pregnancy test. 

I went to the bathroom, opened up the test, sat down and began to take it. When I looked at the test, the screen was completely distorted. I couldn’t read if it was positive or not, so I decided to try another one. 

I open a new test, sit down, and miraculously, have a lot more pee in me. I start peeing like a mad man. It is just FLOWING out of me onto the stick. It seems never ending. 

And then suddenly it stops. 

And I wake up. In my boyfriends tiny bed. With him sleeping soundly right next to me. A puddle of my piss spreading across the mattress like wildfire. 

It was on his sheets, comforter, and his shirt that I was wearing. Luckily I was able to wake him and get him to move before it reached him. 

The level of embarrassment I felt was insane. We took the sheets off and cleaned up, but I didn’t have a change of clothes so I had to put on yesterday’s dirty clothes and sit in shame. 

He’s been cracking bed wetter jokes all day now and I truly feel like I’ll never live this down. 

TLDR: dreamt I was taking a pregnancy test, actually pissed in my boyfriends bed.

Edit: I feel like some people are misunderstanding. My boyfriend “cracking bed wetter jokes” isn’t a bad/rude thing. I think it’s funny, and he’s a really great guy. He was completely understanding, helped me clean up and didn’t for a second make me feel like I should be ashamed. He tried to make me feel better about it, and then afterwards the jokes started. Now it’s sort of like an inside joke. This TIFU is lighthearted!"

So when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!

The night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

I get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.

Here's where it went south.

We're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, ""I got this.""  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying ""Oh, you don't have t-"". 

I cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a ""After you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

Without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

Maybe next time."

I don't know why, but it's something she's always been into, and she'll do weird shit like make me drink more water or eat celery if she wants to have a lot of sex later that day. I don't get it, but it's her thing. 

A few weeks back she went on a 10 day business trip. I wanted to surprise her when she got back so I ordered a supplement that's meant to help in that area. My plan was that the first time we had sex once she got back I would blow her away by shooting web like I was Spiderman fighting the Crazy 88s. Then she'd think I was the pinnacle of masculinity and would love me even more. Didn't work out like that. 

She got back last Friday and we didn't do anything special that night- just relaxed and slept. On Saturday morning I got everything ready for her to go to her niece's birthday party at my MIL's house- I wrapped the gifts, picked up some cupcakes, and even cleaned the house. I don't like my MIL and stay home from stuff there, so I figured I would make things easier for my wife since she had just gotten back from a long trip. Well, my loving wife decided to reward me. With a blowjob. 

She was all dressed up and ready to go (cute sundress, nice formal shoes, makeup and hair done), but sat me down on the couch beforehand and pulled my pants down. I debated telling her here whether or not I had been taking the supplements (I hadn't jerked off in about a week so I had no idea if they even worked) but decided not to. I meant to surprise her, and boy did I. 

So, to cut to the chase: I was about to finish and told her so. She just nodded and kept going. What a champ. Then I started to cum, and then I did again, and again, and again. 

It. just. kept. coming. 

At this point my wife threw herself back from me and did an imitation of Chewbacca fighting a swarm of hornets. She was screaming out a gurgled ""what the fuuuuuuuuck"" while pawing in front of her face. She started coughing and it got everywhere- her hair, dress, face- even the gift. 

She was already late so she didn't have enough time to change and get dressed up again. She threw on some jeans and a  nice shirt, rinsed her hair out and let it down, and went to the party. It should be noted that her eyes get red when she coughs a lot, and she was pretty tired from just getting back the night before. 

Well, an hour and a half later she sent me [these texts](https://imgur.com/a/nwy6It7). To be honest, I thought it was kind of hilarious (and so did my wife). My MIL is really religious and anal about everything and stuff like this can happen quite a bit. My wife doesn't even smoke. 

But, her mom ended up calling her later that day saying essentially ""if you're going to get high and can't even get ready for your nieces birthday party, then you can't come over at all"" and now wants to see her doing some type of rehab before having contact with her. Oof. 

TL;DR: Took a load boosting supplement, came like a fire hydrant and destroyed my wife’s personal appearance, MIL thought she was high because of it and now wife is banned from her house until she goes to rehab

Edit: fixed the TL;DR because apparently my previous one broke the Geneva convention. Lots of people are asking what the supplement is (seriously, I’ve gotten 100+ messages about dick pills, wtf reddit)- [this guy](https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nrou10/tifu_by_taking_a_load_boosting_supplement_and/h0i05qs/) caught me and put two and two together.

I (F 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.There are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when I am loaded with shopping bags, I can't help myself petting her.Today was no exception. I made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because I knew I wouldn't be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as I often do), I was trying to do everything with my right hand.

So I go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20's, kinda cute), like I normally do.While I'm helping him arrange all items in my bag, I followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that I wouldn't use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.Me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because God forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-Oh, I just stroke a kitty with that hand, so I try not to touch anything else before I wash my hands properly.Mind you, I said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in English.

He stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when I looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... Eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.Only then did it hit me what I said and how it must have sounded to him.I quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-Kitty. Cat, you know. A stray. Meow meow. (Yes, I really said that....\*cringe\*)

He made an ""Oooooh..."" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.

I think I might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \*facepalm\*

TL;DR: I accidentally woke somebody's dirty mind by making him think I've pet my kitty...

**EDIT**: Thank you so much for the platinum and silver, I just wanted to vent by sharing a mildly cringe-worthy story from my day with a healthy dose of self-irony. 

I didn't expect it to blow out like it did.   
I appreciate all the kind and funny comments, BUT I'm also shocked to see how far could some people twist my words into extremely dark connotations - I even saw comments about me being creepy, predatory etc, which is absurd.  
I know I shouldn't ""feed the trolls"" by engaging and reasoning, what reasoning when somebody posts an absurd comment meant solely to upset or offend, indeed.  
But seriously, those who suggested I was in any way deliberately inappropriate or had some hidden lewd agenda towards this guy - I suggest you read my post again carefully and then if you still think so, seek some professional help, because the issue is with you, not with me."

I thought it was weird to be randomly contacted, but the foundations of his idea I thought were really solid and had growth potential, so I organized a call to discuss details etc. He ended up not being able to attend that call, and when he reached out to reschedule the message just slipped through my inbox unread for a while. After all, it was just a young guy with big dreams, how many guys are out there saying they've got the next big startup idea? So a week goes past and I forget about rescheduling, and then a month goes past and I forget about the idea altogether.

A year goes past and I see his company in the news receiving over $2m in venture capital funding.

Also, sorry for this being long, see tl;dr below.

I matched with a girl on Tinder today. The profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. I usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. [I decided to just message her, ""I don't have much to go off from your profile. What does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt"" She responds, ""Wanna touch my butt in perosn""](https://imgur.com/a/x6cAs3V) You can read the rest of the conversation from that Imgur link. Bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that I would give her $40 for some weed.

This felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. So far in life, I have only had sex with four people, and I make a serious attempt to date them. I asked my friends what I should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. I was going to say no, until I thought to myself, *""Hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.""*

I end up giving her my number and she calls me. There were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. First, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. It felt like I was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. Second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. I asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. I told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since I live alone. She ends up hanging up. I am thinking, *""Alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.""* She calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. This was the final item to make me feel uneasy. In hindsight she was obviously lying. The amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.

She agreed to do this at my place. I insisted that we get coffee first so I can make sure I am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. She agreed to that and I am feeling more comfortable now. She just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.

I leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. Up to this point, I was feeling really nervous about going through with this. Then, while I am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. I am just thinking to myself, *""Tonight is going to be fun! I am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some Mario Kart with her, 'watch Netflix', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?""*

Little did I know, I am about to get majorly bamboozled. The address she gave me was not listed. I call her, she says just to meet her at the Rite Aid on the corner. This is when I should have known to back out. However, at this point, I am dead set on eating pussy. I meet her at the Rite Aid parking lot. She actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. She said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. She gets the call 2 minutes later. I am thinking to myself, *""What kind of drug dealer is this prompt?""* but me being a gullible idiot, I give her my $40 anyways.

Then she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. I immediately realize that I have been played. She texts me, ""Ur beat sorry"" and that was that.

Was I mad? No, not at all. The situation could have been far worse. It could have been more money. She could have been an undercover cop. She could have been lying about her age. I could have been beat up by her boyfriend. I could have gotten an STD. The list goes on folks.

Right now, I feel three things. I feel great shame, this is not the guy I am. I am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. I also feel really bad for her. She must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. I am sure that she needs my $40 more than I do. Finally, I feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. If this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.

Ladies and gentlemen, what did we learn today? If a situation seems too good to be true, it is.

tl;dr I met a girl on Tinder who just wanted to get high and fuck. I give her the money for the weed and she just walks off with it.

Edit: Just woke up, will try to respond some of you throughout the day. Thanks for all the comments and to whoever it was that gave gold! I know, I am an idiot. I don’t mind being the *butt* of a joke though because you people are absolutely hilarious!"

(First reddit post, that’s why story took so long to tell.) 

At the time I lived in Moscow, Russia with my family, im swedish but my father worked at the embassy in Moscow. I was always fucking/playing around as a young lad. While in Moscow we lived in a quite pompous neighberhood with mostly other diplomats as well as russian businessman who often are pretty shady (as yall know).

After school me and my best friend always used to hang out. I lived in an apartment in a big tower of a building. On every level there were two apartments and with that two doors. I lived on something like the 4-5 floor so I always took the elevator. Me and my friend one day ended up on the highest floor while being annoying and pressing all of the buttons in the elevator. That floor was being renovated, it was covered in plastic and overall looking kinda abandonned. The floor gave off a creepy feeling. As on all levels there were two doors. In Russia it is common that you have quite pompous doors with patterns and different materials. Rich people would flex not only with cars but also with doors. One of these two doors at the top of the building was hella pimped out. 

The door was gray with buttons and made out of a fluffy pillowlike soft material, how I know it was soft? Well we felt on it. Me and my friend not only felt on it, because of its’ texture and the fact that we thought the apartment to be abondonned (yep) we made it a tradition to everytime we took the elevator to my flat first visit THE DOOR to pet it.

This tradition continued for a couple of weeks and one day we were hanging out at my place after petting the door when my father called on me. When I came to him he was standing at the door that was occupied by two big russian men armed with handguns. They started talking in russian which already normally sounds like an angry language. They looked hella scary with guns and they were both looking at me dead in the eyes while basically screaming. I had no idea what was going on (I spoke very little russian) until my father asked if I had been at the top floor doing suspicious stuff. 

That was when I realized my fuck up. The russian body guards (my father told me they said that they introduced themselves as BGs) continued to lecture me for a while and my father looked quite amused. Then suddenly one of them started smiling and said something like ”good boy” in english before leaving. I stopped shitting my pants and asked my father what they said. He explained that they had seen me and my friend day after day walking up to THE DOOR and petting it in their surveillance system. I believe these body guards to work for some big time russian buisnessman perhaps even a criminal. I do not see why they would be armed otherwise. I can not with certainty say that they were gangsters but that would be my guess.

This incident was scary at the time but is a very fond memory from Russia today. I never petted THE DOOR again. Actually I have not petted a door since.

TL;DR
12 YO me petted neighbors door in Russia and got visit from armed gangster body guards.

So until 20 minutes ago I owned a gorgeous, bright yellow Death Grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. My mum bought it me for Christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.

Last night I went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive Spanish girl who was just in Manchester for the weekend. We chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold English weather. I predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. Fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. I realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. 

This is where I make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. I had the smart idea that if I let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she HAS to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. I essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* This is what happened. 

The next day I awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. By 5 in the evening I start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. My messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. 

To the Spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. 

Rest In Peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys this is pretty insane, also thanks for the gold and silver! To everyone offering to buy me a new one, thanks for being so kind and thoughtful but I'll have to politely decline. It would be too weird for me haha but if theres anyone in the UK that has one lying around that theyd maybe sell give me a message! x"

Usually I’m great at finding it whenever we’re going at it, but tonight was not my night, when things were getting hot and heavy, I slipped my fingers down there and did the usual. My girlfriend (26F) asked what I was rubbing and I replied, “Your clit….?” And in confusion she replied, “No, I’m not feeling anything.”  

For a second I was thrown off because how is she not feeling what I was rubbing for the past five minutes? So I poked what I thought was her clit and asked, “You mean this?” And by doing that, whatever the fucked I poked, caused her to yell in pain, “Yes, that!” 

It turned out that above her hood was  this cyst that was the same size as her clit and that’s what I was rubbing for the past 5 mins. Huge mood killer for the both of us, and now she’s upset that she has this weird pimple that she didn’t know of until now. I tried to comfort her but she’s not wanting to listen.

TL;DR Rubbed what I thought was my gf’s clit, turned out to be a big cyst above it. FML

EDIT: Turned out to be an ingrown hair, no I’m not posting it on r/popping you nasties.

EDIT 2: Since everyone is asking why she didn’t feel it for a while, it wasn’t that long of a time, like maybe a minute when she noticed it. Anyways, thanks for the advice, girlfriend is feeling better and it’s just a laughable memory."

He was cute, tall, and had a raspy voice and British accent (my weakness), and we spent a good amount of time that night just talking and chilling. We ended up exchanging numbers before my group left. We texted pretty consistently for a few days, and planned a date (archery and drinks). When I arrived at the range and saw Max in the light of day, I knew I had made a mistake. Upside: He was actually even cuter than I remembered. Downside: He was most definitely a she (the boobs were unmistakable in her top), albeit pretty androgynous. After a bit of convo, I confirmed that she definitely identified as a female and a lesbian. I explained that I was straight, and thought she was a guy, and she luckily laughed it off (apparently it’s happened before). We still ended up finishing up our date, and had a great time; we’ve hung out multiple times since then. I have since introduced her to a friend who’s actually a lesbian, and they really hit it off, and have been on a few dates. My friends have been roasting me for weeks, but I gained a friend and my friend gained a potential girlfriend, so really can’t complain.

TL;DR: I accidentally went on a date with an androgynous lesbian after meeting her in a poorly-lit club, thinking she was a guy.

When I go shopping or order things online I always give a phone number that is one digit different than mine because I don't want them to sell my info. By using the be same number every time I am consistent if I'm ""already in the system"".  I've been using this number for about 10 years everywhere from JCPenney to Best Buy to financial services, etc.

Yesterday I got a new client and he had the same number I've been using as my ""fake number"".  I tried my best not to show any emotion to hearing it but I asked him how long he's had that number.  He said ""Oh, about 15 years, but I may get a new one because I get non-stop telemarketing calls.""  I told him, ""I get some once in awhile too. Aren't they annoying *haha*""

He says, ""Yeah, I think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.""

I said, ""That happens to me from time to time as well, people think I'm {old homeowner's name} or {bosses name}. Oh well. Email me if you change your number.""

He says ""I will. Actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. What's your number? I bet they are getting us confused.  It seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we're not related"".

I gave him my work number.

**tl;dr: i've been giving out a fake number and met the guy who actually has that number in real life and he gets telemarketing calls non-stop because of it.**

Edit: So tonight I had a meeting at the guy's office to go over a proposal. I spent too much time reading comments this afternoon (and felt bad) and I told him my personal number was one digit off from his.  So he says, ""Yeah I figured everyone had misdialed for the last few years or this might have been your old number."" He knew right away when he saw my name...

So, I never told him I had given every company on Earth his number (not knowing it was him) but I did tell him i gave the wrong number at Guitar Center a few times. Dont ask me why I came clean for one place but not the rest of them. He laughed it off.

So, I've learned not to give any more fake numbers and I did bring the guy a gift card to Longhorn Steakhouse as 'thanks and take your wife out to dinner"" when in reality I felt bad because I didn't think through my actions and many of you called me out."

The inevitable happened. The sex worker my dad hired to terminate my virginity in the dead of night did not keep her mouth shut. I know. I should've seen it coming. When I shared my original post, I was convinced my dad didn't know I was gay. I never said anything to anyone about my sexuality other than to the sex worker who teamed up with my father to unexpectedly put me in a vulnerable position. My dad and I have been avoiding each other since that night. Not gonna lie, I was okay with that. We needed space. The words divorced dad, virgin son and sex worker should never be said in the same sentence. 

This morning my dad showed up at my apartment. Unusual but not surprising. He was courteous enough to call beforehand. Asked if I was available. Said he wanted to talk. I assumed he was still feeling bad about ambushing me with a sex worker and wanted to make sure that our relationship was intact. Little did I know that my dad's primary objective was to establish if his 20 year old son was sexually attracted to other people's 20 year old sons. As soon as my dad made himself at home in my living room, he asked if we were alone. I said my roommate was at the gym. My dad's response was to drop the following line: ""sharing an apartment with a guy who works out must be motivating."" Slow clap. Subtle as fuck, my father. He didn't even need to wink at the camera. 

My dad asked if my roommate had a gf. I implied that he had girls that come and go. My dad said my roommate must be handsome to get so much attention. I shrugged and said ""or he's paying for it."" It was a joke. An uncomfortable joke based on my dad's disturbed expression. My dad said he could explain the sex workers and answer all my questions if was prepared to listen. I said it was none of my business and he didn't owe me an explanation, but I did suggest that he at least considered therapy. My dad said he was proud of the person I've become and promised to think about my suggestion. As wholesome as that moment was, the gay elephant was still in the room, so I awkwardly asked my dad if he recently communicated with the sex worker he hired to sleep with me. 

My dad said no because he wanted to respect my privacy and avoid crossing the line again. Based on all the random references to my roommate's attractiveness, I was convinced my dad heard I was gay from one of the other sex workers, who heard it from the sex worker with the motormouth. We danced around the topic of my sexuality for a little longer because it was still a big moment despite all the weird shit that happened the last time my dad and I were under the same roof. I eventually came out and said it. ""Dad, I'm gay."" My dad stood up and showed me he was wearing socks with rainbow stripes to celebrate the news. I didn't even notice his socks until he lifed the leg opening of his pants. He said it was a gift from the sex workers. He had another pair of rainbow socks in his pocket, which he gave to me when we were done hugging. 

I suppose the outcome could've been worse. I doubt there will be another update, so thank you for riding this wave with me. 

TL:DR An update post, not really a fuck up. I informed a sex worker with a motormouth that I was gay and expected her to keep that information private. She spread the news amongst her fellow sex workers who eventually shared it with one of their loyal clients, which happened to be my dad."

Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

I went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

Fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

TL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.

It was a simple case, nothing special. With one of the surgeons who likes to converse with the guys. As I'm not one of the guys, I simply sit back and chart while half listening out for anything they may need me to get. Which I don't mind at all because I'm insanely quiet by nature. 

Often with cases that last longer than an hour, we insert catheters to make sure the patient is producing urine still, and that they hadn't nicked the urinary system. The collection bag is hung at the foot of the table for easy access, to assess the output.

So, I'm charting halfway into the case and all of the sudden out of the corner of my eye I see the surgeon turn toward me and he says ""You're a skier!?"" I was totally caught off guard cause he never converses with women, at least who aren't doctors. 

I momentarily stared at him, trying to figure out how he knew I was a skier and why he would ask me that.  I then proceeded to talk about how why yes I love to ski and I've been here and there. Used to snowboard but switched back to skiing. And so on. Then I pause and realize everyone in the room was just staring at me. 

The surgeon then with his super heavy South American accent then sternly repeats himself and says ""Urine's clear??"" 

I just about lost it. I said something like ""oh!"" Then ran to the bag to check and said yeah it's clear. 

I had to leave the room because I couldn't contain myself. I was crying. When I finally put on my straight face and reenterd, the surgeon goes ""So what else do you do?"" They had a good laugh. 

It was super embarrassing and hysterical and it actually made him acknowledge me from then on. 


TL;DR

During surgery, thought the surgeon asked me about my skiing hobby,  when he really asked if the urine was clear.


Edit: I'm happily surprised so many of you appreciated my less than perfectly written story time! And I love the stories you've shared as well.  Just to clarify, I was crying from laughter not sad crying. It's something I probably learned from my dad. I really think he should post his stories on here. Also, the surgeon is from a South American country...his accent is so thick that if I'm walking by, I have to try really hard to figure out if he's speaking Spanish or English. That plus masks on top...things can get funny. Especially since he's such a serious character normally. Also thank you so much for the awards ❤

Also, started my first day yesterday orienting in a new unit. I'm sure I'll have more embarrassment to share!"

I just moved to the suburbs of New Jersey from Philadelphia a few months ago. I was at a friends house for a zoom baby shower and I ended up staying all day and playing video games and eating dinner. My boyfriend met me there later on to hang out and parked next to me in the driveway. They live on the entrance to a cul-de-sac.

We were getting ready to leave around 12:30 AM and my phone had died so I figured I would back out behind him and follow him home since I am new to the area. I pulled out extra wide to give him space and I did not see a dark blue car parked behind their driveway (it was pretty hazy/foggy that night) and I scratched the side of the car with my tail light. Minimal body damage was done to the door, a few scratches, a little bit of paint from my car. I got out of my car, immediately wrote a note with my information on it, and decided to go home so I could charge my phone and call my insurance.

I got home and immediately called my insurance and they requested I upload a copy of the police report. Ok, ill call the police, let them know what happened, shouldn't be a big deal, this happens all the time right? wrong. The cop told me he was going to charge me with a hit and run. He accused me of being drunk (I was not at all). I offered to meet him at the station, at the scene of the accident, at my house. He refused to meet me anywhere he told me it was ""too late I had already made the wrong choice and he was forced to charge me"" I started to drive back to the ""scene of the accident"" and he told me on the phone to pull over and immediately send him all of my information in an email. I complied with everything he told me to do. He told me he was going to the residence of the people who's car I hit to notify them and that they were ""probably going to want to press charges against me"".

I told him to call me back after he got done there. He never did. The next day I was able to get in touch with the neighbor who was awesome. She was super understanding and if anything was just mad the cop showed up at her house at 1 AM. She told me he said ""we are forced to charge her since she left the scene"" and the neighbor replied ""she left a note, anyone would have done that, its 1 AM, this is not necessary"" and at that point he urged them to press charges on me because I ""could have been drunk and am old enough to know better"".

A week goes by and I hear nothing from the officer. The car is in the shop getting fixed and my insurance is paying for it. The neighbors have no intent of pressing any charges against me. I send the neighbors a basket filled with milkbar cookies for causing them any trouble. Yesterday I get a ticket in the mail for ""leaving the scene of an accident"" with a mandatory court appearance and I just hired a very expensive lawyer. I work in sales and have a company car I have to drive for work. My lawyer wanted to know how the police even got involved, to which I replied ""I called them"". I called the cops on myself. Now I have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed. I could lose my job over a bad driving record. so yeah, TIFU.


TL;DR - accidentally scratched a car, thought i did the right thing, might lose my license for 6 months

If your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.

My son’s birthday was yesterday, so I’ve been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don’t break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

Around 7 o’clock everyone left except my husband’s best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I’ve had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
Around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I’ve got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

This is where my FU begins.

I was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let’s face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it’s dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

I went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt “find” it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. 
I was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn’t the kind of sexytime I had in mind. 

I decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out “homedoctor” for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

Trying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
I wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn’t ready to hear “yo pussy so big, tampons get lost” jokes for the rest of my life). 

So before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. 

Nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

So here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

Decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I’m in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! 

I felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! 

Before I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

I look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would’t have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..
...Then the realisation kicked in.. 

I.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

If you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it’s around 2/3 o’clock now.

In my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn’t nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. “Well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother.” Okay... 

IWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  “......”  Daddy?  “......” “M. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!” 

So now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. 
So I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im oké.. 

“Ma’am, are you shivvering?” Yes I am. “Can you decribe how bad?” Well I was in the shower, and now I’m standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I’m getting kinda cold. 
“Okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma’am?” Yes I am dizzy. “Can you decribe how dizzy?” Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) “Well I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?” Yes I am. “Okay sweety how bad is it?” Well I’m heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. “Oh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than.” 

She suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn’t so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that “would have happend more gently” (no shit Sherlock).

There is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.

So for not letting go drunken sexytime, I’m now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn’t want to hear “Yo pussy so big” jokes, now I’m gonna hear “Remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD” jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..

TL;DR

Today I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks.

Edit: Wow this really blew up after I went to sleep! Glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! And its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! 

Some aditional info as requested:

- A IUD is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big T shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the T is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. 

- No thank God it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that I gave birth to to kids)

- Yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!

- Yes I’m fullt aware now that I didnt have to tell my parents I wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.

- I’m 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes I called for my mommy

- I could have asked husband to remove The Lost Tampon, but I figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal I didnt ask him. (Thank God, cause this would have scarred him for life!)

- As for The Lost Tampon.. I have no idea, I must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of Erebor

Thanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold AND platinum! This made my FU a little less embarrasing!"

My BF was away for a week to see his family (in our COVID19 safety bubble) for the holidays. We were laying in bed catching up and one thing led to another and I started going down on him. 

We were just starting out so he still had a shirt on. His shirt was Vault Boy from the video game FallOut giving a big thumbs up. Now, I have never played FallOut before but I know about it since it’s pretty popular. Unfortunately, I know enough about it that as I am giving him that sexy eye contact during the bj, I kind of notice the Vault Boy and the thumbs up. 

I guess i wanted to fit in with the Vault Boy cause my horny brain decided to give my BF a huge thumbs up while I’m deep throating his pole. When he looked at me all confused I decided to very confidently say: 

**I am the Vault Boy. I live underground**

Bless him he tried to keep a straight face cause I literally said that and started blowing him again. When I realized what I just said I laughed until I cried. I was still eatin dick tho and laughing crying and choking all at once. 

Needless to say we had to take a sexy time break and now he won’t stop telling me I’m his vault boy. 


TL;DR; got cock blocked by the vault boy from FallOut"

This actually happened today, about 30 minutes ago. 

So I went on a tinder date with this girl last night, it was great, she's really pretty and we had a great time. We came back to her place as it was close by and ended up doing the deed multiple times and ended up in bed. Now I haven't had much action in a while and it really tired me out, so I slept like a rock.

Fast forward to about half an hour ago and I wake up butt naked, alone in her bed, but I can hear her downstairs in the kitchen. So I'm tossing and turning for a bit when all of a sudden this gorgeous grey floofy kitty comes and hops on the bed and starts purring like mad, I happily oblige and pet the shit out of it. I love cats. I didn't have the covers on me as it was hot and this cat felt so soft, flopping itself against my skin. 

So the cat starts getting playful, hopping over my body from one side to the next, and I'm rolling side to side tickling its belly inbetween, but when I roll ove next, my schlong flips over with me, sailing through the air in a perfect arch, just before it slapped my belly the cat pounced straight onto it and dug two paws in, one on the shaft and one on the head (much like last night). I fucking screamed in agony, sat up and started trying to pull its claws out my sausage. The one on my head came off straight away but there was a claw still hanging on for dear life about halfway down which was fully lodged. The cat started to panic because it was stuck. I heard my date running upstairs and as she came in I was sat up with her cat buried in my crotch holding onto its leg trying to free it. I whimpered 'cock stuck, help' and she burst out laughing but reached over and unhooked the last claw out my shaft, leaving me naked and embarrassed. 

I waddled over to the bathroom with blood trickling down onto my ballsack and sat on the toilet dabbing the little holes with tissue. I'm still sat here now, with tissue pressed against my member as it write this. Going to have a shower I think.

tl;dr Played with my tinder dates cat the morning after and they thought my cock was a toy, claws got stuck in multiple places now I have a sore penis.

Edit: OK I've been reading a lot of comments and apparantly I should see a doctor?? How the fuck do I explain this scenario??"

Technically this happened about three weeks ago since the test just came back positive...

Some background: 

Last year my wife and I had our first child. It was a less than ideal pregnancy that had her dealing with weeks of bed rest dude to preeclampsia with severe features. It wrecked total havoc on not only her physical health but her mental heath as well. fortunately everything was all right in the end and she gave birth to our healthy 4lb 2oz boy just shy of two months early (who’s doing fantastic now). 

Due to the difficulty of this first pregnancy and concerns over COVID, we decided it was best to put off kid number two for at least a couple of years. She started birth control shortly after giving birth to be sure we had no surprises, but the pill tends to make her very sick and she wanted to lose weight, so she stopped taking it. We thought rubbers would be enough, but that’s where our cat comes in... 

Our cat is an evil genius. I seriously think the greasy orange little shit is still smarter than our nearly one year old. He gets into everything, and I do mean everything. No door, drawer, or cabinet can stop him, and if he knows where something he wants is he WILL find it. It’s so bad that for weeks after adopting him I thought there was poltergeist in the house because each morning I’d wake up to find every single cabinet door in the kitchen wide open!

So how did I fuck up and let him impregnate my wife? 

Well, my first fuck up was storing the condoms in the same drawer as the Q-tips, which he loves to get into and shred apart. He must have seen the box of Q-tips in the drawer when I put my rubbers away, because not even an hour later I stumbled upon a horrific scene of chewed plastic straws, shredded cotton fluff and shiny gold condom wrappers scattered around the gapping drawer that once contained them... I didn’t think anything of it at the time and just cleaned up the destroyed Q-tips and put the condoms that had spilled everywhere back into their box without a concern in the world. 

We ended up having some sexy time later that night, and I vividly remember stumbling into the dark bathroom, opening said drawer, and blindly fumbling around in the box to pull out a condom (as was the routine) thinking nothing of what happened earlier. 

That is until fast forward a few weeks to just the other day, when my wife was complaining of nausea and tender breast. We immediately shoot each a concerned glance as this ain’t our first rodeo, and she felt the same way before discovering her first pregnancy. She still had a half empty box of tests from the year before and decided to take one just to be sure. Followed by another one... and another one... all positive. 

We start wracking our brains wondering what happened when suddenly it hits me... that damned cat. I ran over to bathroom drawer where I kept the condoms, dumped out the box on the counter and started to inspect each miserable little foil square. Sure enough, several had noticeable scratches, teeth marks, and even full blown punctures in them... which leads me to fuck up number two, not checking to see if the cat chewed on any of my rubbers weeks before when he had gotten into that drawer...

Can't wait to explain to my new son or daughter one day that they owe their existence
to the family cat!

TL:DR

I didn’t check to see if my cat had chewed on any of my condoms when he got into the drawer I kept them in. Three weeks later and despite our plans to the contrary my wife is pregnant, presumably thanks to my asshole cat who gets into everything.

EDIT:

I’ve been informed of something called the cat tax. Below you’ll find a picture of the offending cat in all his greasy, orange glory. I think the picture sums up his personality well.

Also, obligatory not today but two years ago.

Let's flashback to two years ago, I picked up my VERY drunk (now ex) boyfriend from the pub. We were pretty early on in the relo so I thought this would be a great opportunity to get the boyf to open up and spill his secrets.

I asked him, 'Hey, tell me a secret.' and what he said next will forever haunt me to my core. He turned to me, looked me dead in the eye, and said 'I like to stick things up my ass. I like to stick *carrots* up my ass.'

Now don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of carrots as a vegetable. Before 'the incident' I would eat them everyday as a quick snack, and use them for all my cooking. I would say I would rate them as God Tier.

And I'm definitely not one to kink shame, if anything - I froth a good kink, but something about the carrots made me sad. Possibly, the fact that I put carrots high up on the vegetable hierarchy and this seemed like blasphemy. The carrot gods are crying. I also suggested getting a legitimate sex toy for him, but each time I asked I was shut down with scoff.

Despite the carrot-shame it brought me, I decided to support him on his carrot endeavor.

He was beyond happy with the carrot-support, and told me he's waited years to finally tell someone. So flash forward through the next 12 months of my life which consisted of only getting him off by sticking a carrot up his crack, him spending copious amounts from our joint account on bags of carrots, and me coming home from a long days at work to see two soggy carrots in the shower with a sad bottle of lube.

It's been a year since carrot-gate, and I still can't look at one without shedding a tear. Ultimately, I think it was the carrots that ended the relationship. I was never orange enough.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I asked my boyfriend to tell my a secret and he confessed he loves sticking carrots up his clacker. That year of my life is now only referred to as 'carrot-gate.'

&#x200B;

EDIT: spelling & holy moly thank you for the awards and the comments - I got a good giggle out of them.  And trust me, I know the joint account was ridiculous - we were young and thought getting a joint account would mean we would be together forever LOL. Little did I know..."
mj7ren,LPT don't go for a 20 mile walk without prior experience....,26937,0.76,3188,2021-04-03 18:12:28,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mj7ren/lpt_dont_go_for_a_20_mile_walk_without_prior/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/mj7ren/lpt_dont_go_for_a_20_mile_walk_without_prior/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"So here it goes.

Me, F 19 UK. Started growing wisdom teeth and since I couldn't handle the pain anymore I asked the nhs to give me an appointment with a dentist since all in my area are booked.

And the appointment I got was 20 miles away from where I lived. In a different town.

So, genius me comes up with the idea to walk the 20 miles since Google said its only 6 hours and 20 minutes. First bad idea. Should've just taken the train.

So the day of the appointment (a couple of weeks ago), I wake up at 1am and prepare some food and drink for the walk. I head out at 2am and my appointment is at 10:10.

I told myself that 8 hours is more than enough (since I'm reletively fit. So it's pitch black and I head outside without my glasses. Second bad idea since I can't see anything without them, but I'm too lazy to go up and get em.

As I start its reletively OK, I'm walking through my town. It's quiet and dark. As I head outside the city area, it's just fields upon fields of crops. Beautiful night lights of the city and I took some pictures. Now as I walk further out, . On the third mistake, google in all its wisdom, tells me to walk alongside the highway....

So I'm walking  5/6 miles in 4/5am and the road is empty and I'm listening to contrapoints videos that I downloaded earlier. Good Times. 

And as I approach my 10th mile 6am, I can feel the pain in my foot getting worse and walking on the grass on the side of the road is very much harder than walking on the road. And since cars started using the road I had to move to the grass. OOF!

So now I have a very sore foot and all the water I drank earlier is starting to signal its release.....try and hold it in but I  fixed the problem later in my own way that I'm not gonna say on reddit. 

Now on the 13th mile around 7am ish. Pain is spreading to the hips and I need some more snacks. And thankfully there's a beautiful village ahead and a corner shop/grocery shop that I spot from afar. I take some pics of the village and I go into the shop and I buy chocolates (good) and soda (4th mistake). So on my next break (I had been taking regular 5min breaks) I decided to have some soda, on an empty stomach ........oh, the pain in my tummy!!!! Despite that, I get up and walk since in this remote part of the country,  I can't just call an uber and give up....I can only do that in the final town.

Around 15/16th mile and 8am ish, shit gets real! My whole body is aching and I'm starting to approach the outskirts of the other town and finally there are some proper side walks to walk on. But guess what, google fucks me again (5th fuck up) and this town has some of the longest and steepest hills ever. Like 2 miles long and all incline. My foot is giving up and I'm just pushing myself to get in town so I can call an uber. 


So, it's  the last two miles and its already 9:30 am. So I know I'm not gonna get my appointment. Sidenote: my phone is at 15%, down all the way from 100 at start.  I'm just inching ahead at this point, and this is the 2mile incline hill. Life just fucks me harder and I need to pee again! (I blame the soda!)
So now I'm getting into the main town and walking like a zombie....

So now I make a smart move and decide to go to the big morrisons (similar to walmart) at the end of this long and shitty Road. I only have to go straight, so no need for shitty google and I turn my phone off as well. (Another smart move)


Now (around 10am) as I inch closer to my prize, (the toilet) I can stand anymore cause of the pain. But thank god I find some benches along the road to rest and massage my legs. 

Finally around 11am after 20 miles of walking, I see the morrisons logo!

 YES!

 The final few steps through the parking lot were the hardest! And I storm in and find the closest bathroom nearby. Sweet relief!

After that, I finally noticed that I'm getting very hungry! So I buy all the cake I want. (And a spoon). I start to devour the cake as I realise, One: this cake tastes amaizing! And 2: I didn't call an uber yet! (Very close major fuck up)

So I open my phone and 5%left......I quickly enter my home address into the app and get confirmation that the driver arrives in 8 min. But phone turns off as I almost read the name of the car and driver. I only managed to see the grey colour of the car....and now begins the most stressful 8 mins of my life as I wait in front of morrisons for a grey car with an uber logo......my phone is dead and if I miss this uber I'm very fucked! In a new town, can't walk at all and with no access to my phone for help, I'm done for!


Finally the car arrives! (it stopped in front of me) and I get in and relax. And on the way back, we travel the same route that I took and I get a second reminder of every single one of my fuckups. But hey, I atleast can brag that I once walked 20 miles at once!

When I got home, I took off everything and showered first. And enjoyed the rest of the cake ( this is a cake for 16 people!) and went to sleep. I couldn't walk properly for a few days and I had a mild fever. And the pain in the joints and muscles lasted for about a week. And the tooth pain went away anyways.....


Thanks for reading this despite my horrible storytelling.




TLDR: I overestimated my walking capability, got cocky (pun intended) and tried to walk 20 miles in 6 hours.....got fucked by google maps directions.... ended up spending ~9 hours and almost got stuck in a different town with no phone and no ability to move.

Walking 20 miles at once is a 0/10, wouldn't recommend.



Edit: this is what rip inbox feels like....I'm sorry but I don't think I can answer everyone's comments...

Edit 2: for the people asking why I didn't take my glasses, I should've clarified that I can still function fine without them. But its just nice to have them. And also I didn't want to wake up my roommate by constantly going in and out.

Edit 3: American English helps everyone understand what I'm talking about. And also I lived in America for a while so some of the words are still stuck in my head. And for anyone with  doubt of my britishness u can go sod off."

Didn't happen today, on mobile, throwaway account etc.

My job requires me to travel a lot between the USA and Canada - I have a 50/50 client split between the two places, so although I am based in Los Angeles, I fly into Toronto every few weeks.

All of my family and friends are also in LA, and I'm from a very conservative background, so when I realized at about age 12 that the thought of both girls and boys made me want to fiddle with my diddle, I kept the latter quiet to avoid being disowned by my father or giving my mom a heart attack. I've had plenty of girlfriends before and they're happy, I'm happy and there's no need to change that. Anyway.

I headed out to Toronto last Friday morning for a few meetings. Every now and then, I'll have meetings Friday and Monday, so I'll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.

At about 4pm on Friday, I had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. Anyone in the bi community will know it's easier to pickup guys then girls, so I downloaded Grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because I'm ugly and half because I don't want to be recognized) and did some browsing. Some 20ish minutes in - I got a message. This guy was about my age, didn't have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my Friday night.

We start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he's married and asks if I'd be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. Now a threesome wasn't on my to-do list, but I'll give anything a go once so I said what the hell.

Anyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and I get a call. I have two SIM cards in my phone (one from Canada and one from the USA). It's my cousin who lives in Canada. I only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it's a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and I was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so I let it go to VM. 60 seconds later, a txt. From my cousin:

&#x200B;

*""Hi it's xxxxx from Grindr. We're 2 minutes away, OK if we're a bit early?""*

&#x200B;

It took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. Canada. Gay Married Cousin. The Description Matches. Holy fucking shit, I just organised a threesome with my cousin.

I sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. Now obviously I'm not going to answer it, and I'm just praising god that I gave him my Canadian number over Grindr that he didn't have, and that I had him saved in my phone. The room phone begins to ring as well. Holy shit.

I swear to god, I have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. At the bottom of the staircase, I was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest McDonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and I took the SIM card out of my phone and snapped it in half. Found a new hotel room that night just in case. Have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why I need a new Canadian number, but I think it was better than the other option...

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Went to Canada for work, wanted a quick hookup, didn't do my due diligence and almost ended up having a threesome with my gay cousin and his husband, ran away and hid in a McDonalds for 4 hours**"

My parents didn't raise me spiritual or anything but I knew they did have a little shrine they liked to keep some things and whatever it was just part of the house I had friends ask me about and it was nothing crazy. They are also really fond of leathers and animal skins which... Cringe but anyway. When I got old enough I asked my parents what tribe we were and I was told the Yuan-Ti. Now I didnt know anything of it but I did tell my friends in elementary school and whatever and bragged I was close to nature (as you do). So recently I applied to colleges and since you only have to be 1/16 native I thought I had this in the bag. Confirmed with my parents and sent in my applications as 1/8th Yuan-ti tribe.  I found out all these years that is a fictional race of snake people from Dungeons and Dragons. TLDR: since I was a kid my parents told me I was native Yuan-ti but actually they were just nerds and I told everyone I know that I was a fictional snake person."

Horribly. 

Horribly. 

Wrong. 

After almost a year of separation, my divorce was finalized this week. And what a better way to celebrate, than with a good old fashioned booty call. 

I had recently reconnected with a man I had previously had some playtime with. The last time we were together, I had what was probably the best sex of my life. So to say I was excited to be talking with him again was an understatement. 

After some basic chat, we made plans to meet up tonight. This next tidbit may seem like TMI, but it’s important to the story. My IUD does not play nice and more often than not I’m bleeding to some extent. Tonight included. But he was fine with that, so we kept our plans. 

He comes over, and things instantly get heated. More MIND BLOWING sex commences. Hot, steamy, sheet soaking sex. We take some time to recharge and go for round 2. Not as hot and steamy, but still damn good. I lay down next to him, but under the covers. He gets up and starts getting dressed. We have some small talk, and then he walks over to my side of the bed and looks at the floor. 

“What is THAT?” He says. 

“What?” I look over the edge of the bed. There are two dark spots on the floor. “Eh. I’ll clean it up”

“You know what this is, right?” He asks. 

“I’m pretty sure it’s...”

“It’s not blood” he interrupts. “That’s not red.”

“What??”

Again, he says “That’s not blood. That’s BROWN. You know what that is.”

“No.” I stammer. “That can’t be. I would have known if that happened.” 


He just starts laughing, DOUBLE CHECKS HIS SOCKS, and heads down my stairs, and out the door. 

Y’all. I came so hard, I pooped. Somehow, during  round 1, my body was contracting so intensely, I actually dropped two small turds. And since my ass was off the edge of the bed, they landed on my bedroom floor without either of us noticing. In my defense, I had just finished a round of augmentin a few days prior, and my stomach is still readjusting. 

Pretty sure he’s already deleted my contact info. He’s given me the best sex of my life, and it’s most likely never happening again.

TL;DR: I pooped during some of the best sex of my life. He took off as soon as we realized what happened. Bye amazing sex."

My husband, my cat and I are chilling and suddenly my husband farts. Large. Seemingly as a reaction, with perfect timing and a traumatized facial response, my cat gets up and ditches. I start cracking up and immediately text my sister “hahahahaha [husbandname] farted and [catname] left!!!”

Buuuuut it turns out I accidentally texted my husband instead of my sister about himself farting. He opens the text and shows it to me. I am utterly confused for a moment about how he has this text. Then it registers that I texted him making fun of him and I start cracking up even harder. My pregnant self not slightly, but COMPLETELY loses bladder control. 

Now, every time I make fun of my husband, he says “are you gonna text me about it?” Or, alternatively, “are you gonna pee about it?”

TL;DR I meant to text my sister making fun of my husband but mistakenly texted my husband making fun of my husband. I followed up by providing further fodder for his comebacks.

I (22) watched some Netflix in the living room while my brother (24) played games in his room and my older brother (27) had work. The evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. 

My mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. An hour later she called to let me know she'll be home soon and my brothers and I have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. 

I went to my brothers, ""Hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. She'll be home in 5 minutes."" I walked away like I was so clever, not including myself as an option. 

""Why doesn't she help?"" I hear one say to the other. ""I dunno,"" the other says. 

A few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. 
""You grab the arms, I'll grab the legs?"" 
""Yup.""

My older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. I made it a little difficult though, I stiffened (which is probably easier) and I crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. 

Being the weak noodle I am, I couldn't hold my arms in long enough. He grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. I half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but I knew they would go all the way even when I had no jacket or shoes.

I didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, I struggled. I kicked my legs with little effort because I didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work I had an idea. Risky. I lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. 

I dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (I was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as I hit the floor I realized my shirt had lifted. My sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.

It was over. My ankles were released. 

I put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. Yup. The brother by my feet definitely saw. I noticed he was looking away at the moment, but I was sure he saw when it happened. 

Thankfully I am small chested, so I'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. 
But it is still awkward to think about.

P.S. Sorry bro....

TLDR: decided not to wear a bra today. my brother saw my nipple. 


Edit: I was home for the holidays from college, moving into a new place with my fiance this May. My brothers help support our single mom. Stop assuming people are fuckups 👍🏻

You're in for a ride.

I posted this in a comment thread of r/ask and people on there requested I put it on ""somewhere this story will get the recognition it deserves"" and I was directed to here.


Ok a little back story I got a rescue puppy back in January and she was terrified of everything and everyone. There was a pet store down the street I used to carry her to to try and expose her to the outside world and other people. 

The girl who worked at the pet store instantly bonded with my puppy, wow. My dog wouldn't let anyone else go near her without her crying or peeing or being terrified. So naturally we became regulars, and the more and more I interacted with this girl and the more I saw her interactions with my dog an other people in the store she seems super sweet and just an all around good person. I asked her for her number, even though I felt uncomfortable doing that to a woman in her place of work but she seemed receptive, so that's good. It's also surprisingly hard to meet some one in my city. 

We exchange a few messages and go out for a walk with my dog together. Everything seems great. She's educated. Cute. Loves animals. Everything seems great. 

We end up back at my place for a few drinks (4or 5 max) this is kind of an important detail, and we stopped drinking around 10pm. And she ends up staying over. Now here's where it all goes downhill.

I awoke up in the middle of the night and she was yelling at herself about how her dad is an asshole, and some other crazy talk, very scattered subjects, hence why I can't be more specific but that one stuck out to me. Very strange behaviour for 2 am. 

I tried to calm her down or try and figure out what the fuck was going on. She didn't even seem to notice she was doing it, ""oh I'm sorry did I wake you?"" We had a really nice evening, But this girl just turned crazy. There was clearly something wrong  she wasn't shouting at me. She wasn't even shouting at her self just in to nothing, in to a void. 

I repeatedly tried to stop her, but she couldn't see the issue  as if she wasn't even aware she was doing it. Eventually I just gave up and went to sleep on the sofa because I just couldn't deal with it.

She came in and cried.and said she didn't mean to upset me and can we just go back to sleep together. 

Sure. That's all I wanted anyway. Can we please just sleep and can you please just stop shouting/ yelling / talking?

When we got to the bedroom she turned around and she had the craziest eyes I've ever seen (and I've dated red heads). And says ""don't you ever fucking talk to me like that ever again or I swear to god...."" Now at this point I've seen behavior like this before and it's very concerning.

-Nope. Get out. I cut her short on whatever threats she was going to make. Get the fuck out. 

Cue crying again ""but I'm a girl you can't do this to me""

Yeah I don't care I'm not doing. This it's two am and I'm not having you talk to me like this.

At this point there was a lot of back and forth from crying of ""but how am I meant to get home"" jumping to ""well fuck you I'm leaving"".
So she gathers her things and claims to not know how to get out the building. It's a condo building. You walk down the hall to an elevator. If there isn't an elevator. You went the wrong way so go the other way down the hall. Bearing in mind she lives in a condo building 3 blocks away. It's not like she doesn't know how a condo works or what area she in in.

So I offer to walk her to the door, or at least the elevator, I want her out. But I'm not just going to throw her literally out the door with out her things. I just want her out, there's clearly something not right and I don't want to deal with whatever it is or whatever will come of more of this behaviour. So I help her gather her things and open the door for her and start showing her where the elevator is.

Walking down the hall she collapsed! Like dead weight. And no she wasn't faking it. She was out cold, out of the blue. Just folded up right there in the hall.


Now here's where I fucked up. 


My thought process was 'hell nah, you're still leaving'.  So I drag her unconscious body down the hall and bundle her in the elevator. (Yup. Very aware this was a mistake in hindsight) 

Bearing in mind I was not expecting to be leaving, so you can imagine the look on the concierge's face when I rock up out of the elevator in my boxers shorts saying 'aw man i fucked up you gotta help me here'.

He's dialling 911 and sure enough, the elevator disappeared, up to the 4th floor. 
We called it back but obviously someone had tried to use the elevator and the door would have opened up to that train wreck. I'm sure the look on their face would have been priceless, anyway it came back and she was still unconscious.
We're talking to the 911 operator answering the base questions, address. What happened etc, and just like a horror movie we turn around and she's awake! Stood there. Crazy eyes and all.

She was awake long enough to yell at the concierge before she passed out again. This time hitting her head on the marble floor of the lobby. 

I'll never forget the sound of her head hitting the floor. Or the concierge's ""ooooo"" wince at the sound of it. 

So here's how the 911 call went. He's on speaker phone with me and the concierge there.

911: ok. So I need you to say 'now' every time she takes a breath. And I don't want you to stop until I say so, do you understand?
Me: yep. Got it
911: ok start now 
......
911: ok I don't think you understand my instructions,
Me: no dude. I understood. 
911: ok so start now and don't stop until I say so. Go.
Me: ok 
........ 
911 again ...
Me : dude. I understand. If she takes a breath I'll say now. 

So now of course she's not breathing.

911: ok you need to start cpr and the concierge needs to go get a defibrillator.

So here I am in my boxers doing CPR in the lobby of my building.

A fire truck pulls up after only 2 minutes they have a defibrillator concierge still hasn't come back yet. So they take over and an ambulance follows shortly where they bundle her in to the back and drive off.

Holy shit what just happened.

And of course now the cops turn up... 

Did I mention there's cameras in the elevator and just the part of the hallway that shows me dragging an unconscious girl, whom is now not breathing..... Yeahh try explaining that one.

So the cops want to know. Why are you kicking a girl out at 2 am. And why is she not breathing. And what's this on video ....

I told them everything but of course they didn't believe me, so now I'm terrified. What if she's dead. Nothing about this looks good for me. What if she's alive but, clearly she has psychological issues and decides to remember things a different way. Or in her mind I attacked her. Or if the cops turn up and say what did he do? And then that triggers her to say I did something. 

Fast forward 3 days and every time the phone rings I'm expecting it to be the cops, I have no idea if this girl is alive or dead. Or if she woke up in hospital and the cops questioning her, what did he do to you? Etc etc. Every day I have this hanging over me. I don't know what to do. I did text to see if she was alive. No reply.

I'm headed to the LCBO for a bottle of wine. And bang. She's right there infront of me! 

""Hi ! How's it going so great to see you!""
Erm. Hi. I thought you were dead!!
""Oh I was. But just for a few minutes haha""

Yeah. I know. I was the one doing CPR!

""Oh. I'm sorry. That explains why my chest hurts I guess. Haha. Oh well. So you wanna hang out? We could go back to your place for some drinks again.""

she has No recollection! Wants to come hang out.... No absolutely not. She had no idea about any of it. 

Needless to say I said no. Glad you're alive. Good luck. Goodbye. 
She left me a 2 minute long voice mail a few days later crying and trying to apologize, I don't need that in my dogs life Im afraid. 

I have many questions. As do many of my friends as well as people on a comment thread I put this on before. And unfortunately I don't think I will have any of the answers. And I'm not going to contact this person again to try and find answers. I'm aware dragging her down the hall and throwing her in the elevator wasn't the kosher thing to do.

Tldr: had a girl over for a date. She went crazy I had to do cpr and explain to the cops why there's video of me dragging her unconscious body down the hall and dumping it in the elevator.









Edit:. Not responding to any more comments. : Just spent an hour on the phone with said girl in the story.

I will update in a few days with not only her permission but her input."

My dude is a night owl I am not. I have a strict sleep schedule and sleep with a weighted blanket. Knowing my dude was going to play some Eve, I asked for some smooches and a tuck in. (No I did not replace the f with a t). We do the tuck in thing most nights as he likes to stay up past 11, I try not to so that I can function. 
My dude was a little extra zelous swinging one blanket and then another. He was the matador of blankets. Perfect arched blankets to fall so sweetly on my tired body. Until. Until the weighted blanket. 12 pounds of sleepy goodness swang into my face. Crunch beanbaggy smack. I have a slight redmark and a gut ache from laughing but no worse for the wear.

So I'm a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. The day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new LAV microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). Unfortunately, I didn't know this. See, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. The new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. I think you can kind of see where this is going. 

So anyways, there was one part where I had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. So after I get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. Once I was offstage, I began changing directly in front of the door I had just exited. This was because I had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before I returned. So this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of Thor Almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to THE ENTIRE CAST AND A GOOD 40% OF THE AUDIENCE. I freaked the fuck out and turned into [Patrick fucking Star](https://youtu.be/Kaqa2N_O-KE) as I ran to shut the door. Here's the FU. 

So here I am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, I reached out to grab the doorknob. I made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and I instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned American ""MOTHERFUCKER!"". I swear to fucking god the door stretched as I was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing I know, I was on stage, PANTS STILL DOWN, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. Turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where I was standing. So yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. On top of that, I didn't just say it, I screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. Here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:

""Say, do you like canned salmon?""
""I'm quite fond of it, yes.""
*door opens*
""Oh, there he is! This is my husb-""
*skinny Asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*
""MOTHERFUCKER^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!""
*door slams*
""....Well....how do you do Madame?""

Safe to say I'll never be in another production at my school again. 

TL;DR- I unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. 

In words of the old Western prospectors: GOLD! YEEE-HAWWW!!! Thanks, Stranger!

EDIT- ok I don't know how mics work, sorry!

My boyfriend (who asked to be called Magnum here 🙄 🙄so I'll refer to him as M) and I ended up making stuffed crust pizza. With grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. So does M, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.

&#x200B;

After blowing him, I pulled off to swallow, but I couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!

&#x200B;

Super embarrassed, I ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. It was still stuck in the back of my throat, but I couldn't swallow or spit, so I tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.

&#x200B;

We try everything—forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to Jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. Trying to make a little more tolerable, I took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting I can't swallow. So there I was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. To make matters worse, M eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously I can't have any.

&#x200B;

At \~4am, we give up the home remedies and Uber to the ER. I attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. She's probably like, ""why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?"" I write down that I'm nauseous and worried I'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. We end up with an audience of about \~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.

&#x200B;

One asks, ""How did this happen?""

Me: ...

Another doctor: ""Did you yawn?""

Me: ...uh...yeah...

🤦‍♀️

&#x200B;

One doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. It hurts like a bitch—this guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and I can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.

&#x200B;

But then!! Suddenly everything feels right again. It's all in place!!!

&#x200B;

We go home and the pizza is STILL good the next morning, and everything is okay. Well, besides having to send an ER bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( M looked awfully smug the whole time, but I appreciated him coming w me to the ER and letting me drool all over him

&#x200B;

TLDR: Dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. I had to go to the ER at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when I couldn't, and publicly humiliate myself

Replies here seem to support that it was most likely 6 based on the young-earth theory.

Obligatory this happened as a kid.

Some quick back story -- I was raised in an affluent/educated urban area, but all of my Mom's extended family are super country and live on farms. Most of my cousins are home schooled, but I always assumed this was just because the school systems suck there (they do suck). I enjoyed going to see my Grandparents cause I got to play with my cousins (only child) and spend time outside on the farm. We would mostly just drive down there for holidays or during the summer.

On one of my visits to Grandma's, our uncle took me and my little cousin to a big gun show/flea market type thing.

We were looking through this vendor who had a bunch of fossils, shark teeth, stuff like that. I thought it was really cool and pointed out a fossilized shark tooth. Underneath it, the description said something like 'this fossil is over 4 million years old'.

I showed my little cousin (she was 10). She got this really cheeky grin like she had some big secret, looked at me, and very matter of factly said 'This isn't real, the Earth is only 2,000 years old'.

I thought she was joking, so I laughed a bit and asked what she meant. She explained that she was 100% confident the Earth was only 2,000 years old, because she learned it in school and it was even in her textbook; therefore it must be true.

I started explaining...well, science... to her, and she kept insisting it was in her textbook; that evolution was false. She grabbed our Uncle and explained the situation and wanted him to tell me how wrong I was. He got this really worried look, told us it was time to go and he would explain once we got back to the truck.

The entire ride home he was tiptoeing around the subject, explaining we are taught different things in school; and finally settled on 'Well, God's time is different than our time, so when the Bible says 2,000 years; that's in God's time. For us, that's a lot longer, maybe millions of years. So you are both actually correct.""

Yeah, I knew my cousin was home schooled, but had no idea her textbook was called 'The Science of Creation', and she was literally being taught that evolution/science was false; and only what is said in the Bible is fact.

Once her dad (my OTHER Uncle) found out about the whole thing, he accused me of being a bad influence on my cousin (a year earlier I got in trouble for letting her hear a Jazz CD, and mentioning Harry Potter, which is witchcraft and satanic apparently).

**I was never allowed to play with her again during any of my visits to grandmas, out of my Uncle's fear I would corrupt her.**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR - Was forced to stop spending time with my cousin as a kid because I told her about Science.**

My gf and I had been dating for just under a year. I went away for college and she lived with her parents and two little brothers 6, 11.

When I would visit, we would have zero privacy at her house and car fun was l impossible since we didn’t have cars and she had an early curfew. The only option we had to be intimate was to wait till everyone went to sleep and to hook up in the living room. We couldn’t go to her room because her bed was squeaky AF, her dad would check in once he heard her door and she had no bedroom lock. We hooked up a few times successfully in the living room so it wasn’t that big of a deal. 

The day before our anniversary, I was extra horny and had her sit on my face as I laid down face up on the couch with my dick out. We enjoyed ourselves for about ten min until she gets up suddenly and says her dads name to me out loud. It was strange that she would say his name while I was eating her out and before it hit me I heard his voice say, “oh my god, what are y’all doing?! Let me get my bible” he forces my gf in her room and I’m left alone on the couch. 

They are in her room for about 5 minutes and I decide to pray because my parents are strict AF and I know I’m about to be in trouble. As I’m praying I feel a tap on my shoulder. I’m ready for hell but when I turn around its my GFs youngest six year old brother, up at 3am. I was like wtf is going on tonight. Anyways, he asks if I had a tummy ache because of my kneeling praying position. I say no and he literally skips back to bed (I suspected he was gay at 6 and he ended up coming out later in life). 

Eventually my GF and her dad come out of her room. Here’s where it gets interesting. He sits us down and instead of punishing us, he tells us he understands, that he isn’t mad, that it will be our secret and if my GFs mom finds out we will all be in trouble. He then proceeds to tell us how we should have planned it to avoid getting caught. That’s right, my (pastor) GFs dad explained that we should have left the kitchen light on to divert any late night walkers there and gone to the dining room so we would have had more time to sort ourselves out before anyone walked in. It was strange. 

He sits us in the dining room, tells us to have fun and goes back to bed. I’m still shaken up by what had just happened but with my oral skills at its peak, my GF wanted me to finish. I had to decline and say bye for the night before seeing her and her dad for our one year anniversary the next day (he took us to get pictures at the mall the next day). 

TL;DR: eating my GF out on the living room couch and her dad who is a pastor catching us in the act and giving us tips on the right way to avoid detection.

Edit: to clarify that my GFs dad gave tips on how to avoid detection and not how to perform the actual act.

Edit 2: formatting
We are no longer together, sadly. Thankfully we ended on good terms and can laugh about it now.

Edit 3: Yes it’s a true story and I mentioned the comment about her little brother because it randomly popped in my head as I was posting. Thinking back, that little detail of him was funny to me. I loved that kid, he was like a little bro to me and so funny. Anyways, his mannerisms even as a little boy just made me suspect he would be gay. After he asked about my tummy he kissed my leg, giggled then skipped off into the night. No offense intended just a funny side note."

We aren’t a couple, but I have feelings for him. Also, we have ridiculously incredible sexual chemistry.

I hadn’t seen him in about a month and a half as I had been traveling for work. So he comes over today. 

One thing leads to another and we’re in my bed. I’d say that we are both pretty vocal during the deed. There’s a lot of moaning and hyping each other up. So he’s saying things like “I love how you feel” and “youre beautiful” and I am hitting him back with “you are so sexy” and “you feel amazing”.

The scene of the fuckup: 
So he’s on top. I have my legs pretzeling him. My hands are cupping his neck and he is kind of doing the same. He says, “look at me...”

So I do.

And in my mind I am like I should say something dirty because we are staring into each other’s souls and it’s ridiculously sexy. 

BIG MISTAKE. 

For the record...he kept saying things like “I love how you feel” or whatever and so I was going with the same grammatical construction. 

And so I am staring him dead in the eye, as he is basically leg locked inside of me, and I tried to ask “do you love fucking me?” 

EXCEPT IT CAME OUT AS 
“Do you fucking love me?”
☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️

To which I realize what I just said and start frantically trying to explain that it’s not what I meant to say, and it’s definitely not a subconscious slip because obviously I don’t love him, but I do like him. 

Bless his heart, that he just sort of laughed it off and went back to work.

If he ever wants to see me again, I’ll be surprised.

TLDR; TIFU by trying to talk dirty but accidentally asking the man I like if he loves me, not my 😻."

As I watched it I started to think it might actually be my wife, then I turned up the volume and listened close and I start to panic. It sounds and looks just like my wife, my heart starts pounding. My stomach dropped to the floor when she looked at the camera in this moment I am convinced. Luckily at the very end of a short clip there was a like a three frame shot at the end that obviously wasn't her but I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept watching and listening and slowed it down and with the exception of those last frames it really seemed to be her. Anyways after I finished my business I just sat and waited for my wife to come home, all the while telling myself things like it's not her you're being stupid. I couldn't leave it alone so I tried looking up the actress but couldn't find the info. 

Finally my wife came home and I had to show her the clip. First she laughed, then she gasped when the girl looks up. She started to tear up and asked if perhaps she'd been drugged or something. After further inspection and some comparison of identifying markers like birthmarks and the like we concluded that it's not her but someone who looks and sounds extremely similar. I'm still trying to find out who the girl is because I'm hoping there may be some fun things to watch like a good lesbian scene. For a good hour there I thought that my marriage of ten years might have been a sham. The good thing is that it made me realize how much I love my wife and how important she is to me and my life. 

tl;dr thought my wife was cheating on me in porn movie, almost had a heart attack, turned out to be her dopplegangher


Edit; The shot is of her profile and for a moment she looks up, then back to profile and a quick look up again.  The whole clip is about a minute and a half long. It's not a professional porno it's a clip from a webcam show not at a great quality. Had the angles or quality been better the whole thing could've been avoided. 

Yes, married men watch porn, I can't believe how many people asked about that. 

Yes I'm sure it's not her. 

No,  i won't be posting the source. On the off chance someone figures out who i am, i don't want give someone i know the link to a porn that looks just like my wife.

Edit2; What I've learned from this thread is that this is a pretty common thing to happen.  

Also, to all the girlfriends in denial, idealistic 12 year olds and Christian conservatives.  Masturbation is not cheating,  neither is watching porn. Believe me, your boyfriends and husbands are much better off watching porn than being left to their own thoughts. You can have sex twice a day and still want to wank it sometimes. Just because you have a steak in the fridge doesn't mean you won't just want the ease and quick satisfaction of a bologna sandwich from time to time.

Edit3; Nobody will see this last edit but i feel like this point should be made.  If a vegetarian watches a video of someone eating a bacon sandwich and thinks that it looks tasty and enjoyable,  does that mean they're no longer a vegetarian? 
I don't think so.  Being attracted to other women does not make a man a cheater, that to me requires physical touch or emotional intimacy. If one can be condemned for their thoughts then there is no hope for any of us."

Im a 30ish year old male. My wife was 9 months pregnant at the time so I hadn't gotten any action in a while. Her choice, not mine. My wife is the only person I have ever slept with. We started dating in high school.

So on with the story.

I have always got my haircut at costcutters or sportsclips. The cheap places because I didn't really care. My wife had been going to a salon local to us for the last few years for massages, haircuts, hair color, the works. I had a bad experience at sportsclips the last time, I just didnt like the results. So she made me an appointment at her salon for me.

I showed up and was in their waiting room. The stylist comes to get me and wow, she is VERY attractive. Obnoxiously attractive.

After I sit in the chair I honestly stopped thinking about it, we were having a good conversation, about my wife actually. Yes, Im a terrible human being. Finish the haircut and go in the back room where they wash everyones hair. As she started to wash my hair I don't know what happened but it felt really good the way she was massaging my head while applying the shampoo. Cue the boner, Thankfully the way I was situated and the robe they had on me hid it pretty well...I think. I had a warm towel over my eyes.

She finishes that and then she asks if I want a hand massage, I decline because Im a guy and its just kinda awkward, especially given her attractiveness. Her reaction was kinda odd, she seemed shocked I didn't want one. She asked again if I was sure and I felt I might offend her if I said no again so I agreed.

The hand massage just felt amazing. I don't know what it was but it was incredible. All of a sudden I start getting little twitches in my penis for lack of a less obnoxious word for it. I couldn't stop them, they just kept building.

Then she goes to switch hands, grabs the lotion and puts the bottle down on my stomach, which slides down and ever so slightly touches my penis. That was the final straw and it happened. Next thing I know Im in a full or orgasm and I cant stop it.

I end up crossing my legs to further hide the fact that my penis and groin area are having seizures basically. Im so embarrassed, I had no idea what to do. My semen is soaking into my boxers and it's a terribly gross feeling.

I don't think she knew what was going on, thank god. She finished the hand massage and I have the most awkward walk of my life back to her chair. I basically shut down at that point and tried to rush the rest of the appointment. Im sure I was bright red at this point from embarrassment. We finish the appointment and I go to the cashier to check out. Im an epic moment of good judgement I decide to give her an obnoxious tip on top of it. I think it was $50 on a $50 bill. Yes, I am an idiot and if she did know, I just made it a million times more awkward.

I went home, avoided my wife and went straight into the shower, hid my clothes and put them in the washer right after my shower.

I have never been back and have made due with my subpar haircuts from my local sports clips since. My wife doesn't know. Telling her this story a week from her due date could have gone literally any direction and telling her now would just be even more awkward.

So there's my story, judge all you want. I am aware I am an idiot and did multiple things to make it worse. I feel like I sexually harassed her or something. I hate myself but not enough to dwell on it lol  


&#x200B;

Q&A: Some people took things too literal or didn't get my attempts at humor. Shortened because I realized idgaf about some of the sensitive sallies in this post.

Yes, I used the word obnoxious 3 times, and again in my tldr. Now I have used it 5. Sometimes a word gets stuck in my head and I use it too much. May hell rain down on me for my sins.

I did not mean obnoxiously attractive as a bad thing and yes I intentionally used the word wrong. I just found it to be a funny way to describe my reaction. ""She was so attractive it was almost offensive"" maybe would have been better choices? idk, it was a joke.  


&#x200B;

Parting words as I probably wont be back to this thread. To the people trying to blame my wife for not bending over backwards to make sure I am sexually satisfied, in the best way possible, please piss off. My wife was pregnant and going through a lot. Thinking that she should drop everything to rub one out for me is pretty fucked up. If I was to the point where I needed something I would just rub one out myself like a normal person. I didn't feel sexually deprived, I had much more important things on my mind. Life doesn't revolve around sex for me.  


Perhaps I am more sensitive to these things. My wife was the first person who I was attracted to at more than a physical level. The only person I have ever been with. I rarely have physical contact with other women, not because I avoid it, it just doesn't happen in normal course of life. This changes nothing, I am still more attracted to my wife than any human being. Attraction is about more than physical appearance.

A few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. A social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. There were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  The latter collectively wanted us to know that they “knew” what happened, that we could “understand the tragedy” better if we just talked to them. 

All of this was a lot to process in my grief, and I started going through comments and reporting them. My anger level rose and before long I convinced myself that if I just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they’d lay off. That we would maybe even get an apology. As I wrote the first message, I convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. I continued writing to a few others. 

Yeah.... couldn’t have been more wrong about that. I got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. Then I started getting messages from other people I’ve never heard of. 

At the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. I assumed they were from the other side of the family, people I’d met but I just wasn’t immediately recalling them, so I obliged. They expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had “research” that they’d like to share. One pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. Thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. 

I continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they’d gleaned about the death from me. I eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn’t out there in any easy to find place.  One person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of “facts” about the death including a section on how my loved one’s death can further their cause politically. I couldn’t even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. It’s been months, and still I’m being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. 

I’ve learned my lesson and don’t respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have I for a while.  I haven’t mentioned this to any of my family members because we’re all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; I just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. 

TL;DR Anti-Vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since I tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one


Edit - A few takeaways:
* To those that reached out with similar experiences, I have been mortified to learn that this wasn’t unique to me. Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  I wish each of you the very best. 
* To those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. Genuinely. That’s a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it’s been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. 
* I regret the user name I chose for this post and the wording of my TL;DR. I do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don’t.  The people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  I’m going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as I can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise."

I happen to like a well manicured booty. Normally, I use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. I do this every couple of weeks or so.

The downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. I was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. ""You should let me nair your butt."" Said she, with a gleam in her eyes. ""Its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.""

""Well, okay."" Says I.

Elated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. Marriage is strange. A few minutes later, I wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. I mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. It was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. I finally understood what that Santara song was about. All was good in the world. Or so I thought.

The next day I noticed some slight itchiness, but I figured it would pass, so I just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as I could. Later that night, my wife and I got undressed and got in the shower together. We were having an unrelated conversation, when I remembered the itchiness I had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. ""Well turn around so I can take a look."" So I turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.

...

Dead silence. 

I turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. I craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and I was met with a horrifying sight. Like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was COVERED in huge, bright red bumps. Unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while I jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. Overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.

My wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as I did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.

I maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.

Moral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. 

TL;DR: I let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like Freddy Kruger face fucked a topographical map of Utah."

We were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. It was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.
So here I am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden I hear a very loud *POP* immediately followed by one of the worst pain I ever felt. It felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. 

Thanks to my godlike reflexes I was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum I also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. I was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when I realised.. I can't move my jaw. I started to panic and just kept repeating ""I can't open my mouth! I can't open my mouth!"".

We tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain I can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... 

Yup, I managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.

In a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, I tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. At the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, I took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. I ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. 

When I woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer I finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and I can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can I close it completely. It being Sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so I decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. So here I am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what I am going to say to the doctor or how do I explain to my boss why I need a day off in such short notice.

Tl,Dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the T-Rex after King Kong was done with it.

EDIT/UPDATE: first of all... Holy sh** this blew up! I'm glad I could make so many of you chuckle. Also, I've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.

To answer a couple topics I found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. 

What was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. Problem is, my country is not very big on English and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. First operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in English, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in English... I then insisted to ""f**k that, it'll be fine"".

I am not from the us, just very stupid. Health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the ER because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an I was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did I think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.

After a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic I was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because I was not able to answer loud enough. He instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. Showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.

Hopefully it will heal alright and I can go back to finish what I was doing originally.

Oh, and bless those who noticed the username. I did make this account to post this story. Wasn't sure how it would look on my main."

I saw a young woman on the train whom I thought was cute. I don’t know how to safely approach people with the covid situation and I was getting off at the next stop so I made a note telling her I thought she was cute with my number and airdropped it to the name that came up when she took out her phone. She looked at me and smiled (I think, harder to tell with masks) and texted me as I was walking through the station saying that she thought i was cute too. I was excited! Then she asked me how old I was and my heart sank, thinking “oh no she’s 19 or 20 or something, younger than I thought”. I told her my age: 29. She then revealed that she’s 15. I was horrified and before I could finish my text of “I’m so sorry, I thought you were an adult, it’s hard to tell with the mask, I’m going to block your number now”, she said “i love ur glasses tho ur a major dilf” and I just about threw up, then collected myself and gave her a little spiel about please don’t say things like that to grown men (made it clear I’m not victim blaming), most wont but there are some who will act on that and that’s a terrifying thought. Anyway I think I handled it decently well but ugh that was brutal and I still feel so embarrassed. 

TL;DR I hit on someone who turned out to be 15, she called me a dilf, and I want to melt into the ground never to be seen again

Edit: for the ppl saying “why didn’t you smash” and stuff like that, even if you’re joking you’re part of the problem, seriously think about what sleeping with a full on adult at that age could do to a person and don’t perpetuate or participate in that behaviour. Please!"

April 2020. 1 month into lockdown, it seemed like we were going to work from home at least until the summer (lol). I decided to invest in a good office chair with lumbar support.

Chair arrives, I build it with wifey, and much to my dismay, the seat is angled forward so it feels like you're sitting on the cliff Mufasa fell from. It was impossible to stay seated on the chair without sliding forward and curving your spine in a weird way. I figure it's shoddy manufacturing and incorporate a footstool to my set up so I don't fall from the chair. It's uncomfortable, but I make do with my creation and keep my pride intact.

Fast forward to 9 months later, and wifey decides to get a chair of her own. She shows me the chair she picked out and claims that it is much better than my Mufasa chair. Dejected, I pull up my past orders to see the reviews on my chair to see what went so wrong. 

Multiple comments on its fantastic lumbar support. It seems no one else is sliding off of this chair. I'm confused. A light bulb flickers in my brain and I hold up a photo of the chair in the Amazon listing next to the real thing.

Turns out the bottom base of the chair frame is reversed in the photo, which meant that I built the chair backwards in April and have been sitting in a reverse chair for 9 months. Laughing uncontrollably, we reassemble the chair and take turns sitting. We now have 2 comfortable chairs.

TLDR: Bought chair in April, seat angle sucks. 9 months later wife makes fun of my chair, discover I have been working from a misassembled chair since the beginning of the pandemic.

Edit: here's the [chair](https://imgur.com/gallery/lHpmkqS) - with an eloquently written review

Edit 2: Several requests for the link to the chair- [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XDCG988?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

Edit 3: Unfortunately, no pictures of the chair before we reassembled. If you see the leg portion of the chair like a sideways U, the concave was facing backwards instead of forwards, tilting the seat forward and flexing in the front.

Edit 4: seems like my final FU in this whirlwind journey was not arranging a kickback with the chair manufacturer before posting. For the 'ride-til-I-die' wheelists, I got a sled chair because we were living in a tiny NYC apartment with cheap floors. My chair preferences also changed after 5 yrs in the military and turning 31. Thanks for the votes and the awards!"

I was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. Talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. Just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.
Well, after some cuddling, I noticed that his morning wood wasn’t gone. At all. And even though we had some amazing sex last night, I decided I wanted more. He was just so sexy, laying in his bed, I couldn’t resist.

After some teasing, we went to do it. We’re pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. Ya know, nothing too wild. But I want it quick and kinda rough.

While we were doing it, I’m telling him to speed up, even though I know he is tired from yesterday. And he does.

Suddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. Okay, I thought, it will go away. It will be fine. It’s just a cramp. Let’s continue. Right?

Wrong.

He stopped. His face looked like he was in a lot of pain. His whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. And he was still  inside of me.

Then he told me:”Babe? I can’t move. It hurts. I think I’m gonna need help.”

Well.

I had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. I also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. 

The best part? Trying to put his pants up, so he won’t be totally naked when the fucking ambulance I had to call will arrive. The whole time he was almost screaming from pain.

The REALLY best part? Trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone “Yeah, I did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.”

Now he is stuck in bed for a week and I’m wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.

TLDR; My vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.

Edit: Guys, the TLDR was a sarcasm and a joke.

Edit 2: Aaaand he laughs about it now too. He was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked. He also saw this post before I submitted it (even told me to put it on reddit, because it is kinda funny) and is the one making most jokes about it. At the moment it was terrifying, but now he´s okay, so why shouln´t we laugh about it?"

I (24f) had my sister (30f) over for a bit and we sat in my room just chatting while I folded clothes. 

When she went to sit down on my bed, I immediatly remembered I had left my vibrator under the sheets where she was about to plop down. 

No time to react, just realization then her face changed and we heard a silent *brrrrrrrrr*

She just looked at me and reached under the sheets, promptly yeeting my vibrator across the room. 

This isn't the first time my siblings and I have run across each other's toys so we kind of laughed it off but the quick change from confusion to horror on her face sticks with me till this day. 

TLDR - My sister sat on and turned on my vibrator then kobe'd it across my room

ETA - Yes the vibrator is fine, it's a shibari halo and very resilient

Yesterday, there was a Magic the Gathering tournament at my local hobby shop.  My girlfriend decided to tag along and come support me.  I ended up doing pretty poorly (1-3), but the hobby shop gave out a consolation prize of a random foiled uncommon card.  The card that I received was called ""Thought Erasure"" and immediately held the card up to my girlfriend and said ""AND I CAST THOUGHT ERASURE, BE GONE THOT!"" as a joke, but said it pretty loudly.  The shop is pretty small and a lot of people caught wind of my act and needless to say my girlfriend was very embarrassed.  We're home now and she still hasn't spoken to me. I'm fucked boys.


Tl;DR: Casted Thot Erasure on my girlfriend and now I'm afraid it may have worked.

To help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. While I was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.

“Now, the girl in front of you is a dork. Please don’t make fun of her.”

Hearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl’s defence. The teacher had just called her a dork, and I thought this was extremely mean. So I tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:

“That’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with that. In fact, I used to be one too!” After admitting this to my teacher I was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl I quickly added, “But then I grew out of it.”

The teacher gave me the most puzzled look I have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.All the kids came in and sat down at their desk and I looked up at the girl in front of me and realized I had misheard what my teacher said. The girl wasn’t a dork; she was a dwarf. I had just told the teacher I used to be a dwarf, but I had grown out of it.

tl;dr Misheard the teacher and then told her I used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.

The other day my stomach was acting funky. I didn’t think about it too much because my stomach always acts funky because I haven’t had my gallbladder for 5 years now. 

That night my fiancé and I decided to sleep nude. Around 3AM I woke up to an upset stomach. I felt something wet in my bed, but just assumed it was sweat. When I went to the bathroom it was straight butt piss. While I was in there, I realized why my bed was wet. I had shit my bed. And then came another realization. I had to clean up my bed, and wake up my fiancé and tell him what happened and why I had to change the sheets. 

I woke him up and told him was happened. I was about to cry I was so embarrassed. This man has seen me at my literal worst, but nothing could beat this. I felt so nasty. I kept apologizing because it was so early and it was absolutely disgusting. He looked me dead in the eyes and said “Its okay, babe!! Shit happens!” 🤦‍♀️

As the two of us were making out on her bed, she wanted to know if I ever mixed sex with shrooms. I shrugged and said I've never done drugs, period. She looked at me like ""ooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit"".

Fast forward to her feeding me an unknown quantity of shrooms and telling me how mindblowing the sex will be. I've got no idea when I switched from sober to losing my shit, but there I was, staring at the words on my t-shirt slowly melting away.

My tinder date, who was now in full fuck mode, wasn't wasting any time undressing me. However, my attention was elsewhere. There was a hula hoop in the room that I didn't notice before. I couldn't help but stand up and use it. My tinder date couldn't stop laughing at me hula hooping with no pants on. Not gonna lie, I was living my best life at that moment. I never wanted the hula hooping to stop. 

My tinder date was not about that life though. Eventually she grew tired of watching me hula hoop and pulled me back to bed for some fucky fucky. We made out for like 30 seconds before I ended up hula hooping again. My tinder date got frustrated and tossed the hula hoop in the closet. She took off her bra and asked if I wanted to play or hook up.

I said hula hoop.

She thanked me for wasting her time and her mushrooms before asking me to leave. Now I have to live with the fact that I chose hula hooping over sex.

Public-speaking anxiety up the wazoo, so I decided to memorize my 17 students' names and faces before the first day of class.

By Wednesday of the second week, I had everyone's FACE down pat. But everything else in the classroom was an adrenaline-filled blur.

On that day, students were picking out an advertisement to analyze (flashback to freshmen college English class, everybody). When I opened  up the discussion, I was surprised when one of quieter students (let's  call him David) told me he'd already chosen his ad.

Me, ""That's great, David, which one did you choose?""

David, ""The Wounded Warrior ad.""

Me, cheerfully oblivious, ""And why did you choose that one, David?""

The classroom suddenly goes silent. No one's rustling papers or texting  under their desk anymore. I realize every single wide eye in the  classroom is staring at me or glancing uncomfortably at David. David looks at me, and shifts his legs. His legs. With numbing horror, I  register the glint of metal between his sneakers and the hem of his jeans. David doesn't have any legs. In my state of stage-fright, I'd somehow missed that one of my students is a double-amputee.

The silence in the classroom deafens.

Finally, David, quietly - ""I lost my legs in the Army, ma'am.""

TL;DR - Failing to notice his missing legs, I publicly questioned my (Army vet) student's choice to write about the Wounded Warrior Project.

**Edit**: Many incredibly kind people are saying this wasn't a fuck up. But I should have noticed. I walk around and interact with every student. Sure, maybe I accidentally treated David \*just like any other person,\* but he got embarrassing unwanted attention from everyone in the room because I was an idiot. But many thanks for the kindness."
kzruu1,TIFUpdate: I complimented my date’s butt by mistake and now we’re going on a second date,26609,0.89,795,2021-01-18 15:37:37,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kzruu1/tifupdate_i_complimented_my_dates_butt_by_mistake/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/kzruu1/tifupdate_i_complimented_my_dates_butt_by_mistake/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I am trying to link back to my original post, but I can’t figure it out on mobile — please someone help.

Thanks for all the comments, not to mention all of the perspectives I definitely did not consider. 

A few clarifications: 

I haven’t dated since before dating apps were a thing and I was married for 7 years so please give me some grace for being Very Bad At This.

We went on an outdoor date (a walk on the boardwalk near where we live) and didn’t so much as hug. Wore masks anytime we were close to other people (turns out not many people walk outside at night when it’s 40 degrees, though). 

Both he and I have kids, so the “single mom, run for the hills” thing goes both way, right?

My intended text wasn’t the exact phrase “thanks, you’re great” — I think that would be super rude! I would have been kind and appropriate (had I not instead just written “that ass” but, here we are.)

No, I don’t know why my phone autocorrected to “that ass.” I am glad it makes people think I have a much more interesting life and Google search history than I do!

Finally, the update: 

He sent me back a link to the music video for “Mr. Jones.” I do not know if this was also an accidental text or if I’m missing some symbolism here. Counting Crows fans, please advise. 
  
We then chatted about the Cleveland Browns as if nothing weird had happened. 

In any case, I decided the universe (and Reddit) was facilitating enough rom-com vibes (and “don’t be so quick to judge” comments) that I might as well go on one more date with a nice, friendly dude, with, for what it’s worth, a pretty decent butt. 

Tl;dr I am seeing that ass again."
nj8ldo,TIFU by masturbating in the shower,26605,0.86,783,2021-05-23 19:44:41,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nj8ldo/tifu_by_masturbating_in_the_shower/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nj8ldo/tifu_by_masturbating_in_the_shower/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"This morning I fancied a bit of me time. I’d done some exercise and was feeling pretty good about myself. I decided to try something different and bring my vibrator into the shower with me. Kill two birds with one stone and all that! Mistake number 1. 

I soaped myself off and fired up my toy. The vibration is quite quiet so I could enjoy myself without my partner in the next room knowing. I decided to lift my leg to get better ahem access... the shower is a small cubicle so not much room for movement so I rested my sole against the wall in front of me and leaned back on the wall behind me. Mistake number 2. 

As things heated up, I seemed to forget where I was. The stream of the hot water and sensational vibrations eventually drove me to the edge. My standing leg began to tremble but I didn’t think too much about it, until the big O hit. I don’t know if was just the difference in location or feeling of standing up masturbating that threw me off, but it was a veryyyy strong orgasm and I felt lightheaded. I must have lost balance because next thing I know the foot beneath me slid forward suddenly and I’m clattering to the shower floor. I hit my head, tried to grab anything at all, knocked the stuff off the shelf and must have cried out a little. 

With all the commotion, my partner came running. Before I could say I was ok don’t come in he ran into the bathroom to help me. It took him a good few seconds to see my vibrator and stared at my crumpled corpse putting two and two together. Needless to say his look of concern turned to amusement as he burst out laughing at my solo shower sex fail. 

I’m ok! My lower back and elbow hurts a bit from how hard I hit the floor and I have a slight headache but I think I’ll survive. He’s taking care of me in between our hysterics. Heed my warning, guys, play safe in the shower. Don’t be like me and have an orgasm which literally knocks you off your feet. 

Tl;dr tifu by trying to be sneaky and play with myself in the shower but instead slipped and made it a bigger deal than it needed to be."

**List of fuck ups I've experienced so far - the 2019 issue:**

1.

Mispronounced my new girlfriend's name when I introduced her to old friends of mine.

2.

Dropped an F bomb during an important job interview when I accidentally bit my own tongue.

3.

Ignored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. 

4.

Changed my Instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized I misspelled 'genius' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. 

5.

Unknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. 

6.

Speaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time I had to call my best friend for a helping hand: I said no homo, he did not). 

7.

Took a random ride on my younger cousin's BMX bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by BMX).

8.

Suffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before I had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. 

9.

Visited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. The bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and I freaked the fuck out. I dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. It survived, but my sister in law made damn sure I didn't.

I'm currently deployed in the middle east. We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You'll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That's when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.





TL;DR I microwaved a chef boyardee with the metal top on creating a small spaghetti bomb surrounded by a bunch of trigger happy marines Creating a really world close quarters drill."
koxg9z,TIFU by finding a lifeless body while breaking in a school illegally,26557,0.85,771,2021-01-02 18:56:49,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/koxg9z/tifu_by_finding_a_lifeless_body_while_breaking_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/koxg9z/tifu_by_finding_a_lifeless_body_while_breaking_in/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"so as in every post, this happened several years ago. i will try to keep the story as short as possible

so me and a friend have the great tradition of breaking in a school once a year. we use to go into the school in the evening, then hide in two lockers until everyone left. then we usually have a great time by ourselves drinking and eating snacks. 
there have been a few occasions, where really crazy stuff happened, but the wildest one is this: 
we just came out of the lockers and wanted to start the party. as we walked down the stairs to get our booze, we saw what we thougt was a dead boby outside the building. to give some context, it was nighttime and winter, so dark and cold af. we are at that point kind of panicking. we cant call the police and tell them where we have seen the body??
so we put a little stone between the door, so we can come in again later, bc we had all our stuff in the school. we go on the roof of the school, where you can go to even when the school is closed. luckily, the body is also visible from there, it lays like on the edge of the roof, but not a roof where you should go, like further down. 
so we call the police and tell them we saw a body. a few minutes later, the police, firemen and an ambulance arrive. they get the 'body'. its a boy, around 14 years of age. he is drunk af, cant respond to them and has a broken collarbone and is under normal temperature. 
they take him to the hospital and begin to ask us stuff. we lie a lot bc they ask us why we are here, where we have seen him etc. they even brought a detective, who should ask us seperatly, so were in a reeally dumb situation, bc we didnt talk about an alibi. 
so we tell them that we really wanna go home, were so tired etc, and they let us go. all the police cars etc are standing right in front of the door we put a stone in between... in a brief moment, we sprint to the door and run inside again, where we drank ourselves to sleep

so yeah turns out the boy was drinking with his friend. his friend fell asleep, meanwhile he fell down the roof. his friend wakes up, cant see him and decides to go home, what left the boy in the cold, asleep/ unconcious.

moral of the story: something a little illegal can save someones life!

TL ; DR i broke in a school, saw a liveless body out of the window, on the roof. had to lie to the police a bit, then snuck inside the school again and drank booze

bfolyl,TIFU by playing a Jackbox game with my girlfriend’s family,26549,0.91,657,2019-04-21 18:36:32,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bfolyl/tifu_by_playing_a_jackbox_game_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bfolyl/tifu_by_playing_a_jackbox_game_with_my/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"A little background: my girlfriend’s family is extremely conservative. Like goes-to-church-twice-every-Sunday-and-never-swears conservative. While they are really nice people, it’s a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...

So earlier tonight, my girlfriend’s family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... 

After choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN’T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit “submit,” on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I’ve experience before.

I panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. 

The game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don’t say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I’m doing my best not to explode inside.

The game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, “What? You don’t want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.”

Safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn’t the one for me. 

TL;DR: I played Jackbox’s Drawful with my girlfriend’s family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend’s sheltered, conservative family...


EDIT: the comment about her not being the one for me was sarcastic. We’ve been together for almost two years. I’m just mortified to show my face to her dad for a while"

I have this super sweet but incredibly obnoxious cat, she meows at the top of her lungs in an almost ear drum rupturing yodel that sounds like she's trying to summon a demon. [This is Luna](https://imgur.com/a/HCfC8aL)   


She does this basically for every reason possible, food, pets, treats, outside, play time, cuddles you name it. At first we thought she was injured or sick, so we took her to the vet, they told us that she is fine and just naturally talkative, and that we'll have to suffer then he said  ""now please get her out of here I can't take it anymore"" jokingly of course.  


So here is the fuck up, I've resorted to saying, *shut up cat!* or just *shut up!*, little did I know that me saying this so many times would cause her to now respond to this as her name. So we now have to call her by ***shut up*** in order to get her to come......... so later down the line my friend came over and I saw my cat and yelled ***shut up!***, and he then looked at me like I was a total asshole, and said, ""if I'm annoying you I can just leave"" I had to then explain why I said that and we had a pretty good laugh, now I have to figure out what to do about her name.   


Edit: Thank you all so meowy much for the awards I really appreciate it, but please give your money to charity instead of me. Nonetheless thank you!

  


TL;DR: I told my cat to shut up so many times that she thinks it's her name"

I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, “THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!”  
Slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, “WELCOME TO SAFEWAY!” And “THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY.” And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  
  
  After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, “You guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!”    
The manager looks at me like I’m A FUCKING MONSTER and says, “There is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn’t going ANYWHERE!”       
  
Confused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she’s crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as I walk. Then I go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

TL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   
  
EDIT - Just to clarify, I think this is HYSTERICAL now. I find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why I decided to share. I’m not going to a different store. I have no shame in going back there at all.

Home for the holidays. My family got an Amazon Alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. It used to be set up under my account, but when I moved out last year I transferred everything to my mom. It’s in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. 

Our family likes off-beat Christmas music, and I spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special Spotify playlist for us. We like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on Christmas morning. 

Here’s where the FU starts. Yesterday I wanted to play a new song I heard for my mom. I couldn’t get the Echo to find it, so I had to connect my phone via Bluetooth. The family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. I paired my phone and played the song. 

This morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, I was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. You know, relieving some stress.... with videos. Oddly enough none of the videos I stumbled upon had sound. I wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. 

When I came downstairs to say good morning and merry Christmas to the family, my sister greets me with “you need to play the playlist from your phone, I can’t get the Echo to connect to my phone.” “Okay, no problem, I’ll connect my phone.” “I was trying to connect mine, and I think yours is already connected.”

Not sure what my family heard playing over the Echo this morning, but it wasn’t my usual Christmas playlist. 

tl;dr paired my new phone to my family’s Echo yesterday. Went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and I’m pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family. "

Anyways I (26M) was feeling horny, decided to use a cucumber with a condom on as a dildo as I have been staying at my parents house for a while now and did not bring any of my adult toys. I grabbed a cucumber from the fridge, grab my poppers and went to town on my butthole. 

After I finished playing with myself, I take off the condom for easy clean up, go discreetly dispose of the evidence and shower to clean myself off. This is where the fuck up begins. I know it’s wasteful but I was going to throw away the cucumber, as it has been shoved up my ass for at least 25 minutes. As I was throwing it away my mom comes in the kitchen to start dinner. First thing she ask me is to hand her the cucumber for her to start cutting for the salad. I pretend to drop it, so I can wash it for use but still. I won’t get the thought I ate my cucumber dildo with my family.

It’s not even a big deal, I made sure to throughly wash it. I was imagining it sliding in and out of my butt

TLDR: my family and I ate my cucumber dildo

Edit since some people are asking, “poppers” is an Inhalant sold at adult stores that make you feel dizzy and light headed for a couple minutes but sex feels amazing.

Edit 2: everyone’s saying I deleted my post history, yeah, my account is a throwaway to share mydeepestdarkest stuff. I delete posts over time to remain anon. Especially when you make front page

Edit:3 since no one believes me shoving a cucumber up my ass, I will go find a nice one tomorrow or a Similar size but plug. 

Edit4 since everyone’s hating and saying this a repost, I would love to see a Reddit post like mine, other than a porn clip.

It was my university's homecoming this weekend, so everybody was getting super drunk and just having a good time. During the day, my one housemate told me she was gonna be bringing someone home that night which I was totally fine with.

By the time she brought him over, I was in my bed trying to fall asleep. Her room is right beside mine so I was already thinking that I would be able to hear them, but I just figured they would try to be quiet. Once they got to her room, I could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. Me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, I decided ""I'll just put on my Bluetooth headphones so I can't hear them."" Now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. I saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn't bother checking that it was my headphones.

I opened Instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn't playing audio. I thought my phone volume was low so I turned it all the way up. I was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. By the time I realized my headphones weren't playing audio, it was too late; the Monsters Inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. I promptly disconnected my phone and I hear a bang on my wall following a scream of ""LEGOGH\_, IS THAT YOU FUCKING WITH MY SPEAKER?!?"" I was speechless, I didn't say anything because I couldn't believe what had just happened.

It turns out that earlier in the day, I had connected to her speaker to play music and that's what my phone auto-connected too. After the guy left her room, I tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that I intentionally did it. They didn't even finish having sex because I killed the mood, and now she's extremely pissed off at me.

TLDR; accidentally connected to my housemates Bluetooth speaker while she was having sex and I watched a meme with the monsters inc. theme in it

EDIT: she isn't mad anymore, my other housemates brought it up last night and we all had a good laugh

EDIT2: Broke it into paragraphs for an easier read

EDIT3: Also to clarify, it was [the earrape version](https://youtu.be/IRP-2y43BLo) of the theme song"

Due to various complications, we had opted for a planned C-section. The whole thing in general was just really bizarre, like, you pick your kid's birthday just like that! Anyway, my wife and I tend to be goofy, fun loving folk that's always up for a laugh. We do a lot of silly things together to make each other laugh, though as with most men, I tend to meander into the dumber territory more often as you will soon hear;

On the day of the birth, just as we were about to leave to the hospital, I picked up this fishbowl style lamp shade (looked something like [this](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/images/products/jakobsbyn-pendant-lamp-shade-clear-glass__0683771_PE720859_S5.JPG?f=s)) we hadn't yet put up onto my head because ""we're boldly going where neither of us have gone before"". I just saw it on my way to the door and didn't really think it through, so I immediately regretted this decision when my giant ears, my nose and hair (got down to my ass length hair that was in a loose bun) ended up blocking my head in this thing and I couldn't get it off. We tried for a bit, and my wife was understandably over it pretty quick because we were going to be late for our baby appointment, so I made the executive decision to not make the situation any more stressful than it should've been (too late) and to just drive to the hospital with this on my head and hope that someone at the hospital might have some idea what I should do.

As you can imagine, the car ride was a real mix bag of emotions for us all.

We arrive, I do the walk of shame into the maternity ward with this bubble on my head holding my wife's hand and there's this older nurse who greeted us and I could see her dinner plate eyes just screaming ""what the fuck...""and my wife jokingly said ""....Yep! I'm having *his* baby!"" to which literally all the midwives in the maternity ward that could see us walk up the corridor just start howling with laughter and whoever was not visible poked their heads round the corner to see this fucking spectacle. My wife was then ushered into a room where they monitored the baby and her. A nurse (who was this massive, buff tattooed dude, by the way, so imagine that) took me to another one of those inspection rooms and got the thing off with some sort of lube/gel.

Anyway, 4 hours later, we had a healthy baby and I got hazed by some of the older midwives. It was really good fun in the end. Wouldn't recommend, but it definitely beats any other birth story I've heard AND broke the ice with most of the staff.

**TL;DR: I got a bowl shaped lamp shade stuck on my head and had to take my wife to the hospital to have our baby whilst I had the bowl removed.**

P.S. For those of you wondering how I got it on in the first place, here's some handy dandy instructions in case you want to give it a go; get the bun in first, then move downwards over the ears, the nose and then push down until the ears get into the rim. The bun will smoosh up inside and move downwards a bit and voila! You're a jackass!

Edit: Eish. Glad you guys found this so amusing. I don't know what these awards do, but I've never gotten one on my main before, so thanks for handing them to me. Also, thanks for all being so swell. I honestly was expecting people to just call me an idiot, but I've gotten some really lovely messages from some of you."
acwflt,TIFU by showing my Tinder date's mom my bare ass.,26500,0.84,1009,2019-01-05 23:31:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acwflt/tifu_by_showing_my_tinder_dates_mom_my_bare_ass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acwflt/tifu_by_showing_my_tinder_dates_mom_my_bare_ass/,self.tifu,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"Obligatory it happened a month ago. 

I started hooking up with this guy from Tinder. He lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. 

We decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one Saturday night. The munchies kicked in around 2AM so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. Came back and spooned to sleep. 

I wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. This, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30AM.  

Midway through it, we heard his apartment's main door open. Tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. I was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. Ass visible, in all it's glory. 

Now I was still under the impression that his room's door was locked. I was wrong. His mother opened the door and I swear she had the same expression as the shocked Pikachu meme. :o

She immediately closed the door. I ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. 

Turns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. 

I left as soon as she left.

She later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. She asked him if I was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that ""we're just two friends trying to figure things out"". 

Spoiler: we ended up dating. Thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying ""hi, I'm *****, Tinder guy's mom. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met."" (Chuckles). 

Tl;dr: Tinder date and I got too baked and forgot to lock the room. Woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude's mum. And that's the story of how my now SO's mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.

PS:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. 

Edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

Edit 2: holy shit I can't believe this blew up. My account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. Man I love Reddit. 

Edit 3: This one's more like a clarification. I live in a non first world country where it's fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. His mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. She had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. WE were dumbasses. 

Calm yer titties Reddit. "

But i just found out recently.

I dated a girl when I was about 19. I was a late bloomer and had only been with one girl before that. We had a great time and had tons of fun. We understood each other perfectly.

One day I invited her over and things got pretty hot real quick. I was going down on her and then it happened. I came in my underwear. I was so ashamed and my reaction was to try to hide it. I said i had to go to the bathroom to get the condom (which was true). I cleaned myself up and rushed back.

Now, it takes a while for me to reload. I am like a musket, not a machine gun. So she said now its her turn to please me. My little guy did not react. A combination of nature and shame made it impossible for me to get hard.

Trying to play it cool I told her I was somehow not in the mood and we should just chill for a bit. She said ok but the night was ruined.

After that contact dwindled and she ended up moving.

Almost 13 years later we ran into each other! It was awesome. This girl is great! We are now over 30 and doing very well in life. We hit it off right away and went for a drink.

We started joking about the past and we started talking about that night. She then tells me she really liked me and wanted a relationship with me! She was just so ashamed that she couldnt get me hard and thats why she didn't contact me anymore! Fml. I started laughing and told her the truth, i jizzed my pants while going down on her. After that we couldn't stop laughing.

Unlucky for me, she has a boyfriend and was moving to his country in the next days.

So bois, if you jizz your pants, be honest about it! Girls might be flattered!

Tldr; jizzed my pants while going down on a girl i really liked. Tried to hide it from her. Couldn't get hard for sex. She thought I didnt like her because I couldn't get hard."
wrbt12,TIFU by opening my fiancé's dms,26486,0.67,3846,2022-08-18 11:41:38,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/wrbt12/tifu_by_opening_my_fiancés_dms/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/wrbt12/tifu_by_opening_my_fiancés_dms/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"The wound is still fresh so bear with me. 

**The Discovery**

I had a rough day and my fiancé's algorithms are top notch, so I was scrolling through his apps to entertain myself hoping for a pick me up. He went to take a shower. I opened his Instagram (got bored with Reddit, so sorry) and noticed he had a couple new dms. We don't snoop through each other's phones, but we don't hide anything either (or so I thought) so I clicked on them just to see if they were important because he doesn't check Insta that often. 

WELL. I see the dms are from a deleted account???, thus sparking my interest. So I click, and I scroll. Messages go *years* back--maybe twenty to thirty messages total. Some winky faces, some slightly sexual memes, and a few photos of lingerie. Nothing outright incriminating but... *who is this bitch*? My heart dropped. We're getting married in less than five months. These messages aren't okay. He's not a cheater??? Never once have I questioned that, nor has he given me any reason to. I start to see red.

**The Confrontation**

I put on my big girl pants, wipe my tears, and storm into the bathroom. Rip open the shower curtain, revealing this idiot's (albeit glorious) naked body. He, though quite startled, raises his eyebrows and smirks. ""Looking to join?"" He says. Wrong move buddy. 

I go off. You know, like a badass.

He denies it. You know, like a liar. 

I hold his towel hostage and toss him his phone so he can see for himself. He scrolls and pulls off this wildly confused demeanor. I literally see the blood leave his face. He just kinda says stuttering ""...baby I don't know?"" 

We go back and forth. He swears up and down he has no idea who this could be. ""I'm just as surprised as you are!!!"" He claims, criminally. So, I take his phone so I can quote this ""other woman"" for emphasis.

**The Reveal**

I ready my best valley girl voice and scroll to the most recent received messages. I notice for the first time, inconveniently so, a picture *she* sent of a Guinea pig. I think, ""Aw hell, I love Guinea pigs."" Then I remember... *I have seen this Guinea pig before*.

Then I realize. *She* is me. 

I deleted all my social media almost a year ago. Neither of us remembered any of the messages we sent. I start laughing and happy crying. My fiancé looks as if he just won the lottery and received the death penalty simultaneously.

**The Aftermath**

Now we sit, *both* recently showered, debating whether or not we should welcome a Guinea pig into our family. I am so embarrassed. He is so relieved. We are crazy, stupid, and so in love.

TLDR; Found cheating-indicating messages on my fiancé's phone. Turns out it was my old deleted account. I'm an idiot. He's a keeper.

Edit: Didn’t wanna edit because I didn’t wanna make the hate worse. My fiancé commented somewhere in here a few minutes ago, I just picked up my phone & WOW was not expecting all this. I did apologize to him fully, and I’m sorry I didn’t know I should’ve included that. Most posts I read on here don’t usually include a full resolution. I wrote this quickly not expecting it to blow up. Looking back I would’ve changed a lot of my wording. I could defend myself for a lot of things but that likely wouldn’t help. All of this story is true, it was so odd which is what prompted me to post it. He’s not leaving me, there’s so much more to our lives than this. I didn’t assault him. We are naked at home more than we’re clothed. You’re all not in my relationship, but I can tell you that him being in the shower was not a violating aspect. He was annoyed, but not hurt or degraded. I’ve never blown up like this & intend never to again. I’ve also never worried or accused him before of cheating. This was my first experience and I didn’t know how to handle it. I understand concern for him but there’s no reason to say I deserve xyz. Not sure how to prove this story is true? But think what you will. I didn’t mean to sound so cavalier; I wasn’t very conscious of my tone of voice. I always write dramatically but understand that if you don’t know me it’s different. Wasn’t expecting to be called psychotic. Lastly thanks to the few commenters who left Guinea pig info.

Final edit only for clarity bc it got worse after my first: His comment said this but it’s lost. He handed me his phone. He goes on Instagram maybe once or twice a year? We have an open phone policy. I didn’t snoop because our boundaries are: I don’t look at texts with his mom, brother, or therapist. He doesn’t look at my texts with my sister, brother, therapist, or best friend. I don’t have social media besides Reddit & he’s rarely active on his. To my knowledge, the boundaries we set have never been broken by either of us. 
The lingerie pics weren’t of me. They were pics he sent to me that he thought I’d like. 
I wrote this using the exact language of my thoughts in the moment. Sorry if it’s cringy but it’s accurate for what I was feeling/thinking. I’m not a creative writer & I’m not trying to be. 

And disclaimer: if you keep stigmatizing mental illness like you are I’m going to delete this if I can. I’m not here for karma I’m here cause today I fucked up. It’s absolutely horrible to use illnesses to describe behavior in such hateful ways, please think about the people you could hurt, besides me, who might read your hate & feel shame because of it."
9ldaew,TIFU by not knowing courtrooms had dress codes.,26464,0.89,1842,2018-10-04 21:41:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9ldaew/tifu_by_not_knowing_courtrooms_had_dress_codes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9ldaew/tifu_by_not_knowing_courtrooms_had_dress_codes/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,,False,"For those of you that are as unaware as I am, don’t wear shorts, flip flops, or hats into court. I went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw “NO SHORTS, FLIP FLOPS, HATS, UNTUCKED SHIRTS...” in bold letters on the door. Fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. Unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and I haven’t been a size 32 since high school... I’m a big guy who’s been “blessed” with thick thighs (heard they’re in style). These slacks were so tight, I couldn’t zip them past the first rung. All I could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. These things looked like yoga pants on me.

I’d guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. I was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. One lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. I said “Ma’am, if I bend my legs I’ll bust these pants wide open.” She looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. 

After the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. He allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (WIN). Everyone before me requested a conference. I was fourth to be called. 

Judge: “QTVain how do you plea?”

Me: “Guilty, sir. I would just like to pay my ticket.”

Judge: “Alright, that’s 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.”

Me: *panicking* “Uh yes, sir”

As I’m waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that I looked like a bum off a three day bender. Flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you’ve ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. I’m starting to hear people fighting back laughter as I walk by every damn bench.

Judge: “Didn’t meet the dress code huh?”

Me: “Sir, these people behind me know more about my body than I do right now. I’d really like to pay my ticket and go.”

Judge: “Ha, fair enough. Get outta here.”

I waddled out of there as quickly as I could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. Told my wife what happened when I got home. “Yah I thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, I was going to tell you but forgot.”

“Thanks babe.”


TL;DR Check your local courts dress code before attending. I didn’t, and wore the wrong attire. 

Edit: Hey y’all, I get it. I should have thought about it. I’m just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. Can we not be so hostile? I was just trying to show the judge a little leg.

Edit 2: I’m trying to respond to all of y’all asking me questions. To further clarify, I thought I had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, I didn’t actually believe I had to see the judge. I was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. Hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.

Edit 3: Thank y’all for the gold! I’ve honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. Reddit, you’re beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). I tried to respond to as many of you as I could. My fingers are actually hurting now. I’ll comment more tomorrow. "

I get a lot of pimples on my face, not a lot at once, just usually 1 or 2 that will last a week or so until I pop them or they go away. 

Every so often I get painful under-skin pimples, to the point you can actually see the lump in my skin, but no pimple/red/white head. I usually get them near my nose or on my neck, but this time I got one right next to my ear. 

Unlike previous ones, this one was not only extremely painful, it was also ridiculously big, I couldn't stand to see it when I looked in the mirror. It had been over a week and it showed no signs of coming to the surface, and it was giving me bad headaches and earaches so I decided to try and pop it under the skin. 

It took about an hour of unbearably painful squeezing but I finally heard a little *squish* and had instant pain relief. It was still quite sore but it no longer felt like it was going to erupt out of my face. 

Fast forward 2 days later, I was riding my bike about 25km/h on the hill past my house when all of a sudden I just fell off the bike and slid down the road on my side (leaving a considerable amount of my skin behind) 

I had no idea why I had fallen as I wasn't turning, or doing anything unusual. I hobbled home and put some antiseptic on my road rash and slept all afternoon. The next day I went to the doctor to get the road rash treated and dressed properly, while I was there he asked something that prompted me to tell him about my ""ear pimple"" situation. 

He checked my ear and told me that I had in fact not popped a pimple, but my preauricular lymph node, causing an infection in my ear which is why I had lost balance on my bike. 

I was off my bike for about a week before I started riding again (and then I stacked it and tore my MCL, but that's another story) 

TL;DR: I thought I was popping a painful pimple, but actually popped my preauricular lymph node causing an ear infection which then resulted in me badly stacking my bike"

My grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he’s soft-spoken. This paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. Since I can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said “Hey! Wanna color?” in a really fast manner. Which young me always politely declined. Throughout the years this has continued. I always said no thank you because I have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. Plus, maybe he loves coloring I mean hey, if that’s his thing then so be it even though I’ve never once seen him color.

Then last week it dawned on me. He approached me and said  **“Hey! Wanna color?”**  At least that’s what I registered at first but then I deciphered it correctly. He was actually saying  **“Hey There Young feller”**  .. I  Instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. For my entire life I have been responding to my grandpas greeting with No Thank you.. I explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man I’m never going to live this down.

EDIT: To clear things up people keep asking how would I confuse the two phrases? He talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. So the two together sound somewhat similar. For those saying this is made up I guess believe what you want? I'm not sure why I'd make up such a strange story.

Thanks for the Silver!!


Tl;DR; Grandpa has always said “Hey wanna color?” which I always responded with no thank you. He’s actually been saying “Hey there young feller”. I’ve misheard him my entire life."

Live together. She uses a flip phone for reasons that are too long to get into, so she will occasionally use my phone when she needs to check her email or download music. 

Back to my dumbass. Im not going to lie yall, I trashed my brain as a teenager. I have issues with memory, short and long. But today I woke up and was chilling for a bit while my girl was at work. Suddenly I thought ""Oh shit whats my gf's birthday"". 

I knew what month it was in, but I couldn't remember if it was the 8th or 9th. Thats okay, I thought, ill go dig around a bit. Surely theres some paper work around the house that has her birthday on it. Spoiler: there wasn't. 

Im definitely not asking her friends or family as they'll surely tell her I forgot. So I do what any reasonable guy does, and I Google background check services. Enter her name and city, and for $7.99 I receive an email with every traffic ticket, address, and phone number she's ever had. Most importantly though, her birthday. 

I write her birthday down in a safe spot and then go back to chilling. All is well. I'm not a piece of shit boyfriend, what a relief. She gets home, our day is going well, when she asks to use my phone to read her email. I completely obliviously give it to her. She opens it, and immediately she sees a full background check on herself. 

I knew exactly what happened once her face changed. She immediately asked why I was back ground checking her, a year into our relationship, and then started getting emotional, asking if I didn't trust her etc.. 

This is the first relationship I've ever not had trust issues in, so I immediately confess that I am a dumbass, I forgot her birthday, and I paid $7.99 to get it, because her sister and friends would snitch on me. Lol. 

Luckily this isn't the first time I've came off as a total moron to her, so she believed me, but she is indeed also a bit upset I forgot her birthday. Next time something like this happens I'm just admitting guilt I think. I'm also sitting here and just realized I could've waited till she was asleep and checked her license.... 

TL;DR I forgot my gf's bday, background checked her to find it out, then accidentally showed it to her on my phone, causing her to think I don't trust her."

e1ukwu,"TIFU by getting the date wrong on my flight, and consequently, missing my only chance to go home for the holidays",26374,0.88,1144,2019-11-26 12:58:07,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e1ukwu/tifu_by_getting_the_date_wrong_on_my_flight_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e1ukwu/tifu_by_getting_the_date_wrong_on_my_flight_and/,self.tifu,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"(Updates at bottom)

I’m actually crying as I write this, so forgive any errors. 

As the title says, I got the date mixed up on my flight. I was convinced it was leaving Tuesday morning, and so I spend Monday just cleaning up and packing. I was so sure I didn’t bother to properly check over the dates on the confirmation, only the times. 

I booked a flight to go home this month, because the tickets were much more affordable than winter break, and my budget is tight. I was so excited to go home, because I haven’t seen my family in months, and this week would have been the longest stretch of time. But I DIDN’T CHECK THE DATE PROPERLY. I’m so stupid. 

Before heading to bed, I checked my email once more to look over the flight details and that’s when I noticed two updates, telling me my flight has landed. Thinking it an error, I double checked the confirmation and discovered my massive fuck up. 

And here I am now, crying my eyes out after having called the airline only to discover I can’t afford the only available options. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. 

TLDR; I didn’t check the date on my flight properly, mistakenly believing it to be for the 26th, only to find out hours and hours later that it was on the 25th and I’d missed it.

Edit: Hey everyone! Wow, I did NOT expect this many responses and SO MUCH support. Thank you all so much.  

I was trying to fly from Dallas to Sacramento (currently still in Dallas), but because of my FU, that’s not happening. I’m not sure how to provide proof, but I think I should hold myself accountable. 

Initially, due to my mental health history and how my family and I can be, I was REALLY shitty about going home (major anxiety, arguments with my sister, etc because who wants to face their family after being diagnosed with x and y and spending time in a psych ward). I didn’t realize how much I wanted it/needed it until universal karma and my own carelessness took that away. I just cried myself to sleep. 

All of that to say that while I really appreciate everyone’s kindness and so much compassion, this mistake is none other than my own. If you STILL want to help, knowing about my initial shitty attitude, then I’ll gladly accept, but your goodwill may be better off with someone who deserves/needs it more. 

Again, thank you all for being so supportive and kind.

UPDATE: I’m going home! Thank you everyone for your kindness and love and support. I can’t tell express to you all what this means. 

I got help on the condition that I pay it forward through kind acts, and I absolutely will. Thank you all for showing me how much love and kindness there is to share. 

Thank you so much TheGrayBeard!

UPDATE 2: I’m home! I’m currently sitting in the back of the car as my family drives me home, sipping on a cup of tea my mom made and brought for me in a thermos. 

I just wanted to say thank you again for everyone who extended their love and support to a complete stranger. The positivity was overwhelming, and I will pass the kindness forward every chance I get. 

To those who reached out to lend an ear for my mental health, and who thanked me for being open about it, I’m so amazed and grateful for the love in the community of people who struggle themselves and those who want to help. 

I’ll try to post a family pic (probably with the faces covered for privacy) when I get a chance. 

Finally, thank you again, TheGrayBeard. You are an incredible person who started an entire chain of goodwill."

I worked at an insurance agency.  It was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  We were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. Not your typical professional environment.

One of the producers, we'll call her Lisa, had a boyfriend named Dick.  Lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with Dick was very on again off again.  At the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.

Around the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  I picked Lisa's name out of the hat.  I decided that since she and Dick weren't​ in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, I'd get her a vibrator as her gift.  This thing was thick, about 8"", black, and had a gold tip.  

So we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that Lisa got a vibrator.  We're chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  As things die down, it got put on the boss's desk.

Picture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  A woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: I have an appointment with Boss.  Boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.

The rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  There is 0% chance the woman didn't see it.  Somehow, Boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  Neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  More so, this was the woman's first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.

The lady leaves and Boss comes out red as a tomato.  He's not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  

I've always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. 

Sounds like the story is over.... not quite.  Lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  A few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look Mom, I'm shaving!

I think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.

Tl;Dr: put vibrator on boss's desk, he didn't know and conducted business with customer. Then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger(s)!
 Matches the vibrator lol."

Tonight, after a very stressful day of exams and studying for my ancient literature class, I decided to casually scroll tinder. It had been a while and I just needed to destress. Little did I know, this would cause me more stress than I could have possibly imagined. I swiped right on a girl who was less than a mile away. She was 25, a little older than me but she was super hot and she seemed into me, so I went with it. She invited me over to her apartment, and she said that she had to go in 20 minutes so make it fast. Needless to say, we got straight to business, but about three minutes after we began, we heard the front door open. She told me to stop, so I stopped and we listened. The footsteps came in our direction and I got pretty scared. I expected it would be like when my parents caught me a few years ago with my ex, and it would be embarrassment all around.  Not at all. The ancient literature professor, who I absolutely despise, and whose test I was frantically studying for, walked into the room and froze. He saw her, gasped, and then saw my face. His face turned red, and he screamed “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!” I’m pretty sure I lost some of my hearing from how loud he yelled. Anyways I put my shorts on and ran back to my quad. Now, as I lay in bed, all I can think of is how my college professor saw me naked, not just naked but rawdogging his daughter without any clothes at all. He already didn’t like me, and he is a very tough grader… So I already know that I am going to absolutely bomb this final and destroy my GPA. I see him tomorrow at 11 AM… wish me luck and I’ll update with what happens

TLDR: Professor I hate caught me with his daughter and I have his final tomorrow"
15r6buw,TIFU by sending my wife to check if a powerball ticket was a winner,23528,0.95,662,2023-08-15 02:09:10,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15r6buw/tifu_by_sending_my_wife_to_check_if_a_powerball/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15r6buw/tifu_by_sending_my_wife_to_check_if_a_powerball/,self.tifu,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened a few days ago.

I have a longstanding habit of buying a lottery ticket for the powerball (or megaball ect.) whenever it gets over 300 million. It's overall a very small amount per year and it's just a small investment in fun times from my point of view. Recently the prize was slowly creeping up due to no winners multiple weeks in a row (the prize gets rolled over if there is no winner). It was over a billion last week and I bought a ticket like usual. But I got too busy too take it in too check the numbers. 

Here is where I screwed up. I decided to give the ticket to my wife to check. Now she is a sweet lady who has never gambled anything, so she was not familiar with the process. I sent her to a local supermarket with a machine, explained how to scan the card and sent her on her merry way.

A little while later I get a strange text basically saying ""you better be sitting down!!"", and then a text saying something to the effect of ""I'm never coming back to this store again...""

Later I got the full story. She scanned the ticket correctly and the machine announced that she was a winner. A full screen graphic and giant words, the works. She freaked out at the prospect of becoming billionaires (she does not know how much is shaved off for taxes, but that's a different story..), attracting attention in the store. After hyperventilating for a minute or two, she saw that the machine stated to proceed to a checkout counter, she walks over and......found out that she won $2.

She was not aware that if you get one number (or some) in the right place you can win your money back. Anyways after landing back on earth abruptly she left the store mortified at her reaction to winning $2 and now we need to find somewhere else to shop lol

 TL;DR Wife did not know that you can win tiny amounts of money for getting one number correct in the lotto, mistakenly thought we became billionaires, based on her reaction in the store she now needs to find a new store to shop at :)

This literally just happened, I can't tell anyone in real life so i have to share this somewhere.

So it's a standard Saturday night, few drinks hanging out with my boyfriend and decided to move things on. We get to having sex and moved on to anal without preparing. It's a fantasy of his that I lick his dick afterwards, which I don't have issue with, and have done before when we're in the mood (and drunk). 

So I gave it one long lick when done, and could feel something like a hair in my mouth. Pulled it out with my finger, turns out it was a worm. A fucking WORM! 

Probably worth mentioning that I work with kids so this is a thing i have to deal with semi regularly (kids get worms all the time). 

This is the grossest thing that's ever happened to me and we just discovered the biggest mood killer that can exist. Now just sat here both of us grossing out.

TL:DR had anal with my boyfriend, licked him after and got a parasitic worm in my mouth."

For a year, our shared kitchen and fridge functioned harmoniously, with everyone respecting one another's food. However, an anonymous individual began stealing my sandwiches, consuming half of each one, leaving bite marks, as if to taunt me.

Initially, I assumed it was a one-off incident, but when it occurred again, I was determined to act. I prepared sandwiches with an extremely spicy Carolina Reaper sauce ( a tea spoon in each), leaving a note warning about the consequences of stealing someone else's food, and went out for lunch. Upon my return, chaos reigned. The atmosphere was one of panic, and a woman's scream cut through the commotion, accompanied by a child's cry.

The culprit turned out to be our cleaner's 9-year-old son, who she had been bringing to work during his school's disinfection week. He had made a habit of pilfering from the fridge, bypassing the healthy lunches his mother had prepared, in favor of my sandwiches. The child was in distress, suffering from the intense spiciness of the sauce. In my defense, I explained that the sandwiches were mine and I'd spiked them with hot sauce.

The cleaner, initially relieved by my explanation, suddenly became furious, accusing me of trying to harm her child. This resulted in an escalated situation, with the cleaner reporting the incident to our landlord and threatening police intervention. The incident strained relations within the other workshops, siding with the cleaner due to her status as a mother. Consequently, our landlord has given us a month to relocate, adding to our financial struggles.

My friends, too, are upset with me. I maintain my innocence, arguing that I had no idea a child was the food thief, and I would never intentionally harm a child. Nevertheless, it seems I am held responsible, accused of creating a huge problem from a seemingly trivial situation.

The child is ok. No harm to the health was inflicted. It still was just an edible sauce, just very very spicy.

TLDR: Accidentally fed a little boy an an insanely spicy sandwich."

She works at a very large and popular wholesale store that has hotdogs. She told me beforehand that I could come see her at work any time and there would be no trouble. 

I walked in the front door and walked past the card-checker girl. She did a double-take and asked if I work there. I replied  “no, I do not. I am here to see an employee, however. I’m looking for ——— in ———.”

She sheepishly got her radio and said, “management to front entrance; non-emergency”

A manager with the largest tablet I’ve ever seen strapped to her arm walked up and I explained again why I was there. She called for my GF on the radio but she was not near her radio. I apparently kicked the hornet’s nest and I could hear chatter on other employee’s radios. 

“Who’s that guy here to see ———-?“

“Are we being audited? He looks important”

“GUYS, LOOK BUSY” 

I caught glances from just about every worker nearby and I could feel them trying to figure me out

It was at this time my GF got back to her radio and heard the commotion and stepped out of her office and made eye contact with me. She wrapped up her work and we went out to lunch finally. I asked her why there was such a ruckus. She said that I dress nicely and I’m very polite which are characteristics of a corporate rep who comes in to fire people. That’s when she also admitted to me that I sometimes have asshole resting face. I guess I need to smile more. 

TLDR: I surprised my GF at work and her coworkers thought I was there to perform an audit or fire somebody. "
15lqmde,TIFU by asking my partner to stop eating his own cum after sex,22728,0.81,5885,2023-08-09 00:15:03,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15lqmde/tifu_by_asking_my_partner_to_stop_eating_his_own/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15lqmde/tifu_by_asking_my_partner_to_stop_eating_his_own/,self.tifu,0,19,,text,True,False,False,"I (F23)'ve been in a relationship with this guy (M33) for like a year. When we started dating, after a month of getting to know each other we went to his place and did the deed. Enjoyable experience overall. BUT, after he was done, he removed the condom and...with very expert gestures, proceeded to drink his junk right out of it.  
I was shocked and confused. In my head I was like ""Yooo man, wtf????"". He was my first partner and like...I wondered if that was...kinda normal? Common? Idk???  
Since I used to be a people pleaser, I managed to hide my shock and disgust, and simply asked him: ""Why did you do that?""  
He answered me, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world: ""It's a lot of kiloJoules of energy, I can't waste them"".  
I was even more confused. I was literally speechless and what was being a very nice and romantical night managed to become a weird and kinda awkward situation.  
To make things worse, he even stated in a very dramatic tone: ""I will never allow anyone to eat my semen"". He said that like his junk was something precious...like...if someone would ever get access to that...it was like, being able to steal his soul??? Idk. It made no sense. And also, dude, nobody here is trying to steal ur precious cum, ugh.

Btw, he wasn't drinking his cum in a kinky or erotic way or idk, he did it like it was an extremely serious and important deal. Why drinking ur own cum must be so dramatic???  
We kept dating for several months and everytime we had sex, every. single. time. he did the same thing.  
I started to become very concerned, since usually inside the condoms there's usually some lube...I guess? He even complaint about the bad taste of the lube or the latex the condom was made of (the taste of his own cum somehow didn't bother him at all, good for him). And even if usually lube is not that toxic, I think that consuming a small amount but very often may not be the healthiest habit. Also his breath right after this ""ritual"" almost made me throw up all the times, since he even refused to brush his teeth afterwards. ""I didn't chew, I swallowed it in one gulp, so I don't need to brush my teeth"". Ew.

I tried to discretely make him understand that his habit was grossing me out, by saying out loud ""EW"" or by covering my eyes, but he didn't got the clues.

A year passed by. I had enough. I tried to confront him, but nope. He was unmovable. Neither the fact that his passion for his own cum was making me a little uncomfortable, nor the fact that imo eating lube could be harmful made him stop.  
He then proceeded to get mad. He stated that he wasn't doing anything wrong, that he just didn't want to waste ""precious substances from his body"" and that I was making a scene for nothing. I told him about his breath and he straight up accused ME of having a bad smell??? I told him that by deflecting my accuse he was just making things worse, but then he interrupted me and just told me I was insufferable. Then he just left.

He was extremely angry, I've never seen that side of him. I'm sure that he will tell me to pack my things and to leave.

So rn I'm mad, confused AND scared about his behavior. 



TL;DR: after the first time me and my partner had sex he drank his own cum directly from the condom. I was disgusted and after a year I asked him to stop. He got mad and I think he's about to leave me. 


EDIT:
OMG. Well, I was right about being freaked out by his behavior having read most of the comments... Anyway pleeeease no judging about the fact that I've stayed with him for over a year (I'm really ashamed about it), the situation was very complex for me. But to cut it short, let's say that I have very low standards and not a lot of self-esteem :^("

Today was the third day and we were returning to our room. My boyfriend goes to takes his wallet out of his pocket to get the hotel keycard and a small, black, square packet that looks exactly like a condom falls out. My heart immediately sinks because my boyfriend and I have never used condoms so this clearly isn't meant for us.

My boyfriend immediately grabs it and shoves it in his pocket then continues to open the door, obviously hoping I didn't notice what just fell out. I ask him what that was and his face immediately gets bright red and he starts acting extremely nervous which I've never seen him do before. At this point I am so flustered and angry that I just leave the room while I hear him calling my name behind me. I went down to the pool for a few hours ignoring his phone calls and idk what I'm gonna do. I spend all day just trying to distract myself with random things to do around Vegas.

When I get back to the hotel he tells me he's sorry but the doesn't understand why I was so angry over it. I tell him of course I'm angry about it cause clearly that condom wasn't for us so wtf was he gonna use it for. When I said this he gets a puzzled looks then immediately goes to his suitcase and grabs a bunch of these tiny black packages like the one I saw fall out of his pocket.

I take one and look at it. They are individually packaged butt wipes, not condoms. He said he's been having really bad diarrhea the last couple days and snuck off to buy these at one of the convenience stores in the hotel, but got really embarrassed in the moment when it fell out. I ignored him for a whole day on our vacation cause he wanted a clean butt. I apologized and it ended up being hilarious to us

TLDR: ignored my boyfriend for a day cause I thought a condom fell out of his pocket, it was an individually packaged butt wipe for his diarrhea"

His response to this pic was not what I was expecting. He completely broke down and for almost an hour he just cried and wailed, “I don’t want you to get old and die mama! Please don’t get old and die mama!” He repeated it over and over, as if him saying it would somehow will me into existence forever. Nothing I could do or say could comfort him. He did this until he passed out.  (It was bedtime) I think for the first time he realized that I would die, and what that actually means. Did I traumatize my baby?

I work with over a dozen different surgeons. The one Dr is one of the OGs at this place, been around forever, seen it all, done it all, nothing really bothers him. He's very quiet and reserved during surgery. I'm new here, so I'm really trying to make a good impression.

The case before I worked with this doctor was literally the smoothest case I've ever assisted. I was truly a step ahead the entire case, and the surgeon didn't have to ask me to do anything, because I was already doing it. It felt so great! So, when I saw my assignment was to work with him, I was super pumped to get a chance to build on how great the previous case went.

So, there were are, in the middle of the surgery. The heart is arrested is diastole, the heart-lung machine is cycling the blood instead, and we have the heart literally cut open to replace a valve. Right in the middle of placing the valve sutures into the heart, he handed me 2 of them, and I went to place a hemostat clamp on them outside of the open chest, like I had with the rest of them. This is a routine and imprecise move, so I was kind of nonchalant about it. Unfortunately the surgeon pulled his hand back right as I went to clamp, and I clamped a motherfucking metal clamp onto his pinkie knuckle. He lurched back, and screamed in pain, looked at me and said, ""NOW WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!?""

I was speechless, being caught totally off guard. Obviously I hadn't done it on purpose. This reserved and quiet surgeon did a just-scored-a-TD-in-the-SuperBowl spike with the now contaminated-with-his-own-blood needle driver he had been holding onto the floor, ripped off his gown and gloves, and stormed out of the room.

The entire room was pindrop quiet. What do we do with this open chest and open heart without a surgeon? What happens now? My career flashed before my eyes. My ears burned like lit sparklers, and sweat started running down my neck. My surgical goggles started fogging up. For a second I felt likei was going to pass out. But 30 seconds later we heard the surgeon slamming the metal panel on the scrub sink, and we knew he was scrubbing back in. 

He came back in the room a few minutes later, clearly red hot mad, but we went right back to work and finished the case without a single word about what happened. When he was getting ready to leave the room, I apologized sincerely, which he kind of resentfully accepted.

TL;DR: I ripped a world class heart surgeon's hand open with a metal clamp in the middle of surgery, which REALLY pissed him off, but he washed the blood off and went right back to work like the professional that he is, and I almost died from shame.

Edit: marked NSFW due to the fucking ""F word"" and because apparently I'm literally NSFW

Edit for clarification: don't mistake my comment about being nonchalant as being careless. The point was that I wasn't in the chest, I was back off to the side just clipping sutures together, so it's a different kind of movement then handling tissues inside the chest. My mistake was in having tunnel vision and not seeing the unexpected movement of the surgeon, not in how I was clipping the sutures together

One final edit: HOLT SHIT. I scrub out from a heart transplant today to find that I've hit the front page. So I wanted to add a couple more details. The surgeon was fine, just had the side of his knuckle pinched in there tips of a hemostat hard enough to tear the skin a little. I love my job so much, and am pretty good at it. We've worked together since and it never even came up, because he trusts my skillset. Also, if you have any questions about heart surgery, feel free to ask. We do some awesome gnarly shit."

But the story actually starts about 18 years before that, when I was a baby.

Like most kids, I hated getting soap in my eyes in the bath.  Even the gentle “baby shampoo” would send me into a rage.  My dad, being the intrepid problem solving sort with a penchant for over engineering, came up with a sort of 360 degree visor that my hair would stick through.  Then, they could wash my hair and the soapy water would just roll off.  It was great.  It kind of looked like a flower on my head, so my parents would say I was “flowering while showering.”

Eventually, the OG visor got mildew and was disposed of, but my dad made a few over the years.  He ultimately stopped when he decided that I should be able to wash my hair without getting soap in my eyes, but I wasn’t having it and started making my own.  Over time, “flower hats” for this exact purpose became mass produced and I switched over to just buying them as needed.  Never got soap in my eyes!  It was great!

Well, by the time I was 20 and living in my own apartment in college, I still hadn’t kicked the ol’ flower hat.  I was flowering while showering every day, living my best life.  Cue a cute girl staying at my place and suggesting we take a shower together before fucking.  She asked me to wash her hair and brush conditioner through it, which apparently felt really good to her and was a major turn on.  When I was done, she offered to wash my hair.  I didn’t think that would do anything for me, but I said “sure!”

I then reached out of the shower for the drawer where I kept my flower hat and put it on.  At first she laughed and thought I was joking, even after I explained what it was.  But then I think she noticed how it looked kind of old and used and faded, and that it would be strangely elaborate to keep a flower hat in my bathroom for the occasional joke.

To her credit, she washed my hair while I wore it.  We didn’t end up having sex that night—I can’t remember her explanation—but after she left the next morning she didn’t return my calls or AIM messages.  

I didn’t stop flowering while showering immediately after that.  I would just say, “oh, I washed my hair already” if the situation came up again.  But when I met my now-wife, I knew it was time to give it up.  So I no longer flower while
I shower, I just live with the occasional pain of getting soap in my eyes.

But you better believe that when we had kids, I immediately got them flower hats.  My wife thinks they’re brilliant.  She has no idea of my dark past.  And every once in a while I look at my kids’ flower hats, and I hear them calling to me, beckoning me to don them.  I haven’t succumbed yet, but I think it’s only a matter of time…

TL;DR:  Flowered while I showered; got a good hair wash but nothing else.

I hate jeans. I *hate* jeans. I will wear them as necessary to not look like a scrub but I’d honestly rather wear slacks or khakis as needed. My preferred bottoms are basketball shorts or sweatpants, and I can and do wear them almost all the time. 

When I changed location at work about 6-7 years ago, I moved to a position that requires long pants, and I obviously chose sweats because I may as well be somewhat comfortable at work. 

What I failed to understand is that the sweatpants are what Ron Burgundy would describe as “flattering in the crotchal region”. This is not a brag-I am average in that department. I’m also a grower, not a shower. I know it seems ridiculous, but I was not aware of this function my pants were providing. I just don’t really think about my penis that much. I also don’t expect anyone to be taking a good long look. Call me naive I guess. 

A couple weeks ago, I was informed by a female coworker that she was warned about where she looked on a job-by a male coworker-as I was “slinging penis” which is a term I’d never heard and baffled me. My bulge is/was very prominent. My surprise led me to asking others if this was actually the case, since that’s not exactly the vibe I’m looking to put out at work. I’m happily married and not looking. I was further informed that indeed many people **had** noticed and commented, though obviously not to me, that I was really putting myself out there-as the saying goes. To make matters more complicated? Worse? I had switched to first shift several years ago and the people had also discussed the subject at length. The result was that I must be going without underwear(not true). 

TL;DR I’ve been living the “dicks out for Harambe” life for years/my coworkers are a bunch of meat gazers. 

The Aftereffects: wife and I talk about it. I show her the goods, she kinda shrugs but laughs at the situation. I leave before she’s awake and change out of work clothes first thing on getting home. But of course that can’t be the end of it. 

Just a few days later we get pizza with her family. Her aunt lost part of her jaw to cancer years back and has a tough time chewing. I am kinda known in the pizza shop because wife and I like their breadsticks. Wife likes hers doughy and because they know my name and face, they always do a great job. One of the women referred to me as her best customer a week prior to the revelations. 

I order and return with pizza and breadsticks, which are uncharacteristically, for in laws, made better than usual. Mother in law says “maybe (me) should get our pizza all the time!” Which causes my wife to laugh, give me a look and ask “have you been wearing your sweatpants in there too?” Causing confusion for the in laws. 

So I sigh and explain to her fairly conservative parents and cackling aunt what I recently learned, prompting her mother, bless her heart, asks, “did she say slinging or swinging?”"
15vf9oy,TIFU when I (18m) asked my parents for permission to have sex in my room,18970,0.91,1543,2023-08-19 18:11:34,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15vf9oy/tifu_when_i_18m_asked_my_parents_for_permission/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/15vf9oy/tifu_when_i_18m_asked_my_parents_for_permission/,self.tifu,0,5,,text,True,False,False,"A couple of months ago I asked my parents if I was allowed to have sex in my room. My gf and I usually had sex in the woods, but it became too uncomfortable and unsafe, so I decided to embrace the embarrassment of asking my mom and dad for permission to sleep with my gf in my bed. I never wanted to have that conversation with my parents, but I wanted to show them that I was mature enough to talk to them instead of sneaking my gf in and out of my room when no one was watching. Cue the awkward ""can I have sex in my room"" conversation. My mom struggled to accept the fact that I was sexually active and got upset at me for expecting her to allow me to have sex under her roof. In other words, the answer was no. I was 17 at the time. 

My mom completely lost her mind after that conversation and decided to start ""hiking"" all of a sudden, which was an obvious excuse to patrol the woods where my gf and I had sex. She even managed to convince other like-minded moms to ""hike"" with her because my gf and I were not the only teenagers hooking up in the woods. I called them The Neighbor Wood Watch. My gf and I were forced to go deeper into the woods to lower the risk of not only being caught by real hikers but also by mother hikers aka the NWW. I was confidently leading the way to our new sex spot until I realized I had no idea where we were anymore. I was low key experiencing post nut clarity but without the nut. There were no signs or trails anywhere. My gf and I spent most of the afternoon retracing our steps instead of having sex. 

I don't know how long we were lost, but it was beginning to get dark when we made it out of the woods. My gf was not happy with me at all. She made it clear that she was done fucking in the woods forever. My mom successfully made the woods fuck proof and cock-blocked me. Not much has changed since I turned 18. I'm still living at home with the leader of the NWW. My gf and I are not having as much sex as we used to because the woods are off limits and we're too poor to pay for privacy. For the record, if you're in my position due to the increase in moms in the woods, I'm sorry. 

TL:DR I asked my parents if I could have sex in my room instead of in the woods. My mom said no and made it her mission in life to prevent me from having sex anywhere."
1bt5k6j,"TIFU by yelling into my Teams meeting ""Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!"" - I was not on mute.",18833,0.95,1045,2024-04-01 20:14:21,tifu,18612778,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1bt5k6j/tifu_by_yelling_into_my_teams_meeting_jesus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1bt5k6j/tifu_by_yelling_into_my_teams_meeting_jesus/,self.tifu,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Title covers it, thought I was on mute and was not. Someone was messaging me on the side asking if I could meet at certain times (my very limited free time is on my calendar). I yell in pure frustration ""Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!"" The meeting got really quiet and I realized what happened. Just gave a little sheepish ""my bad, thought I was muted"" and went silent. The person I was yelling about messaged me on the side and apologized, which made me feel even worse.

I apologized, and said it was very unprofessional. I tried to explain how I am really stressed with deadlines (I am) and was venting but I still feel like a total ass, which is accurate. This was a smaller group of decent people so I don't think anyone will complain to my boss or anything like that, I just get to live with my embarrassing FU.

TL;DR: Yelled at/about people in an online meeting thinking I was muted.

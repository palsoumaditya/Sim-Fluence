Edit II: the point I'm trying to make is that in both cases it is wrong to encourage unhealthy behaviors under the guise of support or because you enjoy the effects of the dangerous behaviors. 

Not only that, but you're basically saying they aren't fun unless they drink and they aren't beautiful unless they're overweight.  You're completely disregarding their health and quality of life. Body positivity should mean you're beautiful no matter what size and we shouldn't equate ANY weight with beauty. Weight should be about health only. 

You also shouldn't be a jerk to someone because of their weight. "

I've been a huge fan of Bill Bye since I was ten. Bill Nye the Science Guy was entertaining and educational. Bill Nye Saves the World is neither. In this show he simply brings up an issue, tells you which side you should be on, and then makes fun of people on the other side. To make things worse he does this in the most boring way possible in front of crowd that honestly seems retarded. He doesn't properly explain anything, and he misrepresents every opposing view.

I just finished watching the fad diet episode. He presents Paleo as ""only eating meat"" which is not even close to what Paleo is. Paleo is about eating nutrient rich food, and avoiding processed food, grains and sugar. It is protein heavy, but is definitely not all protein. He laughs that cavemen died young, but forgets to mention that they had very low markers of cardiovascular disease.

In the first episode he shuts down nuclear power simply because ""nobody wants it."" Really? That's his go to argument? There was no discussion about handling nuclear waste, or the nuclear disaster in Japan. A panelist states that the main problem with nuclear energy is the long time it takes to build a nuclear plant (because of all the red tape). So we have a major issue (climate change caused by burning hydrocarbons), and a potential solution (nuclear energy), but we are going to dismiss it because people don't want it and because of the policies in place by our government. Meanwhile, any problems with clean energy are simply challenges that need to be addressed, and we need to change policy to help support clean energy and we need to change public opinion on it.

In the alternative medicine episode he dismisses a vinegar based alternative medicine because it doesn't reduce the acidity level of a solution. He dismiss the fact that vinegar has been used to treat upset stomach for a long time. How does vinegar treat an upset stomach? Does it actually work, or is it a placebo affect? Does it work in some cases, and not in others? If it does anything, does it just treat a symptom, or does it fix the root cause? I don't know the answer to any of these questions because he just dismissed it as wrong and only showed me that it doesn't change the pH level of an acidic solution. Also, there are many foods that are believed to help prevent diseases like fish (for heart health), high fiber breads (for colon cancer), and citrus fruits (for scurvy). A healthy diet and exercise will help prevent cardiovascular disease, and will help reduce your blood pressure among other benefits. So obviously there is some reasoning behind some alternative medicine and practices and to dismiss it all as a whole is stupid.

I just don't see the point of this show. It's just a big circle jerk. It's not going to convince anyone that they're wrong, and it's definitely not going to entertain anyone. It's basically just a very poor copy of Penn and Teller's BS! show, just with all intelligent thought removed."

Quote:

""After posting his apology, ""HanA**holeSolo"" called CNN's KFile and confirmed his identity. In the interview, ""HanA**holeSolo"" sounded nervous about his identity being revealed and asked to not be named out of fear for his personal safety and for the public embarrassment it would bring to him and his family.

CNN is not publishing ""HanA**holeSolo's"" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.

CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.""

There's no longer an opportunity to decompress or think about what you just watched unless you remember to actually click on the credits to bring it back to full screen. And as far as I've seen, there's no setting anywhere to change this.

It's the most obnoxious user interface change they've made. At least you can mute the autoplaying trailers on the home screen and it remembers your preference. But there's no getting around cutting off the credits to movies unless you deliberately take action to click on the minimized picture. Screw you, Netflix."

***

15 years ago today, Cartoon Network gave three hours in the middle of the night to an experiment called Adult Swim.
 
For the last 10 years in a row, the network has ranked No. 1 among adults 18-34 years old in basic-cable ratings across the total day. The median age of the Adult Swim viewer is 24 years old, about half that of viewers across all broadcast and cable channels.
 
It saved Family Guy and is responsible for making Seth MacFarlane a TV powerhouse with three shows, three movies, a nine figure net worth, and a relationship with Emilia Clarke. (not a good thing to everyone)
 
It saved Futurama.
 
It turned Tim and Eric from two weirdos who were mailing unsolicited DVD’s to Bob Odenkirk to comedy superstars with a multimedia and multichannel entertainment kingdom with two movies and thirteen television shows, including Nathan for You, Comedy Bang! Bang!, Review, W/ Bob & David, and Check it Out! With Dr. Steve Brule, which stars an Academy Award nominated actor.
 
It boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P, who went on to form Run the Jewels.
 
It gave Brendon Small a platform to launch his multimedia Metalocalypse franchise of a show, albums, and even live tours.
 
It caused a terrorism scare that cost the head of Cartoon Network his job.

#####Let’s set the scene
 
It's September 2, 2001. The animated adult comedy landscape is nascent but sparsely populated, and you still (barely) live in an innocent, pre-9/11 world.
 
Mission Hill has been off the air for 1 year, Space Ghost and Dr. Katz for 2 years, and Beavis and Butt-Head and Duckman for 4 years.  (The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?) Home Movies only lasted five episodes before being canceled by UPN 2 years ago. The Simpsons is already arguably in decline with Oakley and Weinstein gone. Family Guy has been granted a last minute reprieve of a third season, but its likely to be canceled again as Fox continuously shifts its schedule, and would you really miss it anyway? King of the Hill is going strong, but that's kind of an acquired taste. Futurama is great, but like Family Guy, Fox is fucking with its schedule so you worry. And of course, there's South Park, but nobody wants to enjoy just 1 show forever.
 
The future seems bleak. South Park, the Simpsons, and Beavis and Butthead are popular. Why won’t anyone else give shows like these a serious chance?
 
You’ve heard rumors that Cartoon Network aired some really strange shows with no warning last year. You even caught a random new episode of Space Ghost over the summer! They’ve experimented with weird late night stuff before, like ToonHeads and Late Night Black and White, but even that was still mainly for kids and they canceled Space Ghost in ’99! The bastards.
 
You resign yourself to channel surfing when you hear [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9CnXYQMTUw). What does it mean? What could it be for? What the hell is “adult swim’? (LOWERCASE INTENDED). Curious, you keep watching, and you can’t believe it, it’s [Home Movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Movies_(TV_series))! And it’s… a new episode?!?! Enraptured, you keep watching. A show about [fast food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force)? A show about [Birdman as a lawyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Birdman,_Attorney_at_Law)? A show about [an underwater research station full of insane people]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealab_2021)? [Brak got his own damn show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brak_Show)! And even [Cowboy goddamn Bebop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop)! One of the greatest anime of all time!  What the hell is going on?!?!
 
#Beginnings
 
In 1993, Mike Lazzo was senior vice president of Cartoon Network, a subsidiary network of Turner that was just a year old and hoping to challenge its more established competitors, Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. The decline of cartoons on the networks due to FCC regulations and market shifts (see: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday-morning_cartoon#Decline
)) gave an upstart like Cartoon Network a chance.
 
Even back then at a children’s focused channel like Cartoon Network, however, it was obvious animation wasn’t just for adults, so Ted Turner asked Mike Lazzo, a high school dropout who’d worked his way up from Turner’s shipping department^[1], to create a cheap cartoon that would air late at night and appeal to adults.
 
“What, reasoned Lazzo, could be more low-cost than to take animation frames from the old Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning children's cartoon series Space Ghost and Dino Boy and superimpose them over newly filmed live action sequences? Going a bit farther, Lazzo decided to use the old reedited Space Ghost footage as part of a concept he'd been toying with for year: a satirical David Letterman-style talk show, with a thoroughly clueless and humorless host asking celebrity guests a steady stream of stupid, non sequitur questions. As a result, Space Ghost Coast to Coast was not only the Cartoon Network's first original cartoon series, but it was also the first animated talk show in TV history!”^[2]
 
“The original name of the show stemmed from early 1993, while Andy Merrill and Jay Edwards were coming up with names for a marathon of the original Space Ghost TV show to air on Cartoon Network, trying to find things that rhyme with ""Ghost"".”^[3]
 
Space Ghost got 6 seasons and even a kid friendly spin off (Cartoon Planet) before being canceled, or at least put on hiatus, in 1999.

#Kickoff
 
While entertaining pitches for a variety of adult-focused cartoons, Lazzo realized the potential for packaging them as a complete adult-focused block. Different names were considered, including “ibiso”, Spanish for “stop”, and “Parental Warning”, but he eventually settled on Adult Swim. Cartoon Network aired pilots for Harvey Birdman, Aqua Teen, Sealab, and Brak unannounced on different late night hours in December 2000, and aired two new episodes of Space Ghost in May and July 2001 to test the waters. After greenlighting the pilots, reviving Home Movies, and securing the rights to Cowboy Bebop, Adult Swim was born, starting off with the first new episode of Home Movies, “Director’s Cut”.
 
#Family Guy
 
Family Guy was created by Hanna-Barbera veteran Seth MacFarlane, who’d worked on several Cartoon Network shows developed by Lazzo, including Powerpuff Girls, Courage the Cowardly dog, and Dexter’s Lab, as an adaptation of his thesis film for his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design.The show struggled under Fox’s infamously fickle scheduling, which saddled it with low ratings. Adult Swim began reruns of the show in April 2003, and the show was canceled by Fox the same year. It immediately skyrocketed to Adult Swim’s highest rated show, with ratings 239% higher on the late night network than on Fox. The ratings success, coupled with strong DVD sales, convinced Fox to renew the show for a fourth season. Family Guy has since aired 14 total seasons and numerous specials. Show creator Seth MacFarlane used the success of the show to successfully negotiate for two additional shows on Fox, American Dad, which has aired 13 seasons and which airs in reruns on Adult Swim today, and The Cleveland Show, which aired for four seasons on Fox before being canceled and also still airs in reruns on Adult Swim today.

#Futurama

The brainchild of Simpsons creator and television icon Matt Groening and Simpsons writer David X. Cohen, Futurama also struggled with Fox’s capricious scheduling and only lasted one more season than Family Guy before being canceled. Adult Swim picked up the show for reruns in 2003, and producers used the high ratings to convince Fox to greenlight four direct-to-DVD movies. The success of those movies convinced Comedy Central to pick up the show for a revival and reruns. Futurama went on to air 52 additional episodes on Comedy Central.

#Tim and Eric

Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim met while studying at Temple University, and began producing comedy shorts shortly thereafter. In 2002, they mailed a packet containing glossy headshots, a letter, a DVD containing early versions of Tom Goes to the Mayor, and an itemized bill for all of the above to Conan O’Brien, Robert Smigel, and fortuitously, Bob Odenkirk. Bob was the only who responded.^[4] From that pitch, we got one of Adult Swim’s strangest shows and the beginning of perhaps the most controversial Adult Swim success stories. One look at Adult Swim’s social media presence will tell you that there is perhaps no bigger demarcator in the Adult Swim fan base than feelings on Tim and Eric. A switch from the dialogue driven animated “stoner” comedy of the early crop of shows to the live action surreal “cringe” humor of Tim and Eric, which relied heavily upon video editing, is still, in my opinion, the biggest cultural inflection point in Adult Swim’s history.

T&E leveraged the success of TGTTM to negotiate for their next show, the most controversial Adult Swim show ever, Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! which ran for 5 seasons. The show was followed by a Christmas special, a movie, a failed pilot with Gregg Turkington in his Neil Hamuburger, the Twilight Zone inspired anthology show Tim and Eric Bedtime Stories, and a direct spinoff, Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule, starring Academy Award nominated actor John C. Reilly, which just concluded its 4th season.

Tim and Eric are no longer just late night TV alt comedy stars, however. As their success on Adult Swim grew, so did their reach outside of the network. They’ve produced shows on IFC, Comedy Central, and Netflix, including the breakout hit Nathan for You, and the Netflix revival of their comedy mentor Bob Odenkirk’s show Mr. Show. Eric has built up a career as a major music video director, producing videos for Ben Folds, Beach House, Major Lazer, and more. Tim has established himself as a (semi-serious) musician, and acted in mainstream hits like the hit film Bridesmaids, The Simpsons, the Office, and more. Together with Sarah Silverman, Reggie Watts, and Michael Cera, Tim and Eric created the popular YouTube comedy channel Jash.

The Abso Lutely train shows no signs of slowing down any time soon, and the divisive reactions it incites among Adult Swim fans show no signs of abating.

#Metalocalypse

Brendon Small was no stranger to Adult Swim. They’d been a savior to him when they’d saved Home Movies from UPN obscurity and cancellation, but the show ended in 2004. During this time, he began attending metal shows with his friend Tommy Blacha, former writer for Conan, SNL’s TV Funhouse, and Da Ali G Show, and the former creative director for the WWE. From these shows, the idea for Metalocalypse, originally titled Deathclock, was born. Small, a guitar geek and graduate of the Berklee College of Music, worked to ensure that the show was as faithful to real guitar playing as it was funny, carefully syncing the animation of realistic finger and hand movements to the show’s music. Almost every episode featured an original metal song, and the list of guest stars soon became a Who’s Who of the metal and rock worlds.

Dethklok wasn’t just a fictional band, however. Small and Adult Swim released three full length albums and an EP as Dethklok, and even conducted full nationwide tours in “Gorillaz style” several times, with video depictions of the animated band and a real band on stage, featuring Small and others.

But all good things must come to an end. In it’s third season Metalocalypse became the first of only two Adult Swim shows ever to increase its running time from one season to the next (the other was China, IL) going from the more Adult Swim traditional time of 11 minutes up to 22. This did not last, though, and for the show’s fourth season its running time was brought back down to 11 minutes. In what proved to be another one of the network’s most controversial decisions ever, the fourth season would come to be the last, as Adult Swim canceled the series. Contentious negotiations followed (Small told one interviewer that he hung up on Lazzo in fury the last time they ever spoke by phone), but the show ultimately concluded its broadcast history with an hour length rock opera titled The Doomstar Requiem.

***TRILL-I-AM’S CONJECTURE***

Mike Lazzo is famously hands on with Adult Swim creators, to the point of driving the development of individual characters.

“He suggested that 14-year-old Morty should show more backbone, because that’s the character whose perspective the audience gets most.
The producers took his advice and added a new scene to the first episode in which the grandson seizes control of a space ship from a drunken Rick to prevent a catastrophic explosion. “That’s how we found [the characters’] relationship,” says Mr. Harmon. “You don’t want to let Lazzo down. Which, as a writer, is such a crazy thing to hear yourself say about a suit.””

So basically, if you have a show on Adult Swim, you’re not insulated from the bigwigs by layers of bureaucracy. There’s just one bigwig and he’s directly involved with the creative process of almost every show. So if you have a show, he better like it.

Fans will tell you that Mike Lazzo doesn’t appreciate good art and that his cancellation of Metaltocalypse makes him worse than Hitler. I think this misses the point of why he canceled it.
From bits and pieces of interviews and one-off appearances on Adult Swim streaming shows, I’ve basically put together that Mike Lazzo thought the show had forgotten that Adult Swim was a comedy network, and its increasing emphasis on telling a serialized serious story involving prophecies and talking whales instead of telling jokes with music on the side meant the show was no longer suited for Adult Swim. The only other Adult Swim show that’s ever attempted to tell a semi-serious serialized story, The Venture Bros., has dealt with the balance between story and comedy by staying light-hearted throughout and grounding the serious elements in a world and web of characters that’s constantly being lampshaded and being put in your face as inherently less than serious. The Boondocks would make serious points (Return of the King and The Passion of Reverend Ruckus) but was balanced out by many more comedic episodes.

Do you think serious storytelling has a place on Adult Swim? If your answer is yes, then you probably think Lazzo was wrong to cancel Metalocalypse. If your answer is no, it would seem that Lazzo made the right decision.

#Anime

In the 90s, Toonami used hits like Dragonball Z to pave the way the normalization of anime on 
American children’s television. Adult Swim followed it up with the first full-throated introduction of mature action anime to American audiences. With shows like Cowboy Bebop, The Big O, and Samurai Champloo, Adult Swim blew the doors off of anime in America, exposing audiences to an entire catalog of shows that no other network would have been willing to broadcast. Even Toonami could never have aired a show Trinity Blood. Breaking even more new ground, Adult Swim has even helped finance original Western-friendly anime like Space Dandy and the upcoming second season FLCL. While anime on the network is currently limited to only one day a week, it’s still a testament to Adult Swim’s relative bravery in the world of television that they’re willing to air a category of shows that almost no other other American television network has been willing to air in the 15 years since AS started, except for flirtations by G4 and SyFy.

#Streaming

Adult Swim currently has 10 different 24/7 streaming channels, only two of which require a cable or satellite subscription. They have a daily animation marathon, a daily live action marathon, a marathon of Tim and Eric, a marathon of The Venture Bros., a stream of their growing companion online channel of shows like FishCenter and Stupid Morning Bullshit, a marathon of the experimental video/music show Off the Air, a Toonami marathon, a marathon replay of the online show FishCenter Live, and an east and west coast live simulcast of the television block that requires cable or satellite. While their deal with Hulu took a great amount of content off AdultSwim.com, the amount of episodes they offer on their website for free and with unimpeded access is still completely unparalleled in the American television landscape.

#infomercials/Off the Air

Adult Swim is more friendly to experimental video and comedy than any other television brand or network in American history. No other network would be willing to air a show like Off the Air (albeit at 4 AM). And while hits like Too Many Cooks may briefly capture the internet’s attention, it’s just the tip of the iceberg of Adult Swim’s insane and daring series of shorts known as Infomercials. There’s [“M.O.P.Z.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7RyZDMRQTI) a full feature length film sped up until its only 11 minutes long. There’s the disturbing [“This House Has People In It”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7RyZDMRQTI) from internet famous experimental fillmmaker Alan Resnick, complete with its own still yet to be fully resolved ARG. There’s the (literally) sedate [“Joe Pera Talks You To Sleep”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trfHP5LHVNY).

# CONCLUSION

I could go on and on and on. If i’d started this earlier, I would’ve gone into Xavier Renegade Angel, Moral Orel, The Boondocks, and so much more.

Suffice it to say, Adult Swim has changed American television and American culture. While it may not have the flashy success of the more “grown-up” networks like HBO, FX, and Comedy Central, it’s a sleeping giant that those very same networks are falling all over each other to learn from.  The only other TV network to ever have a strong cultural brand identity, MTV, was already arguably in decline at this point in its life. Adult Swim is still going strong as hell, and I hope it’ll still be here in another 15 years. I’ve given it a lot of nights in my life, and like a body pillow, it’s been there for me.

There's a constant anxiety that something on my list will disappear before I get a chance to watch it. Give me more info so I can prioritize better. Display a ""subject to change"" disclaimer. If you're concerned that viewers will put off a show if the expiration date is far away, at least give us a warning six months in advance. Bury the info in the details - as long as I can get to it, I don't care.

EDIT: Oh geez. Front page. FYI - when I said ""constant anxiety,"" it was a bit of an overstatement. :) The fact is, when I'm deciding which show to watch, I have have to wonder how long these shows will be around. I understand licensing issues are complex, and Netflix has its reasons. Definitely a first-world problem, but they're so good at customer service, I wonder if they could improve a bit here. Even two months notice instead of one would be a huge improvement."

Who is the audience for this thing?

I was hoping for a science show meant for adults - the audience they had constantly laughing and making sounds looked like adults... but the content of the show was something you'd expect from a grade 6 science class.

The show just felt all over the place, using stupid skits, forced audience reactions and the most basic science concepts.

Does it get better? I'm not sure who is able to enjoy this, but I hope someone somewhere actually learns something from the show. It's definitely not the show I had hoped for."

Cas Anvar, who plays the show's pilot and has been active in communicating with fans, streamed a video discussing talks he had with SyFy yesterday. 

According to SyFy and Cas, they are willing to ""discuss"" The Expanse again if our Nielsen ratings go up for the rest of this season. Most simply, this means more people watching live, DVR'ing, and watching within 3 days of the broadcast. 

Here are the best ways to support the effort, in order of direct effectiveness. (I made a graphic for sharing **[here](https://imgur.com/gallery/vmUPFth))**

1. **Watch live** on cable, Sling, Hulu TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV Now, PS Vue, etc. Even if you’re not at home, leave your TV on SYFY! 

2. **DVR it** Watch it in the first 3 days in order to have impact - don’t just save it for later! Even better, watch live and DVR it, this counts twice! 

3. **Watch the next day** using paid services like Amazon Prime, iTunes, etc. 

4. **Keep your voice heard on social media!** Even if you can’t watch The Expanse as it’s being aired, keep showing your enthusiasm and introducing your friends to the show.

SYFY works with the Nielsen Ratings System to determine the show’s impact. Live views count the most, followed by views within 3 days. If in doubt, research to see if your watch method is counted by Nielsen. 

#Remember to watch WEDNESDAY NIGHTS, with hashtags #WatchExpanseLive and #SaveTheExpanse! The show goes live at 21:00 Eastern Time / 01:00 UTC. 

Thanks so much, everyone! We hope to see you around /r/TheExpanse sometime soon. 

###Again, [here's](https://imgur.com/gallery/vmUPFth) the image with this information. 

*Edit: I've been feeling a little bit off over the past few hours, and I now realize why (and it's not just because I'm mildly terrified to be posting on a sub this big, even though I am). It's important for me to know that I will willingly post like this and be accused of being a Russian bot or a covert SyFy marketer any day of the week, for the members of the welcoming, kind Expanse fan community that asked me to. And I will absolutely do it for the people I'm honored to call friends that are involved in the making of the show - they work so hard to create something beautiful while being a community themselves. I want them to keep getting to do that, no matter how that gets accomplished. I didn't, and wouldn't, post because I thought the only impact it could have is getting a renewal from SyFy.*"

Bob Ross was not just a TV painter. Beyond extending the joy of painting to millions who might otherwise have never thought themselves capable, Bob taught us to believe in ourselves, in the amazing power hidden in each and every soul. He understood the value of different perspectives, and encouraged all of his viewers to embrace their own unique humanity. He recognized the importance of both tragedy and beauty in the context of life as well as nature. 

Beyond all this, Bob Ross was one of the kindest, gentlest spirits to ever grace our TV screens. For as long as he could, he worked to make this world a prettier place, one painting at a time. For that, I will always look up to him.

Happy painting, Bob, and God bless.

There were documentaries on a ton of different topics: Modern Marvels, How it's Made, The Universe and all other kinds of great programming that were interesting and educational. But for the last 10 years or so, almost all their programming has been shows like Pawn Stars and American Pickers. They're shows that have a shred of historical relevance but focus primarily on just being entertaining

Today, they've changed up their programming a bit though. They're showing documentaries on the histories of different drugs. I've watched a bit of them and they seem decent but definitely historically-relevant so far. I feel though, since we as Redditors always complain that the History Channel doesn't show anything historical anymore, people should tune in to show them there's support (and ad revenue) to be made from this type of of programming!

Edit:spelling. I didn't expect this to get much traction. Also, I'm not on A&E's payroll (the parent company of the History Channel). "

You've somehow managed to align everyone's schedules and the whole group has shown up. Maybe even a few friends, SOs or ""retired"" players drop in and join the party.  

So the GM pulls out their big adventure, the one they've been working on for a while, and you go to it. Everyone's having a great time exploring the world and role playing. Sure, there's plenty of hack and slash, but you also enjoy the slow bits. You flirt with the ladies in the brothel. An interesting character tells you the back story of his cool sword. 

Then, as the hour draws late, you realize that you're running out of time. The GM's mom (or wife) is giving you the stink eye because she wants you all out so she can go to bed. People start talking about how they have to work in the morning. Snack supplies are getting perilously low.

So you speed things up so you can get to the end of the adventure. Everything happens very quickly. You flit around from one place to another. Conversations are short and to the point.

exkrij,You know what ruins the mood after a really emotionally charged ending to an episode or series?

Without spoiling anything, it gets emotional, as you should expect from that show. The ending, specifically the final moments, are designed in such a way to leave the viewer sitting in silence and ruminating on the events and the message, while a great song plays, leading you into the credits. You're supposed to just let it all wash over you, and come down from the experience of the finale and the show as a whole. It's beautiful and poignant, we were tearing up for fucks sake.

Except the *second* it cuts to black, here's [Netflix with some new series it feels it needs to force-feed me and that God damn countdown begins to stop the autoplaying](https://i.imgur.com/mZhIrME.jpg)

You know what a fucking countdown does when your just trying to come down from the emotions of a show? It upends them with panic as you scramble to find the damn remote or controller top stop the autoplaying. Often times your PS4 controller has gone to sleep and you need to reconnect it first, or you just can't find the remote in time, or you accidentally back out of the episode all together instead of hitting the Watch Credits option which they make it absurdly easy to do.

It's aggravating, it's anxiety inducing, and it is absolutely and unequivocally *unnecessary*. I've never had an experience where the ending to a show has had the mood so utterly spoiled by this shit as it was here. My boyfriend and I should have been sitting there coming down from an amazing experience, instead we were angry and annoyed because Netflix can't wait 60 fucking seconds before forcing some new show on us.

Netflix: let the fucking credits play!!"

They have 30 years of absolute nonsense to dish out. Ditch everything and go back to music videos and ridiculous music specials. They would have the highest viewed channel because people are bored out of their minds at home and it would be such a throwback. Between old and new content they would never even have to repeat a thing. It would be wild.

Edit:

The comments on this are hilarious. A couple things, yeah YouTube exists but YouTube blows. I loved YouTube back in the day and I still use it but man the ads everywhere, even with adblockers, is fucking lame. And I'm not paying for their premium. You used to be able to go on YouTube and discover new music easily, but the amount of looping the content you've previously seen is almost unavoidable and pathetic.  

I also feel that a lot of people don't remember what its like to discover new music on a constant shuffle without repeats. Sometimes you catch something you like, sometimes you don't, but when you're on YouTube or Vevo or even Spotify (anything) these days, unless you clear your history and cookies it will loop you through stuff you've heard and stuff you hate even with you being on top of it, or you get ads. YouTube used to be great for shuffling new music, and MTV too. Both sold out and advert the highest payers. Which is the way of things. 

My point was just that there was a lot of amazing content on MTV, and they used to blend various shows, and new constantly updated music, as well as classics, and music news, surprisingly well.

The discussions on here are fantastic. Even if people don't agree with me. I understand why. I'm not talking about a permanent thing. Just something that'd be cool while everyone's stuck at home. Don't get me wrong, I love Ridiculousness with a passion, it's like my favorite show these days, but goddamned revamped Jersey Shore and random Twilight in the afternoon every week is like WTF. Can't get much worse than that can it? Lmfao, reddit is beautiful. Stay safe y'all."

Set in a fantasy world filled with mythical creatures, hybrid animals, spirits, and where some people have the ability to bend the elements (Water, Earth, Fire, Air) and where one person- the Avatar- has the ability to bend all four elements and works to keep balance in the world. When the show begins the Avatar has been missing for 100 years and the Fire Nation has spent that century waging war against the other nations: conquering and colonizing much of The Earth Kingdom, capturing waterbenders, and committing genocide against the Air Nomads. The series follows Aang, the 12 year old avatar that was frozen in ice shortly the war began and is only the survivor of the Air Nomad genocide- The Last Airbender. Alongside Katara (the last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe) and her brother Sokka, Aang must travel the nations and master the elements to end the war before its too late. Team avatar is pursued by Zuko, crown prince of the Fire Nation, who was banished by his father and can not return home without capturing the Avatar.

Originally Nickelodeon only ordered thirteen episodes but the show would run for three seasons (as its creators intended) and a total of sixty-one episodes, culminating with a four part finale ""Sozin's Comet"" in July 2008. Avatar would become one of the network's most popular series, air in more than 100 countries, and spawn a multimedia franchise including a sequel animated series (Legend of Korra), comics, video games, books, figures, a poorly received a live-action film adaptation, and soon another crack at live-action in terms of a Netflix series helmed by the creators of the original series. Despite 15 years having passed since its premier, new adventures continue to be written following Aang or within the avatar universe. ATLA is also an influence for other shows such as The Dragon Prince. In this subreddit's last survey, it was rated the 11th best show of all time. Not too shabby for a kids cartoon. 

When it aired ATLA was met with acclaim from critics and fans alike. The show won various awards including 5 Annie Awards, 2 Pulcinella Awards, an Emmy Award, and a Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States. It received a  Peadbody Award for ""multi-dimensional characters, unusually complicated personal relationships for a cartoon serial, and a healthy respect for the consequences of warfare."" On a less serious note ATLA is also the only show other than SpongeBob to win the Kids Choice Award for Best Cartoon since 2003. ATLA has remained in IMDB's top fifteen rated tv series alongside shows such as Breaking Bad and The Sopranos.

Avatar The Last Airbender was created by Michael Dante Dimartino and Bryan Konietzko, and features the voice talent of Zach Tyler Eisen, Mae Whitman, Jack De Senna, Dante Basco, Jessie Flower, Grey Griffin, Dee Bradley Baker, Makoto Iwamatsu, and Mark Hamill as well as many others.

Also I find it kind of neat that the final seasons of Star Wars Clone Wars released today given that its creator, Dave Filoni, worked on Avatar and in fact directed the premier episodes.

Anyway what did you folks think of Avatar? What are your favorite moments or episodes?"

Thank you for showing us as we really are. Not what some people say in political rallies, not what the narrative of some part of the U.S political discourse tells a part of the American electorate. Our relationship historically was based on suspicision, distrust, and hate at times, but like Dylan said, ""The times are a changin'"", so many Mexicans like myself, that is a child of the internet, that grew up with Mr. Rogers and Thundercats are embracing the notion of how similar we are. 

We might not see eye to eye on many issues but we do care about you, we cared when Katrina hit and a battalion of Mexicans troops rushed to help and tons of supplies were raised in a nationwide effort. You cared when the deadliest earthquake hit Mexico City and you rushed to our help not to mention our interminable economic issues all the way until 1994. Mexico, despite the perception, is strong economically and is a country with great future and that's explained due to our join efforts.

So, thank you Conan. As a Mexican I felt so represented today, you raised the voices of million of us who when we view the U.S.A we view them as a friend, not as an enemy. 

 And for that, Thank you so much.

Edit: Thanks for all the love, in the forms of comments ,gold, PM, etc.. It truly came from the heart. And also just heard that Conan and the staff read the letter, so that's pretty damn awesome. Thank you Conan staff for coming along and having a blast, Viva Mexico! and may God bless the United States."

Hank Hill is a incredible character as well as his family and friends in Arlen, TX. I dont think there is a show that has been made that is anywhere close to resembling this unique, subtle show. I love South Park, Rick and Morty, The Simpsons, Futurama, Bob's Burgers, Archer, ect but King of the Hill is as great of a animated show that I have ever seen. It's hardly ever on tv anymore (currently watching on comedy central at 6 AM Colorado time) but it is one of those shows I want to dive deep into. I just watched the episode where Dale thinks he has rabies and is a wild man in the woods. All time classic in my mind. Thanks for listening to my rant 🙏 ps That's my purse, I dont know you!

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for your comments on this post! It turned out to be such a funny day reading all of the famous lines in said characters voices. Long live King of the Hill!"

Let me be your humble guide.

**What the hell is a witcher?**

The world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race.

In order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations.

The survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten).

The children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed.

Witchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed.

As human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated.

**What’s all this political stuff?**

Edit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\_of\_the\_witcher\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/)

The Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades.

In the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way.

**Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?**

The story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself.

Meanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates.

At the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign.

Geralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident.

Meanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge.

Geralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail.

Despite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life).

It’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being.

In the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri.

At this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly.

Ciri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay.

As the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying.

Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

Ciri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt.

When Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra."

**EDIT:** Lot of theories going around right now, but I haven't seen (of course I haven't read every single comment) anyone mention Randy being a Bernie bro. Between that and Cartman being a Trump fan, I could see some great storylines coming. Also, honorable mention to everyone who said Cartman would love Hillary instead. Yes, Hillary is corrupt and a flip flopper, but she hasn't vehemently spoken out against Muslims and Mexicans the way Trump has. Plus I love the idea of fat little Cartman walking around in a suit and tie and Trump hair. Of course only time will tell, but I'll be sorely disappointed if we don't get some prime material from this insane election season."

In keeping with his public stance that Netflix would never release ratings, he said he did not want to engage in a “weekly arms race.”

“Once we give a number for a show, then every show will be benchmarked off of that show even though they were built sometimes for very specific audiences,” he said.


He added: “There is a very natural inclination to say, ‘Relative to this show, this show is a failure.’ That puts a lot of creative pressure on the talent.”

They also revealed a new map (last one ?) with Numenor in it. Apparently the rumor about the Young Aragorn story was wrong (or they changed their minds). 

I'm not super well versed in LOTR history but it could be the Forging of the Rings or the Last Alliance War (the one in the LOTR movies prologue)


EDIT : Thanks to u/Harkoncito, for the people who don't know what is the Second Age : 

> The Second Age lasted for 3441 years and ended with the downfall of Sauron's army when he was defeated by the Last Alliance of Elves and Men following the downfall of Númenor.

> This age was characterized by the rise (eventually with increased insolence) of Númenor, the rise of Sauron in Middle-earth, the creation of the Ringwraiths, and the early wars of the Rings between Sauron and the Elves. The Ring of Power also came into existence during this period.

Essentially it's what we see in the prologue of the movie trilogy."

I found it rummaging through my in-law's basement this past weekend and wanted to share what I perceived to be a good primary source of history with the community. In light of the ""on all sides"" rhetoric I found this to be a poignant reminder of how people on opposing sides (literally, Hitler) could come together.

I never had a chance to meet Pop, but from what I'm told he was a gentleman and a scholar who was even more popular with the ladies than he was with the Nazis.

**Here is the book:**

*Edit: Many of you have asked about what type of person ""Pop"" was so I wanted to share some anecdotes from his granddaughter (my fiance):

* He deeply cared about the happiness of other people and always put them before himself.
* He was a Lifemaster of Bridge.
* He loved getting mail so much he would sign up for mailers and then gave the gifts away.
* He was always honest and told you exactly how he felt, but was nice about it.
* He constantly made new friends throughout his life and was a popular gentleman.
* He died in 2004 at the age of 83 after a long battle with cancer."

/r/history is not accepting new posts or responses, in protest against Reddit’s lack of action against racism and hate on the site.

Reddit has announced [its alignment with antiracist protesters](https://twitter.com/reddit/status/1267643352851247106?s=20). We demand to know: where are the actions to back up the words? The Reddit administrators’ policies have made their site downright hospitable to exactly the kinds of racists and fascists against whom it claims to be protesting. 

Every day our sub, which has zero tolerance for such speech, has to remove the kinds of intensely problematic and hateful rhetoric that Reddit has become a safe haven for. For example, questions and answers supporting Holocaust denial forced us to establish a clear policy of immediate deletion, as /r/AskHistorians moderator /u/commiespaceinvader describes [here](https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/the-askhistorians-subreddit-banned-holocaust-deniers-and-facebook-should-too.html).

In fact, a majority of the work we do here as moderators on /r/history goes into making sure that racists and people with other toxic ideologies don't have a platform on this subreddit. 

Later today /r/AskHistorians  will be issuing a thorough statement on the long history of police brutality against the Black community.

>Children began to be the tyrants, not the slaves, of their households.

I find that even among the splendid pieces of furniture built by our master cabinetmakers, those in the old forms are the most pleasing. And as for writing letters, surviving scraps from the past reveal how superb the phrasing used to be. The ordinary spoken language has also steadily coarsened.

>We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last … it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressor on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the civil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.

>A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.

It is either a case of waiting goodness knows how long, and we've waited all the war, or, going to live with Mary's mother.’* How often is a similar remark heard in those days, for it is the problem that young people all over the country have to face. Thousands of young fellows have come home from the war intent on setting up a home with the girl of their heart only to find that there are no homes to be had… Many men, of course, have not waited for houses, but have got married and gone into rooms or to live with relatives, but neither course can be considered very satisfactory.”

>Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline, the haste to know and do all befitting man's estate before its time, the mad rush for sudden wealth and the reckless fashions set by its gilded youth--all these lack some of the regulatives they still have in older lands with more conservative conditions.

>...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.

>The bad manners of all parliaments, the general tendency to connive at a rather shady business transaction if it promises to bring in money without work, jazz and Negro dances as the spiritual outlet in all circles of society, women painted like prostitutes, the efforts of writers to win popularity by ridiculing...the correctness of well-bred people, and the bad taste shown even by the nobility and old princely families in throwing off every kind of social restraint and time-honoured custom: all of these go to prove that it is now the vulgar mob that gives the tone.

their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes

2. >And though

they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they
come into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking
care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect

I figured I might as well post it here in case anyone else found it interesting.

1784 was about as far back as I could consistently find images for each year that were significantly different from year to year, and after 1970 fashion became a lot more diverse and harder to summarize in one picture, so I started/ ended it there. 

It's all western fashion and tends towards stuff wealthier women would have worn, particularly pre-20th century. Most of the illustrations are from fashion plates, magazines, and sewing patterns from the year stated.

8gh2ju,"With the surprising number of commenters in various subreddits that continue to confidently assert that the Holocaust is a hoax, it’s worth reviewing the prosecution and conviction of Adolf Eichmann.",22378,0.86,1170,2018-05-02 18:08:16,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8gh2ju/with_the_surprising_number_of_commenters_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8gh2ju/with_the_surprising_number_of_commenters_in/,self.history,0,7,,text,False,,False,"On May 11 1960, Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi Lieutenant Colonel and one of the primary logistical facilitators of the Holocaust, was captured by Israeli agents in Argentina where he had fled to avoid capture and prosecution. His trial in Israel was attended by journalists from major newspapers worldwide and tapes of the coverage were flown daily to the United States where they were made available for broadcast nationally. Eichmann was not found guilty of all charges, but enough of the most severe charges were deemed sufficient to sentence him to death by hanging. Eichmann’s defense team appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeal was unsuccessful. They then appealed to the president of Israel for clemency. Clemency was actually considered, especially after an emotional appeal from Eichmann’s wife and brothers and many well-respected Jewish statesmen, but ultimately denied. Eichmann was finally hanged on June 1 1962; the hanging itself was witnessed by journalists.

Through these proceedings Eichmann first claimed that he was not at all involved; then, when it was proven conclusively that he was, he insisted that he was just following orders and while he had been present at mass executions he did not arrange them personally. Eichmann’s defense team focused on questioning the admissibility of evidence, for which they were largely successful (hence his not being convicted on all charges).

At no time did Eichmann, his attorneys in their testimony, or his wife or brothers in their appeals, even attempt to suggest that the Holocaust was a hoax.

Think about that. Even if you believe that the entire trial was a sham designed to railroad an innocent man, even if you think that his entire (German and non-Jewish) defense team conspired against him, Eichmann was placed in front of hundreds of reporters and television cameras every day of a four month long trial, and never once did he turn to them and say “the so-called Holocaust never happened and I’m a totally innocent Argentinian,” even though (if there was any validity to his claim) that would have been the simplest way of preventing his own execution. Do you think he was brainwashed somehow into believing he had facilitated the deaths of millions while under arrest and interrogation? They would have also had to somehow brainwash his wife and his brothers, none of whom attempted a “there was no Holocaust” defense in their clemency letters.

In other words, to believe the Holocaust is a hoax is to believe in a conspiracy that involves some combination of all of Israel, a German defense team, hundreds of newspaper reporters from all over the world, a man’s wife and family, and the man himself, all of whom could have publicly denied the Holocaust for millions of newspaper readers and television viewers and chose not to, knowing it would lead to an innocent man’s death.

142p78c,r/history will be joining the blackout from June 12-14 to protest the proposed API changes which will end 3rd party apps.,20820,0.93,243,2023-06-07 00:04:49,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/142p78c/rhistory_will_be_joining_the_blackout_from_june/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/142p78c/rhistory_will_be_joining_the_blackout_from_june/,self.history,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"This Subreddit will be going private June 12-14. Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!

#What's going on?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app **permanently inaccessible** to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) to [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/) to [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/) to [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/) to [Boost](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoostForReddit/comments/13wstr2/with_apollo_facing_api_prices_upwards_of_20/).

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface. 
This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

#What's the plan? 

On June 12th, [many subreddits](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.

The two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.

What can *you* do?

1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at /r/ModCoord- but please don't pester mods you *don't* know by simply spamming their modmail.

3. **Boycott *and* spread the word...to Reddit's competition!** Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite *non*-Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support!

4. **Don't be a jerk.** As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible.

#**How does this impact r/history?**

Even if you only use the official Reddit app and/or ""New Reddit"" on desktop, this change still impacts all of us. r/history uses third party apps and browser extensions for its moderation. Even though I mostly use r/toolbox for my moderation, I have to use it through a special browser on my mobile to get it to work properly.

We believe that people who wish to use this subreddit in the way that's most accessible to them. We've also had several comments from people who are short sighted or even completely blind who cannot use the reddit mobile app to browse Reddit and require the use of third party apps. It's unfair for them to have to suffer.

We hope this gets the message across to Reddit. We love this Reddit and I love this sub. I want to spend as long as I can beating down unofficial versions of history and making sure that big history has a suitable place to operate from for many years to come.

(attachment in post)",19714,0.86,374,2017-04-13 21:27:47,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/656co3/my_father_a_captured_world_war_ii_resistance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/656co3/my_father_a_captured_world_war_ii_resistance/,self.history,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"My father (1919-2007) was a London-born, Dutch national, part of the World War II Dutch Underground/Resistance Movement and a German Concentration Camp survivor.  He was held captive in Krakow, Bergen-Belsen, before finally being liberated from Auschwitz by the Allied forces. Losing the majority of his family and friends in the camps, he spent most of life trying to forget his experiences, and then, spent the latter years of his life trying to remember them.


He passed away 10 years ago, leaving behind his historical fiction manuscript.  He wasn’t a writer and was not educated past high school due to the war starting; nevertheless, he was smart and hard-working and spent the better part of a decade working on it in the 1980s.

It's about his personal experiences and the personal stories of those he was friends with in the resistance and the concentration camps as told through the eyes of a fictional young, talented Dutch footballer who crosses paths with his pre-war German football rival several years into the War.  The protagonist finds that his rival, now a vindictive and powerful Nazi Commandant, is in-charge of the very Concentration Camp the young Dutchman was sent to, but his arrival there was hardly a coincidence: the German is intent on cruel revenge and the Dutchman must escape or suffer a fate worse than death. It’s a story of true accounts and real people channelled through a fictional story of a personal rivalry between two sporting heroes turned prisoner/captor. 


While the first four chapters serve only to start introductions to the various lead characters and begin to establish their motivations, the plot (which really begins when the protagonist becomes imprisoned in a concentration camp) is a tale of jealously, revenge and clever escape with themes that include youthful exuberance, love, conspiracy, world sports, Hitler, political intrigue, revenge, torture and deceit; all set in a global climate of rising Fascism, intolerance and corrupt officials. 


This manuscript is easy-to-read, compelling, and tells an exciting story. Even though I was only 12 years old when he completed it, I know the manuscript generated quite a bit of interest in Hollywood for a few years around the time he completed it, and that Willem Dafoe (actor) and Mervyn LeRoy (director) were personally championing the project, but partly due to LeRoy's untimely death, it was never made into a film.  That was thirty years ago.


My wife and I have spent time trying to get it published on our own, but as a reserved and shy couple that doesn’t spend much time “online,” our results have been mostly lacklustre.  But, we still believe that it can get published traditionally as my father had wished. While this is rather uncomfortable for us, we decided to see if social media can help bring us closer to the right people.


Linked is a pdf^[1] with the first 4 chapters of the manuscript to find an interested publisher for this book. We're not sure how many unpublished books-of-quality there are by actual Holocaust Survivors left in the world, so we decided to start sharing my father's work with kind people via Reddit, hopeful that a good person can help get his story out there.

# The Myth

In movies or historical documentaries, we’ve seen it time and time again. Two armies meet for the final time and soldiers of both sides, disregarding any sense of self-preservation, [suicidally charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDWpbmFY6o) into each other and intermingle with the enemy soldiers. Such chaos ensues that it **looks like a giant mosh pit at a rave** in which it’s impossible to **tell friend from foe**, but somehow, the people still know who to strike. They engage in **individual duels all over the field**.

When we think about it, we might ask:

„How did medieval soldiers tell friend from foe in battle?“ A very common question both on Reddit and Quora. Others might ask how did the frontline soldiers deal with the fact that they’re basically going to die – because standing in the frontline means certain death, right? That’s how it’s depicted in the movies, right? Battles were chaotic, it had to be like that! Right?

As Jonathan Frakes would put it: No way. Not this time. It’s false. It’s totally made up. It’s fiction. We made it up. It’s a total fabrication. Not this time. It’s false. It’s a myth.

It’s a bad movie trope.

# Why the trope doesn’t make sense

Humans, in general, are usually not very keen on dying or getting themselves seriously injured or crippled. We all wish to return back unscathed to our homes, families and friends. This is called [self-preservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation).

Why would medieval soldiers behave differently than any other human being?

The point is, if you run into a crowd of armed people with no regards to your safety, you die without any contribution to the battle-effort. And no one wants to die like that.

By running out of your crowd towards the enemy crowd, you lose all defensive advantages which being in a crowd provides. You will not only have enemies in front of you but everywhere around you. When that happens, it’s all over. That’s just it. Hypothetically, all your buddies could do it all at once and get as far as the fourth rank, but that will only lead to more wasteful death. This is no way to wage a battle! You don’t need to *experience it* to know it’s bullshit. Nor you need to be a trained veteran to know it’s a suicide. It’s **a common sense**. Yes, it might have looked good once in [*Braveheart*](https://youtu.be/wsYpKRbRFlc?t=12) 25 years ago, but when I see it in a modern TV show like [*Vikings*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG-_yL3KAmw) or in a movie like *Troy* or [*The King(2019)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLlxQar0mOY), it robs me of the pleasure watching it and I’d genuinely love to see it done the right way for once. If Total War games can get it almost right, why can’t the movies?

The point is, if you stay in your crowd, keeping your enemy only in front of you, while being surrounded by your friends from left, right and behind, your chances of survival increase. It is no coincidence that many different cultures over the history of mankind perfected their fighting cohesion in this manner and some even named it like *phalanx* or *scildweall*.

# Battle dynamics – What a medieval battle looks like

(Everytime there is a high stake situation, in which two huge crowds of humans gather in one place to solve a dispute by beating each other with sharp sticks to death or some other serious injury, an invisible line forms between them. (Doesn’t need to be a straight line.) If the stakes are not high and we’re in some silly football hooligan fist-fight brawl, people just ignore the line and the battle indeed becomes a chaotic mess. But the higher the stakes (possible death or other serious crippling injury), the lower the eagerness to cross that invisible line. Especially when there's a dozen fully armored men with sharp sticks pointed at you.

That is **the battle line**.

That’s why men in most medieval and ancient engagements over the course of history were arranged in most natural formation - the line formation. In small skirmishes, it might not be as vital for victory, but the larger the battle is, the more important it is to keep the line together. If this battle line is broken somewhere and the enemy pour in, the cohesion is lost and it will be easier for the opposing army to flank and overwhelm the smaller clusters of men that form as a result of their line being broken. But it also means the battle is coming to an end and that’s when people usually start running and for those who stay, chaos like in movies ensues.

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves, we’re still in the battle phase.

Do you have the image in mind? That’s right, the actual battle is only done by the first rank (and maybe second and third, if the length of their weapons allows, like spears or polearms), while the rest are maybe throwing projectiles or simply waiting to switch the frontline soldiers if they get too exhausted or injured.

# Pulse Theory (The most accurate battle model)

Few historians came up with a model called **Pulse theory** (or **'Pulse model theory'**) where they explain the crowd dynamics of a battle. I believe this model is the most accurate model we’ve come up with and it would be brilliant if movies began adopting it. That's why I'm writing about it, as I would like that more and more historical enthusiasts know about it.

In short, the armies meet and the front lines engage in harsh and heated mêlée battle. After minutes of sustained pressure, the two sides back away few paces or even whole meters away from the weapon reach. Maybe some brave show-offs step forward to exchange few blows and insults. The soldiers are maybe throwing their javelins and darts or rocks. Injured men get replaced before the two sides again engage for few minutes and disengage. This goes on and on for hours, since, as we know, battles lasted for hours. It doesn't happen all at once over the whole field, of course not. Instead only in small groups, sometimes here and sometimes there, sometimes elsewhere. Hence the name, **pulse theory**.

The reason for this is that it is psychologically and biologically (stamina) impossible for human to endure an engagement for hours. If you put yourself in the shoes of a medieval soldier, this makes sense, doesn't it? If one side backs away, but the other is overly eager to continue the fight no matter what, the battle is coming to an end.

# Frontline =/= death sentence

So far I’ve adressed why it is totally nonsensical and unrealistic to depict battles as mosh pits and introduced far more realistic model of battle. Let us adress another trope and that is – being in frontline is a certain death. For this I would simply like to bring to attention two brilliant answers written by u/Iguana_on_a_stick and u/Iphikrates which you can find in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/48pumt/did_the_people_in_the_front_lines_of_ancient/).

*(It was their answers that inspired me to re-write what they’ve already written down there 4 years ago into this subreddit. Thus I begin my quest to introduce pulse theory to movies by spreding the elightenment.)*

In short, they explain the winning sides usually, more often than not, suffered only minimal casualties. You can verify this on Wikipedia, if the battle page entry records casualties and you’ll notice the ratio yourself.

Additionally and this is important for any ancient or medieval warfare enthusiast out there, they explain why the most casualties occured not during the battle phase as movies would have you believe, but in the very last stage of the battle - after one side begins fleeing from the field. Men are more easily mowed down from behind and running rather than if they stand together in a crowd, holding shields and spears.

# Shield pushing

Lastly, they provide criticisism of *othismos* or '**shield pushing'** (a shoving match between two sides with their shields) that, according to some older historians, occured during the ancient battles. (And medieval battles as well, basically.) The battle then becomes a sort of a shoving match between two sides. Everytime a TV show or a movie attempts to depict a battle not like a total mess, they depict it like people shoving their shields into each other. You might have seen something similar in the shieldwall battle on [The Last Kingdom TV Show](https://youtu.be/as7x0SybpFc). And we've all heard it in connection to hoplites.

Personally, I appreciate the show for the attempt (although it devolves into chaotic mess at the end anyway even before the rout), but I'm absolutely not convinced that *othismos* or *'shield pushing'* was a realistic way to fight simply due to it being highly suicidal. Your shield loses its protective function. It's only possible to do it in low stake reconstructions, where the people are not afraid of death and thus are not afraid to close the distance. I'll admit that occasional pushes before quick retreats might have occured, though. Especially if one side noticed the other is already weavering.

It was more about using your spears and sniping around the shields of your enemies and look for weaknesses. But I'm open to discussion in this regard.

# Chaos

At last, we come to the premise of this post. So were battles chaotic? Yes, most definitely! But not how movies portray.

Imagine this: You are far away from home. Since the morning, you’ve been standing on some field in the middle of nowhere together with your fellow soldiers, all clad in armor during a hot summer day. Maybe two hours ago, something has finally started happening and you've already been in few clashes. You don't really know what's happening 1 kilometer or 1 mile away from you elsewhere on the field. You trust your commanders know what they're doing and you pray to whatever diety you worship. What you know for certain is that you're tired and sick in the stomach from the stress. Everywhere there’s human smell and you’re sweating your balls off as well. There’s barely enough air to breathe, just like there’s no air on a concert. Maybe you’ve even pissed yourself because there was no time to take off all the armor. You don’t know what to think and what to feel. Your whole body is telling you ‚Get out! Go home!‘ but you know you cannot just abandon your place. You most likely don't even know where exactly you are. A javelin that comes out of nowhere brings you back to full consciousness and hits your cousin standing right beside you in the face. Now they’re dragging him somewhere to the back. You might even think that you’re winning, you‘re gaining ground, while the bastards opposite of you are constantly backing away. But then you suddenly find out, that your entire flank a mile away has been routed. You see men in the far distance running for their lives away from the field towards the forest on the hill sides, while being pursued by riders on horses. You have no idea whether to hold your ground or to run as well.

That is chaotic indeed. And if the filmmakers decide one day to portray this chaos as such instead of glorifying unnecessary gore just for the sake of gore, I’m going to celebrate.

# Additional information and examples:

At the end, I would like to provide some interesting examples of high stake engagements I've found on youtube, which prove that high stakes engagements are hardly ever fought like they are fought in the movies. Invisible battle lines and to an extend, pulse theory,  are observable.

First example is [a police riot clash](https://youtu.be/f7duBZFfTs4?t=151), with police being in organized retreat. The clash is happening in the middle where two crowds meet, not all over the field, as movies would like to have you believe. The most dangerous thing that can happen to you, is when you are pulled into the enemy line – something which movies don’t get. Something similar might be observable in [the second police riot clash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8OzRXUgbk).

Third is [a high stake fight in a jail](https://youtu.be/o6kMZjmM60k?t=163). As one side is attacked out of nowhere, the fight begins very chaotically. After a while, an invisible, very dynamic battle-line forms.

My last and most favorite example is [a skirmish battle on Papua New Guinea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9zD3SwhF64). Not much of a mêlée battle, but very interesting nonetheless. The best example of pulse theory in a skirmish engagement.

I wanted to include some false examples of battle reconstructions and Battle of the Nations, but these aren't high stakes situations and people in them do not behave as they would if their lives were on the line.

Sources:  Historians P. Sabin and A. Goldsworthy are the proponents of Pulse Theory. (Check out Sabin's article *The Mechanic of Battle in the Second Punic War*, page 71 in the journal *THE SECOND PUNIC WAR A REAPPRAISAL* , where he talks about otismos (shield shoving match), self-preservation and pulse model theory.  r/AskHistorians subreddit is a goldmine that not only inspired, but fueled this whole post. There are tons of amazing threads that delve in historical warfare, I recommend reading it.

**Last thought**: My post has focused on infantry combat. I'm willing to admit that **mounted cavalry combat** might indeed have more movie-like chaotic character. This is a question I'm still gathering information about and thus I'm not able to make any claims yet, although there are already so many medieval battles which begin by two cavalry engaging. If you have some knowledge, I'd love to hear about it!

**EDIT:** Wow! It was a pleasant surprise to see all your responses, I'm so glad you enjoyed the read. One huge thank you for all the awards and everything! This might sound utterly silly, I know, but the purpose is to spread the knowledge (and increase people's expectations from a historical genre) so that in the end, one day, we might get a movie with a perfect battle. Although this post is just a drop in the sea, the knowledge is spreading and I'm glad for it.

EDIT2: Found another academic source of the discussed theory. Check out the article *The Face of Roman Battle (*The Journal of Roman Studies) by P. Sabin, where he discusses everything in this post in more detail than my previous source."

The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued.

He then goes on to write about how the City of Athens posted a warning to future buyers, but a stranger to Athens bought it because of the extremely low price. The buyer did experience everything he was warned about and even saw the ghost itself. It led him to a certain spot in the house and then vanished. The next day he asked the lawmakers of Athens for permission to dig up that spot. 

He then says, ""the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and mouldered away from the fetters. The bones, being collected together, were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more."""

I am curious as to how burrying 200,000 men alive was accomplished. (asuming it was against their will) and how a rebel army of 130,000 ended the first imperial dynasty of China, by defeating an army of 500,000  Any information would be much appreciated. 

Edit: I never imagined this post being viewed a quarter million times. I enjoy reading all the comments. A common and understandable thread is disbelief,  but it appears to me that this event did in fact happen. Of course the numbers are questionable, but consider the possibilities in light of information from some commenters knowledgeable of the era and subject. The Qin dynasty (with a population of around 40 million, comparable to the napoleonic empire 2,000 years later) practiced universal conscription, meaning every adult male could be drafted and every adult could be mobilized for state projects. ""Fielding one million men for the Qin was certainly possible"" writes Charles Holcombe, so the size of the army was not out of question. In 1912, workers on the Longhai Railway in Henan, (where the burial is said to have occured) discovered burial pits containing human remains. This area was known by locals as the ""million people pit"" and was reported to be 400 meters long and 250 meters wide. Certainly big enough for the 200,000 reported, although many think the number was much smaller."

Previously, a CIA mission codenamed ""OPERATION PBSUCCESS"" had deposed the democratically elected leftist government of Guatemala and installed a right-wing, pro-American military junta in its place ([1954 Guatemalan coup d'état](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27état)). Starting in 1960, leftist guerrilla movements began fighting the military government, and were backed by the Maya people. Then, the Guatemalan military took upon itself the goal of eliminating all socialist guerrillas and supporters, whether real or suspected, which included Maya civilians. The Maya were systematically executed or disappeared, often at the hands of right-wing paramilitary death squads such as [Mano Blanca](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mano_Blanca). Although Mano Blanca was one of the most notorious death squads, described by leading novelist Paul Theroux as ""Guatemala's version of a volunteer Gestapo unit,"" it received aid from the CIA. Many other death squads received aid from both the Guatemalan government and the CIA, primarily in the form of training and armament. 

The US knew about and enabled Guatemalan atrocities. A good example of why the US supported the Guatemalan government anyway  is given in the Wikipedia article on the [Central American crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_crisis): ""In particular, the United States feared that victory by communist forces would threaten the Panama Canal and would isolate the rest of South America from the United States if the countries of Central America were to be installed with pro-soviet communist governments."" As a result, the CIA, fearful of Soviet influence in Central America becoming similar to Soviet influence in Cuba, chose to turn a blind eye to (and often enable) the Guatemalan genocide. 

Hope you found this enlightening.

The source is listed as a book published in Russia in the 1990s. So although it might be taken with a grain of salt, overall style seems to fit.

""To teacher comrade Martyshin.
I have received your letter about escapades of Vasily Stalin. Thank you for the letter. Replying with a great delay because of being overloaded with work. My apologies. Vasily is a spoiled young man of average abilities, little wildman, not always honest, likes to blackmail weak ""teachers"", not rarely an insolent fellow,  with weak - or more accurately - unorganized willpower.

He was spoiled by various ""god fathers"" and ""god mommies"", who continually emphasize that he is ""Stalin's son"". I am glad that in your person there is at least one self-respecting teacher who treats Vasily as everyone else and demands that the insolent boy follows the school's policy. Vasily is spoiled by principals like the one you mentioned, washcloth-people [means spinless in Rus.], who have no place at school; and if insolent Vasily hasn't destroyed himself yet it is because our country still has teachers who don't give slack to the little young swell.

My advice: demand stricter from Vasily and don't be affraid of fake blackmail threats of ""suicide"" from the capricious child. You will have my support.

Unfortunately I don't have the opportunity to fuss with Vasily myself. But promise to grab him by the collar from time to time.

Cheers!""

Edit: Vasily was born in 1921. So he was 17 in 1938.
Edit 2: comments say that 'washcloth' can be translated as 'wet rag' or 'limp rag'. It does seem to sound better. "

Last year I've seen a lot of redditors that let their grandparents have an AMA, mostly about their experiences in WWII, but these stories are always from the Europian/Western side. Although very interesting I've always felt that the Asian side isn't told that much. At least in my case, we Dutchies learn almost nothing about the history and culture of our former colonies like Indonesia. Such imporant things happend there, but people simply don't know anything about them.

My grandmother was born in Indonesia during the '30, so I was lucky she could tell me wonderful stories (relatively, of course) about everything she's experienced. The struggles during the war: being a half-blood she and her entire family ended up in one of the concentration camps during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. After that her immigration to the Netherlands: she was kicked out of her homeland and had to move to a new and strange country where they didn't exactly get welcomed, they barely spoke the language of, and had to survive with almost no posessions.

I thought her life-story might give a unique angle on the past and if you guys would find it interesting I could arrange an AMA on /r/IAmA/. Let me hear your thoughts! 

**EDIT:** Wow the response was much greater than I first anticipated, thanks for your feedback! I'll speak with my grandmother about this and I'll arrange the AMA!

**EDIT2:** If people stuble to this edit: the date's been arranged. It will be comming saturday 30-04, probably around our midday. I'm in the process running it through the official channels, whereafter you'll hear about a more exact time!

I have not been able to find any english language news on this yet, but you can see pictures from the area and the georadar picture of the ship.

&#x200B;

But long story short, by using Ground penetrating radar, archeologists from NIKU (Norwegian institute of heritage research)  have discovered several burial mounds and houses from the viking age, and a buried 20 meter long viking ship, making it one of the biggest ships discovered in Norway. The three viking ships displayed at the Viking Museum in Oslo are the Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune ships, at 21, 23 and 19 meters.

&#x200B;

It has been known for many years that the area has graves, but no one was expecting to find a ship, which will be the first large viking ship discovered in Norway in a hundred years. It is impossible to tell how the condition of the ship will be, until they uncover it.

8p5ouo,"On June 6th, 1944, John Ford commanded a film crew on Omaha Beach. Most of the footage was accidentally dropped overboard.",11776,0.94,345,2018-06-07 05:33:55,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8p5ouo/on_june_6th_1944_john_ford_commanded_a_film_crew/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8p5ouo/on_june_6th_1944_john_ford_commanded_a_film_crew/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"During World War II, Hollywood directors such as John Huston and John Ford volunteered for service with the military (Army, and Navy, respectively), where their talents were put to the best use, namely making movies. They, and others, were tasked with creating films for domestic consumption to bring the war home to American audiences, in other words, propaganda. Ford, for instance, shot the film ""Battle of Midway"", during the fight itself, although in part it was sheer luck he was present, the Navy having already sent him there to shoot more tranquil footage. He recalled the irony afterwards that ""*I think at the time there was some report of some action impending but [...] I didn’t think it was going to touch us. So I [...] spent about 12 hours a day in work, had a good time up there.*”

By far most famously though was D-Day. The Allies intended to thoroughly document their triumph there, and several hundred ships were equipped with movie cameras, as were some 50 landing craft, all constantly rolling and not needing human touch. In addition, Ford , along with George Stevens, was given film crews to be sent on in with the troops, part of a documentary force that numbered in the hundreds when you include still photographers (Ford was attached to the Navy and OSS, Stevens to the Army, and coordinated very little). Stevens run shooting at Juno Beach with the British [To clarify, yes, Canadians landed on Juno. Stevens was working off of a Royal Navy ship], while Ford was in charge for Omaha, where the most intense fighting was. He would actually refuse to talk about it for many years after, but did eventually offer his recollections:

>Once I was on the beach I ran forward and started placing some of my men behind things so they’d have a chance to expose their film. I know it doesn’t sound blazingly dramatic. [....] To tell the truth I was too busy doing what I had to do for a cohesive picture of what I did to register in my mind. We stayed on the job and worked that day and for several other days and nights too.

Ironically, for all their efforts, almost none of the footage would see the light of day, for several unfortunate causes. In the first, much of the footage was destroyed, packed into a duffle-bag that was accidentally dropped into the water! As for what little remained, after being processed in London a few days later, at least according to Ford ""[a]pparently the government was afraid to show so many casualties on screen."" The camera crews hadn't held back, and it was simply too real for the people back home, it would seem. It was not entirely lost though. Those familiar with the story from Stephen Ambrose's book on D-Day will likely only know the conclusion at that point, when no one knew where the footage was still, but since that time, some of it was, in fact, rediscovered in US government storage, although just how much remains unclear, and almost none of that has ever been released

As detailed in this 2000 article from [Time](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,46456,00.html):

>Yet somehow Ford's footage was lost until 1998, when Melvyn R. Paisley, a World War II aviator and Reagan-era Assistant Secretary of the Navy, found a few canisters of the missing film deep within the National Archives. Spielberg, whose father had also served in the U.S. Army Air Corps and who would win the Best Director Oscar for his own D-day movie, Saving Private Ryan, was intrigued when he read about Paisley's find in the New Yorker.

>So intrigued, in fact, that he recruited documentary maker and TIME film critic Richard Schickel and immediately started hunting for more raw footage from World War II. With Paisley's help, they amassed 600 hours' worth and began editing the remarkable trove. The result is Shooting War, a spectacularly conceived and haunting 90-min. documentary that premieres June 5 [2000], in conjunction with the opening of the National D-Day Museum, at a conference sponsored by the Eisenhower Center at the University of New Orleans.

The Shooting War, at least, [is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAeXGNbxh2I), but it is about war photographers during WWII, not D-Day, so the actual D-Day footage is only a small part. [This is the timestamp for when D-Day starts up](https://youtu.be/ZAeXGNbxh2I?t=524). What parts are actually Ford's team's footage seems to be unclear, as much of it was legitimately lost, Paisley only recovering part of it. [This I think is when it starts](https://youtu.be/VRohPHLHeLI?t=52), as as you can see, it is quite brief, shot by a cameraman who was wounded and evacuatted early on, presumably keeping his footage out of the cursed duffle.

Other D-Day footage of course exists. The aforementioned George Stevens, similarly tasked to run shooting at Juno Beach, also has surviving footage, [some of which is excerpted here for instance.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10861960/World-War-Two-as-you-have-never-seen-it-extremely-rare-colour-footage-of-D-Day-invasion-released.html) But the Omaha footage is almost entirely lost to the ages.

More broadly focused on the Hollywood men who contributed by shooting the war, ""Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War"" by Mark Harris is a book on the topic, focusing on Ford and Huston, as well as Frank Capra, George Stevens, and William Wyler, who were also involved in the war effort.

Additionally, an extensive interview by Ford was given in 1964 which expands upon the above quotations. He was speaking with Peter Martin, and it was published in The American Legion Magazine, Volume 76, No. 6 (June 1964). Conversely though, Ford's account must be balanced by allegations that his recollections were mostly fabricated. While he certainly was assigned to run the filming, [he may very well have done so while never setting foot on the beach!](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/truth-or-tall-tales-director-john-fords-dday-account-discredited-20140610-zs1tq.html):

>""How would I describe my job?"" John Ford said, when I asked him. ""Unofficially, I was in charge of cinemaphotography, but in all honesty I was really more or less a logistic officer. It was up to me to see that everybody who should have a camera had one. I take my hat off to my Coast Guard kids. They were impressive. They went in first, not to fight, but to photograph. They went with the troops. They were with the first ones ashore. They filmed some wonderful material. Fortunately, most of them came through well. There were a few casualties. I lost some men. It is a coincidence that one of the cameramen who works for me today — his name is Archie Stout — had a son in my outfit. He was one of the two photographers who rode ashore on a Phoenix concrete breakwater. He rode his Phoenix all the way over from England photographing everything in sight. He did a fine job riding that big box. He got a Silver Star for it. Later, he was to be flown back to England to sign his papers for a commission for which he certainly qualified in every way. On his way, even before he'd left France, a lone German fighter popped out of nowhere and shot him down. He's buried there in a cemetery where the landing was. That cemetery was a new one and Stout's was one of the first graves there. I've been back to it several times to leave flowers. 

>""I think it's amazing that I lost no more, when you consider how much some of them were exposed to fire, although I wouldn't let them stand up. I made them lie behind cover to do their photographing. Nevertheless, they didn't have arms, just cameras, and to me, facing the enemy defenseless takes a special kind of bravery. When a man is armed with a gun he's probably much braver than if he doesn't have one. 

>""In action, I didn't tell my boys where to aim their cameras. They took whatever they could. Once they got ashore they just started photographing our troops in different groups rushing to their assigned places. Not that they rushed wildly, they rushed with a definite purpose. After they got ashore, they made for a certain objective. There was no panic or running around. I've often wondered why they didn't run faster. Probably they weighed too much with all their equipment on. They hurried, but there was no frantic dash, just a steady dogtrot. 

>""I remember meeting Col. Red J. Reeder on the beach. I knew him well and I met him a long time later when I went to West Point to do a picture. The Long Gray Line. On D-Day, Red was sitting with one leg smashed so badly it had to be amputated. 'Got any orange juice?' he asked me. I said, 'Orange juice! What the hell would I be doing carrying orange juice? How- about a shot of brandy?' We had been issued little bottles of brandy in case anybody needed it. Doggedly he said, 'No, I want orange juice.' I said. Colonel, I'm afraid that's something I can't get you, but I can help you get back to our ship which is close in. Once there you can get some aid.' He said, 'No, I just want some orange juice.' Red and I had a laugh about that long afterward at West Point. In a moment of crisis, people get funny fixations. I asked him, 'Why didn't you take that brandy?' He said, i don't know. It's the first time in my life I ever refused a drink of hard liquor. All of a sudden I was pure. As a matter of fact, I don't even like orange juice.' He was in shock, and as I've said, they had to cut off his leg in an emergency operation. 

>""The film my men took was processed in London, in both color and black-and-white. Most of it was in Kodachrome. It was transferred to black-and-white for release in the news weeklies in movie theaters. All of it still exists today in color in storage in Anacostia near Washington, D.C. My cutting unit was in London, too. They worked 24-hour watches, picking out the best part of the film that had been shot. I'm sure it was the biggest cutting job of all time including the cutting done for the recent picture Cleopatra. The cutters worked four-hour shifts — on four, off four. Allen Brown, the producer, now a captain in the Reserve, was in charge. There were literally millions of feet of film. When Brown's unit saw something they liked, they pressed a button, and put clips on that portion of film. When they cut the stuff  all they did was cut at the places marked  by those clips. It saved a lot of time. Very  little was released to the public then —  apparently the Government was afraid  to show so manv American casualties on  the screen. After all. even The New York  Times best-seller list that summer had  only six 'war books' on it out of a total  of 30. 

>""As I've said, I don't think I ever saw  more than a dozen men at one time on  that beach. That's all my eye could take  in. For that matter. I don't think any-  body on the beach saw more than 20 at  the outside. After all. they all were at-  tacking in small groups. They were  trained to do that. The first wave consisted of about 3.000 men. and not all of  them got ashore alive. Numerically, that  wasn't so many really.

The author argues we don’t actually have conclusive evidence the Greeks couldn’t “see” blue; it’s more that they used a different color palette entirely, and also blue was the most difficult dye to manufacture. Even so, we see a curious lack of a term to describe blue in certain other ancient cultures, too. I find this particularly jarring given that blue is seemingly ubiquitous in nature, most prominently in the sky above us for much of the year, depending where you live. 

What are some other examples of seemingly objective concepts that turn out to be highly dependent on language, culture and other, more subjective facets of being human?

During WWII a lot of countries were experimenting with using animals as weapons. One of the great ideas of the U.S. was a cat guided bomb. The basic thought process was that cats always land on their feet, and they hate water. So scientist figured if they put a cat inside a bomb, rig it up to a harness so it can control some flaps on the bomb, and drop the bomb near a ship out in the ocean, the cat's natural fear of water will make it steer the bomb twards the ship. And there you go, cat guided bomb. Now this weapon system never made it past testing (aparently the cats always fell unconcious mid drop) but the fact that someone even had the idea, and that the government went along with this is baffling to me.


Is there a more ridiculous weapon in history that tops this? It can be from any time period, a single weapon or a whole weapon system, effective or ineffective, actually used or just experimental, if its weird and ridiculous I want to hear about it!

NOTE: The Bat and pigeon bombs, Davey Crocket, Gustav Rail Gun, Soviet AT dogs and attack dolphins, floating ice aircraft carrier, and the Gay Bomb have already been mentioned NUNEROUS time. I am saying this in an attempt to keep the comments from repeating is all, but I thank you all for your input!

>It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather ""nonviolently"" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: ""The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.""

From the [Letter from a Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) 

I was hearing a brazillian podcast episode on MLK. They called black participants and heard them on the topic. And one of the things that I thought was interesting is that many of them said that the version of MLK being pure peacefull is a whitewashed version. In this letter he puts on the same level, officers peacefully reprimanding protesters to maintain immoral ends as those who commit violence as a mean of protesting. And with this it made more sense when I read someone saying here that MLK had 25% approval before his death. I think this would be a controversial take even today. So I really wanna know, is this number of approval true? How many more things that would be controversial political takes today don't end up on school books from MLK history? I have to say that I don't really know much about him because we don't study him much in brazilian schools, so forgive me if I said any foolishness and forgive me for my english.

Edit: Considering the repercursion of this post, I wanna ask for everyone: please read the full letter. This quote is just one paragraph, there are a lot of important messages in this letter. I wanna quote one more:

6rt8kn,I Asked my Grandfather about his experience in German occupied Netherlands in World War II. I was amazed at all that happened to him and his family.,10489,0.91,619,2017-08-05 23:33:34,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6rt8kn/i_asked_my_grandfather_about_his_experience_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6rt8kn/i_asked_my_grandfather_about_his_experience_in/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"For some reason asking my Grandfather about his experiences during World War II never really crossed my mind. I am a History/Political Science major in university and the World Wars always fascinated me so when i saw him recently I decided to ask him. Some of his stories were really amazing. 

My Grandfather was 10 years old and living in the Netherlands during World War II. His older brother was enlisted in the war and was taken as a PoW only three years into the war. His other brother was arrested at a check stop and placed into a work camp. My Grandfather recalled when the Germans first took control of Holland they bombed Rotterdam as a show of power to try and stop any thoughts of rebellion. My Grandfather lived in a farm near Rotterdam and he recalled hearing the explosions and seeing the city burn and smell the smoke in the air for days. 

My Grandfather's family owned a grain farm. In one of the silos they built a false bottom and under it they hid Jewish refugees. As the German army still needed food their farm was one of the few places that was not cut off of electricity. Because of this they were able to run electricity down below the silo so that the refugees could have light. When the Germans would come to inspect the farm or search for Jews my Grandfather would run to the edge of the silo and pee against the wall. As he was peeing he would talk down a small hole and tell the refugees the Germans were there. 

After Holland was occupied the Germans placed explosives on the underside of of bridges so that in case of an invasion they could cover their retreat. My Grandfather was tasked with finding out where the fuse wires went so that in case of an invasion they could cut these cords and help the allied army. My Grandfather was chosen to do this as a 12 year old boy is much less suspicious than an adult going around bridge. He was also often tasked with hiding fake passports and stolen food stamps at check stops as the soldiers were less likely to search children. 

I always knew that my Grandfather lived in Holland during the German occupation but i didn't know at all to the extent that they were involved in hiding Jews or any kind of underground resistance movement. It made World War II much more real to me knowing my own Grandfather had lived through it. 

If you have parents, grandparents, great grandparents anyone you know who has lived through events such as a world war ask them about it! I'm sure many of them would be more than happy to share their experiences and sadly most of the generation that lived through these events have already passed on.

Even people too, sometimes I'll see someone and they just look like they could've been born 2000 years ago. And vice verse if you took any person from years ago but they were born today, perhaps snatched an ancient roman right as they were born, they would fit in just fine- maybe they'd love video games, love cars, and perhaps be no different from your average man. 

Seeing black and white photographs whose quality gets worse the further back in time you go, gives a false perception of the world.  Look outside. That's what it looked like. Not some grainy greyscale world.  This is also why I love seeing colorized photgraphs.. It just seems to add another layer of *realness* to it.


EDIT: Wow! So I read through all the comments and it brought up some more interesting points...    

- how much do you know about your great great grandfather? Do you even know what he looks like? With today's technology, our great ancestors hundreds of years in the future will see our life in HD (or perhaps HD will seem unimaginable unsophisticated) but my ancestors in 500 years could see videos of me with friends, making dumb home videos, laughing into the camera, playing sports, and they could see the great leaders and events today.  9/11 will probably be taught in history class for hundreds of years. They won't just read out of a text book though, they'll see the videos....

I will pay you the balance I owe in a short time without some hindering providence more than I know of at this time.  Write whether you will come in this fall or not as what you intend doing. If all the heirs are willing I think Caroline ought to have everything for ------- with our mother. I think she ought to have what bedding and furniture her mother had.  Her funeral expenses was 18 dollars and some cents.  Her doctor bill I have not ascertained. What stock belonged to her will about pay the above.  1 cow and calf, 8 or 10 sheep 5 hogs which belonged to mother will come very near paying the above.  If what property mother had is sold it will be but a mere triffle when divided.  I am willing to sign my interest over to Caroline if the balance will do the same.  I have wrote to Langford to the same effect and to Morgan also.  Write and let us know what you intend doing whether you can come in the fall or not.  Write as soon as you get this letter.  If you come in this fall I would be glad you would have that deed fixed and bring it.  As I may take a notion to sell.  I must bring my letter to a close but nothing more at present but remaining your Brother until death.

(Orlando Figes, *Revolutionary Russia, 1891-1991*, Pelican (2014, p. 129)

But less speculatively, would the revolution have proceeded as it did without Lenin? Figes says ""Lenin's intervention was decisive"" but would the likes of Stalin or Trotsky have still been able to force through the Bolshevik coup and take control?

As I understand it the cult of personality around Lenin did not really begin until the following year when he survived an assassination attempt. How vital was he at this point?"
8ekmp2,The letter Charles III of Spain wrote to his parents telling them about his wedding night,9722,0.94,1169,2018-04-24 19:33:29,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8ekmp2/the_letter_charles_iii_of_spain_wrote_to_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/8ekmp2/the_letter_charles_iii_of_spain_wrote_to_his/,self.history,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"In 1738, [Charles III of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain) married [Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Amalia_of_Saxony), daughter of Polish king Augustus III and an educated, cultured woman who gave birth to 13 children, eight of whom reached adulthood.

 The marriage responded to political'needs', but the couple enjoyed a romantic and harmonious union. After the death of his stepbrother Ferdinand VI with no descendants, Charles was crowned king of Spain as Charles III in 1759. A year later his wife died and he never remarried. Charles III remained a widower for the rest of his life without ever having a mistress.

>*In 22 years of marriage, this is the first serious upset I've had from Amalia. The pain that this irreparable loss causes me is equal to the tender love I professed for her.*

This is the letter that Charles III wrote to his parents in July 1738, telling them about his wedding night:

> *My very dear Father and my very dear Mother, I was happy to know that your Majesties are still doing fine, me and my wife are perfectly well, thank God. I received a letter from your Majesties on the 15th of last month, in which I saw how, thanks be to God, your Majesties had received two of my letters.*
> 
> *You assumed that by the time I received this letter my heart would be glad and I would have consummated the marriage. You told me that sometimes young girls are not so easy and that, with this hot weather, I should try to save my energy, not doing it as much as I wanted because it could ruin my health, that I should be content with once or twice times between night and day, that otherwise I would end up exhausted and that is better to serve the ladies little and continuously than a lot once.*
> 
> 
> *About what you asked regarding her height, I will tell your Majesties that according to the portrait I have of my sister, they are nothing alike. With all due respect to my sister, my wife is much prettier and much whiter. She shoots very well and takes a lot of pleasure from hunting.*
> 
> *Your Majesties wrote me as parents and as married people, and asked me to tell you if everything went well and if I find her to my liking, both her body and her spirit, so I’ll tell you how it all went down.*
> 
> *The day I met her in Portella, we spoke lovingly, until we arrived at Fondi. There we had dinner and then continued our journey having the same conversation until we arrived in Gaeta a little late.  Between the time she needed to get undressed and to undo her hair, it was dinnertime and I couldn't do anything, even though I really wanted to.* 
> 
> *We went to bed at nine o'clock and both of us were shaking but we started to kiss and I was soon ready, so I started and after 15 minutes I broke her (her hymen). This time none of us could spill (ejaculate). About what you told me about her being young and delicate, warning me that she would make me sweat, I will say that the first time I was sweating like a fountain but I have not sweat since then.* 
> 
> 
> *Later, at three o’clock in the morning, I started again and we both ""spilled"", both at the same time, and since then we have continued like this, doing it two times a night except for the night when we had to come here since we had to wake up at four o’clock in the morning and we could only do it once. I assure you that I could have done it many more times but I’m controlling myself as you advised.*
> 
>*I will also say that we always ""spill"" at the same time because we always wait for each other. She is the most beautiful girl in the world, she has the spirit of an angel and the best disposition. I am the happiest man in the world having this woman who will be my companion for the rest of my life.*
> 
> *Your Majesties told me that you were eagerly waiting to find out if you were going to have grandchildren. I’ll tell your Majesties that she doesn’t have her period yet, but, by all appearances, she will soon because four days ago she started leaving some stains of this material they say precedes the period.*
> 
> *My wife begs me to place her with the utmost submission at the feet of your Majesties.*

The revelation is not only a milestone in terms of muography technology and scientific approach used to reveal the secret chamber, but will hopefully lead to significant insights into how the pyramids were built.

Ivan is said to have personally killed the Emperor in the combat. He then stomped Mongol raiders in Northern Bulgaria and defended against the Byzantines after marrying the Emperor's second wife.

War is a blasted stinking show for a cause which is soon forgotten, and which is fed by propaganda and fanned by hysteria. The bugles blow and the bands play, but that is not the true picture you see. War is for the Generals and they see the glory, but not the honor and hardship of their field troops. Medals are never given deservedly to many – many who should be recognized – and a medal bestowed is from then on to be hidden, and bow your head if you ever show one when that war is over.

The code of men who really know and see is silence, because of a civilian ignorance and misunderstanding. All wars are the same and cannot be reported by anyone. Who can, if he is caught in the terrific noise and confusion, the filth, the disease, cold – and then so hot you stink like a dirty animal, - scared – wondering when, and not asking why?

It is not a glamorous, glorious affair; crabs, cooties, some with venereal diseases, hidden, by some, from inspection; gas that is sneaky and dangerous.

Hate the German? I never could, because he is in the same situation as you. He doesn’t like it either.

Don’t look for glamour. There is none. Correspondents can write and pick their spots. We can’t.""

This was written in my great grandfather's diary which he wrote while in Europe during World War One. Initially he served with the British Expiditionary Force before the US joined the war. Later he was serving with the US Army as a Lieutenant. He was injured when a shell exploded near him in the trenches and ruptured his eardrum which resulted in hearing problems after the war. This was one of the last pages of his diary.

It was about how my great-grandfather basically fked up, but also about the resilience of the family afterwards.

Picture of my grandfather when he was 20 and now (age 86): https://imgur.com/a/kxqzO

Grandfather story time:

""During the colonial era of Taiwan, the Japanese were fair rulers most of the time, but of course some abused their power. I was still a child in grade 3 when this happened. My father got in a physical fight with a Japanese policeman over an argument that had escalated. When my mother and brother tried to stop the fight, my father stuck a hoe into the policeman's back. It was a serious wound. My parents and my elder brother fled the scene and hid in a bamboo grove. Meanwhile the local police station dispatched 20 men to my house to look for my parents, but all they found was my little brother and I, both still children at the time. 

The police decided to leave us alone and searched the bamboo grove after they received news that my parents were hiding there. However, by that time, it was too late and my parents fled to another grove already. The police tracked them into the new grove, but they fled to another and another after that. The police were always one-step behind. Eventually my parents and eldest brother fled to my mother’s house in another town. I and my other siblings were left home alone and took care of household affairs. We had contact with my parents who were still in hiding, and this went on for about a month until my parents decided to spend the family’s fortune to bribe local Japanese officials and influential Taiwanese households who were on good terms with the Japanese. The bribe worked, but as a result, we lost our family fortune. At the time, my family was considered one of the oldest and richest in the entire area, but now we had nothing but our name, house, and farmland. 

The Japanese locked up my parents and my brother for only one week and let them go, writing off the assault as an accident. Afterwards, my parents had to work hard to grow enough produce to sell and feed our large family. Of course, I helped too. At the time, I was still a teen. Before the sun even rose, I rode my bike miles to another town called Madou/麻豆, where the vegetables were much cheaper. I biked to Madou, bought vegetables there and came back to my town (Jiali/佳里) in time for the morning market sales. I sold the vegetables for a cheaper price than the other merchants did and so I sold out every time. After that, I still had to go to school. That’s how my family went from rich to poor. After the Japanese left, the Kuomintang (Republic of China) rule was much harsher, and they forced everyone to exchange their silver and gold for Chinese currency and the entire market inflated. Everyone became poor, especially farmers. If we spoke Japanese or Taiwanese, it was considered treason and they locked you up, some people never came back. It was hard to learn Mandarin after so many years of Japanese education. We had to join the Republican Chinese army and we picked up Mandarin out of fear. I don’t remember much of my Japanese anymore, only the basics like “Mango ga oishii!"" (mangos are tasty).""

EDIT: For those of you wondering, I am Taiwanese-Canadian and my family immigrated to Canada when I was 3 years old. I do still speak Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien natively. I also took up Japanese in university out of interest. My grandpa still lives in Jiali District, Tainan, Taiwan."

Yes, there were others, like teenager Claudette Colvin, who protested on the bus before Parks and didn’t receive the same kind of notoriety. Not sure that this is a story about “who did it first” anyway, but what people don’t realize is that Parks had been a lifelong civil rights activist. 

Not just an activist for a day. 

She started officially working for the NAACP in 1943 (the bus protest occurred on December 1, 1955). At that time, the NAACP was considered a suspect group by law enforcement, so just being associated with them was a risk. She traveled across the South, gathering accounts from women who said they had been raped by police. She ran a student-activism group in Montgomery. She was the secretary for E.D. Nixon, then President of the NAACP Montgomery chapter.

Her grandparents were slaves. Her grandfather was the product of a white plantation owner and a slave. Though light-skinned, their family wasn’t spared from the terror of the KKK. As a child, she would stay up all night with her grandfather, guarding their home from KKK raids with a shotgun.

Due in part to history books and that Drunk History episode, many folks think her bus protest was planned, that she was sitting in the white section, and that she was “picked” to protest because of her nice old lady demeanor. None of this is true.

Parks was not sitting in the white section, but behind it. When the white section filled and a white male passenger entered the bus, the driver demanded that she move even further back. That’s when she refused to move. Most people don’t realize, Black folks were also asked to pay at the front of the bus, then get back off and enter through the back. At times, drivers would just leave before they could get back on. Parks had a bad experience with this same bus driver many years earlier and usually avoided his busses.

Her protest wasn’t planned. This is supported by myriad historical documents and even Parks’ own written accounts in her private diaries — just released to the public by the Library of Congress. She was 42 years old when she was arrested, not a weak elderly woman. And she wasn’t “chosen” by movement leaders to do anything — the movement itself was just getting started. MLK was virtually unknown outside of the Montgomery Baptist community. There had been a series of events in the summer and fall preceding the Montgomery Bus Boycott that began to foment action in the Black community in Alabama, namely Emmett Till’s Murder and subsequent acquittal of his admitted murderers by an all-white jury.

There is definitely some truth to the idea that Colvin was passed over as a poster child, namely, because she was a child. Rosa Parks did know of her arrest, so in a way Colvin could have contributed to Rosa reaching her breaking point.

The NAACP decided to publicly pursue Rosa’s legal case after her arrest because there was momentum. And because she was a TRAINED activist who could handle the scrutiny. This is not to say that the civil rights leadership embraced her strategic mind necessarily, as it was for the most part a sexist organization. Women were routinely not allowed to make speeches at large events. The summer before the bus boycott Parks took nonviolent protest training classes at the Highlander folk school in Tennessee. After her arrest she received death threats, lost her job, was forced to leave Montgomery, and she lived in poverty in Detroit for many years — not exactly the kind of thing you want to put on a teenager like Colvin. 

Ironically, Colvin’s 5-plaintiff legal case was actually the one that ended segregation on Alabama busses, not Rosa’s. Colvin’s case went all the way to the Supreme Court and won.

Park’s activism continued literally until her death. She spoke at the Selma to Montgomery March (ABC news archives has video of her speech and it’s amazing) and the 1963 March on Washington. She participated in several anti-Vietnam protests and through the 1970s and 1980s worked in U.S. Representative John Conyer’s office in Detroit. She created a scholarship foundation that took middle and high school students on civil rights tours across the South, educating them about the heroic work of other activists.

Her story is one everyone thinks they know and most of what they know is wrong. 

I am in no way the authority on her life or the civil rights movement and I do not work for the LoC, but I spent months working with some of the most incredible researchers and historians at the Library of Congress and learned an immense amount from them. 

EDIT: Some sources, including the current Library of Congress exhibit. I can provide direct links to individual primary source documents in the Library’s Rosa Parks collection (the public stuff) if that is of interest to people...I encourage folks to explore the collection’s manuscripts!

Since suggestions aren't allowed there, I thought I would come here.

(In no particular order)

* [Timeline - World History Documentaries](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg) - has a ton of exceptionally made documentaries, all around 40 minutes or more, ranging from every period of history you can think of. They are like TV quality (maybe they actually aired on tv, Idk). Not only one of my favorite history channels, but one of my favorite youtube channels period. I **highly** recommend it.

* [LEMMiNO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRcgy6GzDeccI7dkbbBna3Q) - If you like history, drop everything and check this channel out right now. This channel is ABSOLUTELY amazing. The videos are so well made and narrarated that it's crazy. He covers mostly more recent events, mainly focused on strange events, but does so with a professional and non-tinfoil-hatty perspective. Check out his videos: The Vanishing of Flight 370, The Battle of Los Angeles, The Unknowns Mystifying UFO Cases, or any others.

* [The Armchair Historian](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUJFQ0D9qs6aVNyUt9fkeQ) - This is a history channel specializing in animated military history. The videos are very professionally done, and the host is pretty good. The videos are mostly animated, and around 10 minutes long, give or take.

* [Epic History TV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvPXiKxH-eH9xq-80vpgmKQ) - Another great history channel, with videos focusing on giant conflicts like World War One, history of nations such as Russia, to the true story behind legends like Blackbeard the pirate. He uses really nice looking animated maps, images, and carefully researches his scripts. Definitely one of my favorite history channels, I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a video rec, try his Napoleonic Wars 6 part series.

* [Kings and Generals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmaBzfCCwZ2KqaBJjkj0fw/featured) - They have videos covering the Mongol invasions, Hundred Years' War, Napoleonic Wars, Ottoman Conquests and the Restoration of Justinian, and many more. Another exceptional history channel that I highly recommend.

* [Potential History](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU22SYUm7Z1COjASmmQG1aA/featured) - From channel's description: *""Did you ever hear the tragedy of King Tiger the heavy? I thought not. It's not a story the Panzerwaffe would tell you. It's a Wehraboo legend. King Tiger was a Heavy Tank of the Wehrmacht, so Armored and so deadly he could use his cannon to influence the 88mm shells to Burn Shermans... He had such an unnecessary amount of armor that he could even keep the ones who crewed him, from dying. The German tank design theory is a pathway to many monstrosities some consider to be under powered. What happened to him? He became so up-armored and heavy... the only thing he was afraid of was destroying his transmission, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his adversaries everything he knew, then his adversaries copied the good parts of his design after the war. It's ironic he could save others from damage, but not himself.""*

* [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv_vLHiWVBh_FR9vbeuiY-A/featured) - A great history channel focused on ancient Rome & Greece.

* [History Time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9v4QG3AQEP3zuRvVs2dAg/featured) - A fantastic history channel that mostly covers Europe. Two thumbs up.

* [HistoryMarche](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MX9ECowgDMTOnFTE8EUJw/featured) - A newish channel, but boy is it going places. The videos are very well made, and very interesting. I recommend the two videos, Battle of Poitiers parts 1 and 2.

* [BazBattles](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-dJoP9hFCBloY9qodykvw) - Covers historical battles, tactics, politics, conflicts throughout history from Ancient Rome to XX century, served with smooth animated narration. I recommend his 1066 trilogy: The Battle of Fulford, The Battle of Stamford Bridge, and the Battle of Hastings.

* [Invicta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwO-UgquohXwoe7f0e6lMnw) - Definitely one of the best history channels. Very well made videos, that cover a wide range of civilizations and time periods from human history. Primarily produces 2 series, ""How They Did It"" and ""Moments in History. The Colors of history from epic to tragic episodes of our past.

* [Weird History](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA) - Exactly what it sounds like. Videos about really weird moments in human history. Go watch his videos ""Ten Cent Beer Night Was A Total Disaster"", or ""1908 Auto Race From New York to Paris Is An Unbelievable Story"". I promise you'll be hooked.

**Edit 2**

* **Dan Carlin's Hardcore History** - This is actually a podcast, but I thought it warranted recommendation since it's so good. Dan Carlin is an absolute legend, and I would rank this podcast even above the best history YouTube channel.

* **Stuff You Missed in History Class** - Is great too, and deserves a mention.

**EDIT 3**

* [The Great War](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcyEsEjhPEDf69RRVhRh4A) - I had forgotten about this one when I made this topic, or I would have had it on here too. This channel covers WW1 more in depth than any other channel or podcast around, following the events of the war week by week. The same people also have the equally good channel, [World War Two](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP1AejCL4DA7jYkZAELRhHQ/featured), that follows this war week by week as well. Both are very, very good channels.

**EDIT** Holy cow, thanks for the gold kind stranger!

**EDIT** Silver too? Thanks as bunch!

**EDIT** More gold and Silver? Thank you very much! I really hope you all enjoy the channels. Please have a good day!"

Six years later during the Crimean War he was a mate on the HMS Hecla when she was bombarding a Russian fort in modern-day Finland. 

""The fire was returned from the fort, and at the height of the action a live shell landed on Hecla's upper deck, with its fuse still hissing. All hands were ordered to fling themselves flat on the deck, but Lucas with great presence of mind ran forward and hurled the shell into the sea, where it exploded with a tremendous roar before it hit the water. Thanks to Lucas's action no one on board was killed or seriously wounded by the shell, and accordingly he was immediately promoted to lieutenant by his commanding officer.""

He was later awarded the Victoria Cross, was promoted to captain, and married the Hecla's captain's daughter. The couple had three daughters, but the medal was left on a train and lost.

For example we had fun discussing the Henry I succession crisis, and that takes up a sizable bit of wall. But only when I looked further I realised this was contemporaneous with Genghis Khan's early life, which from a world perspective is inarguably more important, and I nearly missed him altogether. I did the same with Avicenna. So who should I look out for, as we continue on with our project?

I learned a really cool story that I would like to share with you.

In 1939, the director of a Belgian uranium mine in the Congo (as it was still a Belgian colony), Edgar Sengier, learned about the military implications of weaponized uranium. Fearing what would happen if the uranium mine or stock fell into the wrong hands, he secretly shipped most of it to a warehouse in New York in 1940. Luckily for him as well, the Governor General of the Congo declared that on the day of Belgium's fall to Nazi Germany, the Belgian Congo would support the Allies, unlike most of the French colonies that aligned themselves with Vichy France.

Sengier moved to New York and was contacted by the U.S. military in 1942 to buy uranium for the Manhattan Project. He told them that ""You can have the ore now. It is in New York, a thousand tons of it. I was waiting for your visit.""

The U.S. Army also secured the remaining 3,000 tons left in the Shinkolobwe mine. The uranium from the Congo was much more plentiful and in much higher quality than the previous uranium being studied by U.S. scientists from North America, and much better and more plentiful than what Germany had access to in Europe.

He was the first non-American civilian to receive the U.S. Medal of Merit. Sengier was also made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Commander of the French Légion d'honneur, and Officer of the Order of Leopold and the Belgian Order of the Crown.

The agreement between the United States, Great Britain, and Belgium lasted 10 years and continued after the war. The uranium agreements in part explain Belgium's relative ease in rebuilding its economy after the war, as the country had no debt with the major financial powers.

I thought that was super interesting that one man very few people have probably heard of had such an enormous impact on history, and that the thousands of Congolese workers that died and toiled in the uranium mines could have never had any idea how much they were to change the course of world history, as before World War 2 uranium was primarily used in much more mundane industries like in glass coloring.

The book is Congo: An Epic History of a People if you're interested in 600 pages of African history. :)

Edit: 

So this is getting a lot more attention that I thought it would! I expected maybe five upvotes. To clarify a few things:

I didn't mean to necessarily characterize the Belgian presence in Congo as heroic in this story, as they did truly evil things in Africa. But I think that it's interesting that because of two Belgian colonial officials, instead of Congo joining the Axis powers, like many French colonies joined the Vichy government, they sided with the Allies and the world's largest and best supply of uranium went to the United States instead of Germany. Irrespective of people's opinions on nuclear weapons and their use in Japan, ultimately, keeping nuclear weapons away from Germany was a good thing, even if in other ways, Belgians were still oppressors of the Congolese people.

Additionally I think sub-Saharan Africa's involvement in World War 2 is an extremely undervalued and underrepresented topic. For example, Congolese involvement went well beyond just supplying uranium. Congolese soldiers also fought Italy in the Horn of Africa, fought with the Allies in Egypt, Palestine, and served as medics as far away as Burma. Congo also contributed a lot of material support to the Allied Powers. This is just one chapter of one country's history in Africa that ended up being really important in the long run for how the rest of world history unfolded. I wanted to point out how momentous events in history can be influenced in unexpected ways, like how the roles of the Congolese and Belgians in the Manhattan Project are probably unknown to most people, or at least surprising in their measure of importance."

My questions is why would they fly alone like this? Wouldn't it be much safer to fly in a formation, or at a very minimum have a fighter escort? It seems like a huge unnecessary risk having a slow and sluggish bomber carrying a brand new city-destroying bomb fly by itself over the Japanese mainland. 

And as a second question, why exactly were the two bombers able to safely fly into and out of Japanese airspace? Why weren't they intercepted or attacked by AA guns?

Thanks in advance!

[Some general descriptions about the situations in eastern Asia by that time](https://hst271.tdh.bergbuilds.domains/summary/summary-of-chapter-3/)

***Some quick background:***

*By the year of 1649, which was five years after the Manchus, a semi-nomadic tribe, descended from the seemingly unbreakable great wall and achieved their great feat of conquering Northern China, the authority conducted a census and found out by that time there were only 55330 adult males in the entire population. In the mean time, they have to deal with more than 100 millions subjugated Chinese. This sheer difference of numbers between the conqueror and the conquered forced practically every Manchus men to become soldiers, including the author of this diary.*

*The author acted sort of like a nowadays squad leader in the Manchus army, for he had 4 soldiers under his command. However, Since the Manchus army suffered from the above mentioned predicament of lacking manpower, he , as a born Manchus himself, actually enjoyed a very trusted position in the eyes of his general and could get in touch with some ultra confidential information/ high level officials every now and then.*

*The diary itself covered a period of roughly 3 years: from the New year's day of 1680 to 1682, and it mainly focused on the author's military career during the Manchus conquest of the southern China.  Although as you can probably tell from reading his work, the author himself was not exactly the most educated and bright guy on the earth and due to the nature of his job this diary's narration suffered badly from many huge gaps, it was a really unique and extremely valuable piece of historical source and eye-witness account.*

*I wish I could translate all of them but for now please enjoy the first five months of this diary that I have already translated!*

&#x200B;

In the reign of Elhetaifin khan(**the original text omitted this title here, yet the author did use Khan to address his monarch in the later part of the dairy. The Chinese word for Elhetaifin was Kang xi**), in year 19, the canary monkey year of the Manchu calendar.

The new year‘s day: General Manggitv(**this is apparently either a spelling mistake or a nickname, since this general's name was actually Manggitu as we can find from the later part of the diary and other history sources**) led his councilors,janggins (**a Manchu military title**)and local officials to the city of Nan ning fu **(The word fu already means city in Chinese , but the author,as a Manchu, clearly was unaware of it and he probably thought it is a part of the city’s name. So in the original text he wrote Nan ning fui hoton, in which hoton means city in Manchus,thus it could be translated as the city of Nan ning city).** They entered the Dung Yoo miyoo(**meaning the temple of eastern mountains in Chinese**) and made a dedication to the divine. The subordinates of the councillors prostrated themselves to each other to show their courtesy. By the time of the festival, the janggins of the eight banners and soldiers started to eat and drink, even those armoured bayaras(**one of the most elite Manchu military units**) went on the street, they got some women’s clothes and wore them themselves to pretend like women, and they sang along with those who were singing the song of Doo yang ke (**again, ke already means song in Chinese, and the author was not aware of that. I think making this kind of mistake twice probably suggests the author has no knowledge of the Chinese language.**)to entertain themselves. The image of the old men (**sakdasa in the original text, which probably refers to the author’s parents**) emerged in my heart, fuck.

25th,February: Shang zhi xin(**a Chinese dynast who serves the Manchus**), the mighty conqueror general, the king who pacified the south; along with Manggitu,the general of the south theatre; Ecu, the general of Jiangning; Lebei and Hife, the counsellor and lord of the banner; and Ehene, the vice janggin, met together to hold a war council on the best method to enter and conquer Yun nan(**a province in southwestern China**).The plan was made, and it was decided that we should initiate the invasion next winter. I fed my horse also fixed my saddle, tent and gears.

3rd,March: Mang(**this time for sure a nickname of general Manggitu, potentially coined by the author himself**) said there was a decree issued from the khan’s court…..(**the content of the decree was too long and rather irrelevant, so I did not translate it**). I took some time to finish the necessary maintenance.

5th,March: The date of departure was approaching, so an order was given to us to prepare our weapons.

6th,March: Ganduhai and other low-ranked janggins strictly inspected the quantity of the horses. The message of Ma qiyang yen’s rebellion against us was delivered to our camp again, he was the Chinese governor of Bin jeo.

13th,March: General Mang(**nickname of Manggitu**) selected 3 bayaras from each niru(**the manchu equivalent of battalion, roughly 300 men strong**), and he handled this force to Hife, the lord of the banner, and Ehene, the janggin of the flag(**apparently Mr Ehene got recently promoted**). Hife also had 5 regiments of Chinese auxiliary forces under his command, each of which was 1000 men strong . With this army, he was ordered to fight the above-mentioned rebel Ma Qiyang Yen, and he then marched towards the direction of Bin jeo.This day my eight horses(**the author forgot to use plural form and accusative case here,I assume it was due to his depression**)were stolen by thieves. My heart feels so heavy. After reporting this to the general, the general informed the officials and the civilians about this matter, and an investigation was initiated; it turned out to be fruitless.

16th,March: General Ecu reached Nanning city(**I assume the author was learning Chinese, since this time he did not say the city of Nanning city again**)from the county of Yung Mvn by water.

20th,March: The military horse from Yung Mvn also reached our camp. The general ordered to allocate these military horses from Yung mvn among those armored soldiers who did not have one. At that time **(the couriers)** did not want to surrender the horses, so **(the general)** scolded the leaders of every regiment, calling them weak. General Mang gathered all those janggins of the camps together and told them: ""Why have those horses not been allocated as ordered yet? You were ignoring my orders! It was not even something hard to do, yet you refused to follow it! Now, go and bring those horses to the city, they are government property! "" Then the matter was finally settled.

25th,March: We departed from Nanning city and I followed Mang the general and Lebei, Hife the lord of the banner, from each niru they took 4 soldiers with them, aiming to reach Liu zhou. We marched past the Jing ceng sy(**a Chinese temple**) and Kun lun pass.

In five days, we marched 170 ba(**a Manchu unit of length, each ba equals roughly 500 meters**)

30th,March: We reached Bin Jeo; first, we met the Bayara force; then, I and my squad were allocated to the ranks of the Aliha force(**it is a combined force of Mongol and Manchu soldiers.The word Aliha means ""those who are in charge""**).We then formed a new platoon.

1st,April: A servant of my platoon mate Hooxan distributed some beef among us. These beef meats were acquired through killing some random natives. This was discovered by the general’s own armoured guards. He called me and other squad leaders to his tent, then he asked us to sit down and comforted us with his kind words. I felt so ashamed. In the end, we were all punished, Ganduhai was sentenced to a fine of three months' salary, I and the vice janggin Dandai were sentenced to a fine of six months' salary. Bosoku (**a Manchu military title, refers to a low-ranking cavalry officer**) was sentenced to 70 strokes of the cane. Hooxan from the Booju niru,who was the master of the servant, was sentenced to 80 strokes of the cane. The servant was sentenced to 100 strokes of the cane.

4th, April: The rations of the army were running out, so the general decided to move the camp. We moved to a place that was 15 ba away from Bin Jeo. We were ordered to search for food in every nearby village and to hull rice plants if we could find any. I sent the children of my servant to the village,(**they**)discovered some rice plants hidden by the villagers in their basements, (**we**)dug a hole in the ground to hull the rice.

6th, April: The Chinese auxiliary force was ordered to build a temporary bridge on the river near Bin Jeo.

8th, April: A decree was issued by the ministry:""Prince kemungge and Brother king Shang zhi xin(**previously mentioned Chinese dynast who supports Manchu rule**) ,please(**the original text was,quite surprisingly, using operative mood**) meet together, then use your joint force to attack Ma qiyang yen’s force.General Manggitu, why have you not launched the campaign to enter and conquer Yun nan? You need to explain this to us immediately"" Then we heard again the rumour that Hai Qing county,Jin Men, and Xia Men of Fu Jian province were conquered by our empire.

13th,April: Once again, a scolding message was sent from the ministry, asking us to enter and conquer Yun nan.

16th,April:Since the servant of the soldier( **probably referring to the Hooxan incident**)harmed the local people, a decree that barred all soldiers from leaving their post was issued.

19th,April: We crossed the river near Bin jeo, marching 15 ba, and then we established our camp at a place called Too deng near Xa Moo San. I made a small shack for myself with grass. This day the brother king(**Shang zhi xin**) sent a letter to our camp:"" governor Jin **(a Chinese)** is leading the marine force and traveling by water with 23 boats. I myself am currently dwelling with military governor Jelken. We shall start to move with our force on April 15th. I pray that your excellency could capture Lai Bin County; in the mean time, I will go and capture Vsiowan County. I hope I can meet you at that place. I wish we could then discuss whether we should wait for Prince Kemungge or simply attack Liu zhou with our own force."" And the mighty baturu(**meaning great warrior**), the man born for war, the governor of Yun Gui, general Zhao liang dong( **a Chinese general who served in Manchu army, he was greatly respected by the author**)also sent a secret message to our camp: ""The leader of the rebels Wu san gui, Wu guo gui were now dead. The ones left were Wu ying qi, Wu Shi Fan, and Hu Gui Zhu. They were nothing but a bunch of incompetent dollards and their morale was already shattered. This is the time to conquer Szechuan! Four(**armies**)need to conduct attacks together, we shall capture all their land, and it will be done in one strike!"" I carefully and respectfully heard his message .

23th,April: The war council decided to capture Lai Bin first. Thus, an order to prepare a ration of one month’s worth was issued. I ordered someone to dig a hole in the ground to hull the rice plants.

28th,April: The soldiers were sent out to collect enemy intelligence. I also went out with them.

29th,April: I was sick, I puked.

1st, May: Prince Elhe himself was leading his army back to the north, it was said they were going back to Beijing, I went out to follow him, but contrary to my wish, I failed to go back, fucking frastrute(**author made a spelling mistake here, and it was followed by a large gap period, so he was probably super fed up**).

7th, May: The rebel leaders from Yun nan,namely Fan Qi Han and Jan Yang, joined forces with Ma Qiyang yen and crossed the river near Lai Bin. We heard that they stopped near the Da Xi Bridge. General Mang ordered all the men to stay within the camp and build fortifications. My troops also participated in building the defences, and they were all complaining.

13th, May: The hostile force was approaching, they stopped at a place 5 ba away from us and set up camp on a monticule. General mixed the Chinese auxiliary forces and our own forces together in order to defend the camp. I was personally patrolling the camp with my full-set of armour on for the entire day.

15th,May: Subordinates of the rebel Ma qiyang yen, fake general Ma qiyang lei, and Rao yi lung,together with the other rebel’s fake generals Fan qi han and Jan yang from Yun nan challenged us with more than 10 thousand soldiers. They arranged many anti-horse obstacles and large barriers near Too Deng. The army of the enemy itself was drawn up in a four-line formation and was equipped with many muskets and elephants. Seeing this, General Mang ordered every subcamp to select 1 janggin and 10 armoured soldiers to secure the luggage. Then the rest of the army went out to fight the enemy. Our army was marshalled as follows: ""Hife, the lord of the banner, stood at the front of the first line to coordinate the attack. The troops in the second line were commanded by Masita. The first line of the right wing, in the meantime, was commanded by Ehene. The flank troops of the left wing were commanded by Lebei. In front of the whole army, the general placed the Chinese auxiliary force and their artillery."" The enemy rushed towards us; they broke through our first line like it was nothing, and the Chinese could not stop the charging enemy, so they fled from the battle. Seeing this, the banner men from plain red and plain yellow organised two simultaneous attacks with great passion; they penetrated the enemy line, creating two gaps. Yet the enemies fought unyieldingly; they reorganised and concentrated all their forces to strike towards us, ignoring the plain red and yellow bannermen at their flank. Our troops could not stop them, so we started to retreat scatteredly. I saw it all myself, how they drove the bannermen from the bordered blue banner to their anti-horse obstacle. But all of a sudden, the bannermen being chased stopped, and a series of strange ""picyang"" sounds came from the enemy's direction. Then I saw the soldiers of the first line somehow managed to drive the elephants towards us while the military standards of the bordered yellow banner’s bayara janggin Valda and aliha army(**the unit author belonged to**)’s vice bosoku( **the bosoku himself was probably still recovering from the cane stroke**) Ulehi were seized by the enemy. At that time, the soldiers of the second line, including me, saw hardly any option but to shoot desperately towards those beasts. They were charging us from all directions, so we had to shoot while standing back to back, and we shot arrows that looked like hedgehog‘s spikes. When the elephants got shot, they fled away. My heart felt really strange at that instance, and I could not stop it from beating like crazy. The hostile army then left the plain and retreated to the forest on the mountains. They again arranged some anti-horse obstacles there later that day. We did not fight them again, for our forces went back to the camp to spend the night while defending our fortifications.

Granted I was young, I was aware of what was being said about the president when I was 5-9 years old and what I remember was that President Carter was really berated a lot.  There are times when I was 5-6  years old and the Billy Beer thing was always being joked about and then, more seriously, I remember the Iran Hostage crisis and the heaps of criticism piled on Carter.

The thing is, in my adult life, former President Carter has been an absolute boss.  He has successfully negotiated the release of hostages in hostile foreign lands and he is a strong, if not the strongest, proponent for helping third world countries when disaster strikes.

Why was he so persecuted in the press and in most homes back in the late 70's when he is now the most active and effective (not even arguably) ex-president for foreign affairs after leaving office?

The belt is 6-feet long and contains ten thousand beads. It depicts a house in the middle, representing the Six Nations. The Mohawk are the keepers of the eastern door and the Seneca the keepers of the western door. They are holding hands with 13 others, representing the 13 United States. (The historian I'm currently reading as well as the Onondaga website say they represent 13 states, but Kentucky and Vermont were already admitted to the union)

The wampum symbolizes friendship with the Six Nations Iroquois and is a visual representation of the Treaty of Canandaigua. This treaty is commemorated annually on November 11, where U.S. officials distribute cloth to fulfill the terms of the treaty.

(This is very random, but I just learned about this today, so I thought I'd share)

For example, the British seemed to be overwhelmed and surprised by the guerilla tactics of colonial militias, but it seems so obvious marching at one another was very ineffective. The best explanation I could think of was to make war civilized, but it still seems as a very ineffective way of conducting war by both sides. "

This is a recording of the final minute of war and beginning of peace. This was recorded near the River Moselle in the American front. It's really eerie to think that the guns were firing until the very last second but, what really moved me is when the guns go silent and you can hear a bird sing. This is a truly a fantastic audio clip.

You can listen to it [here](https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/07/eerie-recording-reveals-moment-the-guns-fell-silent-at-the-end-of-ww1-8114109/?ito=social&fbclid=IwAR38WhTeA2ydCwtxbkjpteZxu7x5w45LzhmYlT_G2Fd596-QHznf1R8JBQY).

EDIT: Yes, I should look for more sources when reading stuff like this. The image that we see with the video is actually real, it is part of a technique that was used to locate enemy artillery in the battlefield ([Sound ranging explained](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/sound-ranging-explained)). The Imperial War Museum joined efforts with Coda to Coda sound designers to use that data and recreate what the end of the war sounded.

As are the next generation of badasses like Jess Cramp, the most incredible shark conservationist- check out her last expedition it was incredible @jessaddwater 2- Check out my last expedition (2 months ago) to the BREATHTAKING isolated island of Socotra - it took us 3 days on a cockroach infested cement cargo ship through pirate waters to get there and it was completely worth it. Flick back through my instagram feed but especially through my team mates Leon McCarron and Martin Edstrom's feeds and insta-stories. Those guys know how to take pics!

Catch me in a cave, a library, on TV, on stage and for a limited time only on REDDIT. 

Questions about exploration, caves, Neanderthals, unstable places, how important exploration and science is in unstable places, neocolonialism, English weather, women in exploration and comedy are especially welcome. Also, any statements about how Hershey’s isn't chocolate will be especially welcome by this English girl.

-Martin Niemöller

This was Martin Niemöller's poetic confession of his guilt for letting the rise of the Nazis plague his Nation. He was referring to the purging of different groups by the Nazis and how many people (including him) reacted to it.
It says alot about how cowardice the normal person is, many say they would try and do something to stop the nazis from gaining power, but a closer examination will show that many people will do nothing until it's their turn to be persecuted.
This is my favorite quote, because it's a honest interpretation about how the regular person thinks and acts in this kind of situation.

EDIT: I fixed the quote. ""First they came for the Communists
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a Communist"" is actually the first part of the quote but the United States made them take it out in the 50s due to the cold war, sorry I hope this doesn't change the great conversations we're having.

I would like to say, these are great discussions y'all are having in the comments. here is a link to the article I got most of my information on.

The problem with this is that it was often obvious that is what they had done, and as a result they were either court-martialed or treated as a coward.

I also heard a few instances of German soldiers at Stalingrad drawing straws with their friends and the person who got the short straw won, and his prize was that one of his friends would stand some distance away from him and shoot him in the shoulder so he had a wound bad enough to be evacuated back to Germany while the wound also looking like it was caused by enemy action.

My question is say you are a soldier in WW1 or WW2. What is the best possible injury you could hope for that would

a. Get you off the front lines for an extended period of time

b. It not being an injury that would greatly affect the rest of your life

c. not an injury where anyone can accuse you of being a coward or think that you did the injury deliberately in order to get off the front?

Also, this is not just about potential injuries that are inflicted on a person in general combat, but also potential injuries that a soldier could do to himself that would get him off the front lines without it looking like he had deliberately done it.

and also, just while we are on the topic, to what extremes did soldiers go through to get themselves off the front lines, and how well did these extremes work?"

The colonies of the Americas gained independence from their colonial masters around a similar time span. The entire western hemisphere is rich in resources and there was plenty of room for growth at independence. 

Yet it was North America that emerged as the most economically prosperous of the two continents. Obviously the US and Canada have traditionally been the most developed countries in North America but Mexico and even a number of Central American countries are solidly middle income or higher. Meanwhile the South American countries range economically from middle income like Brazil and Argentina, to high middle income like Chile, to low income like Bolivia. I once read a joke that Brazil is the ""eternal nation of tomorrow"" meaning its potential for greatness has always been strong, but it never can quite reach that point. Granted some countries like Colombia and Peru are showing improvements today, yet that economic gap between the two continents remains.

How did this gap happen? Why didn't the countries of South America grow economically at a pace similar to that of the North American ones? What did South American nations do wrong that prevented progress in their early history onward?"

First of all, let's clarify what I mean when I say ""True Damascus Steel"", because it is very easy to become mired in definitions and ambiguity.

[Top: Ottoman Pala, Pattern welded. Bottom, Iranian Shamshir, Crucible steel.](https://preview.redd.it/oj7m6y0k3e591.jpg?width=6733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be106e56821267c4dfb0c9c1707143f878f62c87)

**""Damascus steel"" usually refers to two main types of steel**:

The most common you'll see made today is ""**pattern-welded steel**"", where alternating layers of nickel rich and nickel deplete steel are stacked, forge welded, and **folded** or manipulated to create a pattern. The blade is then polished and etched to reveal the layers. While modern pattern welded blades typically use nickel containing steels to maximise contrast, historically this was not the case.

This method of construction using stacked, folded or otherwise forge welded, dissimilar* steels is how the majority of sword steels were made, worldwide, until advances in technology allowed for the use of more homogenous steel products. Pattern welding, and variants such as multibar patterns and laminated blades, were used widely and includes swords like spatha, “viking” swords, katana and more. It is worth noting that even ""monosteel"" swords which were made without the use of dissimilar steel, but still made from bloomery or refined blast furnace steel, were also subject to similar stacking, folding and forge welding techniques.

*Bloom is here considered to contain multiple dissimilar steels due to the heterogeneous nature of bloom. 

This description of pattern welding and forge consolidated steels is intentionally simplified as they are not the focus of todays post, however for more information - particularly on bloomery and blast furnace production of steels - I recommend ""The Knight and the Blast Furnace"" by Alan Williams.

In the present day, this is the type you will see chef’s knives, swords, and even pocket knives being made of, and it can range from being rather cheap to incredibly expensive depending on the materials and workmanship.

[Pattern welded Pala blade in \\""Turkish Ribbon Twist\\"" style.](https://preview.redd.it/ijgu7seo3e591.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=630b2d095047fcd34d73f1e37c87db156a4f195a)

The other type of ""Damascus Steel"" is a form of hypereutectoid, pattern forming **crucible steel.**

And that is what I will be discussing today.

It is a hypereutectoid steel, which means that it has over 0.8% carbon by definition. It is formed by liquifying steel in a crucible, and is **NOT** **produced by folding** or layering steel. The typical composition is around 1% to 2% carbon, which by modern standards makes this an “ultra-high carbon steel”, often abbreviated as UHCS.

It is formed by melting steel with specific impurities in a crucible (historically, made of high kaolin content clay, rice husks as chaff, quartz sands, and other additives), and the process of turning this crucible “charge” into steel is quite complicated, with the potential for failure to produce an attractive pattern being high if any part of the process is not conducted correctly.

In summary, the crucible charge is brought up to melting temperature, and held at this temperature for a while, allowing the constituent alloying elements present in the steel to spread and bubbles to boil out. It is then slowly cooled, before the ingot is removed, roasted to decarburise the rim, drawn out into a bar, manipulated to produce a surface pattern with ball peens, wedges and grinding, and finally forged it into a blade, and thermally cycled.

As stated, this steel is typically the range of carbon content is between 1 and 2% in historical examples, and thus melts in a temperature range between 1200 and 1400c (for more information, see “iron carbon phase diagrams”). It must also have sufficient levels of carbide formers (vanadium, molybdenum, manganese etc) in order to form patterns (Verhoeven et al, 1998,. Verhoeven et al 2018).

The pattern in crucible steel are formed by ""rafts"" of steel rich in carbide formers, where ultra-hard cementite spheroids form over subsequent forging cycles, which etch bright, and areas devoid of carbide forming elements (CFEs), which remain as pearlite, a soft mix of carbides which etches dark. The shape and size of the rafts is determined by the length of dendrites that form during the slow cooling of the ingot, as dendritic regions of the steel are carbide former depleted, and interdendritic regions are carbide former rich (Verhoeven et al, 2018).

[Crucible steel shamshir blade, kara Khorasan pulad](https://preview.redd.it/rbchxn5t3e591.png?width=8091&format=png&auto=webp&s=6081374d34827d01a9493c3673aeddc09372cbb0)

Many people conflate pattern-welded steel with crucible steel, and call both “Damascus”. Whilst this is accepted in colloquial language, it is important to distinguish between the two – particularly when it comes to identifying antiques, or documenting them.

""Damascus"" can therefore be used to refer to either pattern welded, or crucible steels, as both are pattern-forming steels, but it is best to specify which sort of ""Damascus"" is being discussed. The term has been used historically to describe both pattern-welded steel and crucible steel. Many swords and gun barrels made in germany were marked ""damastahl"" in the 18th and 19th century, and they were pattern welded, so there is historical precedent for such a naming convention, but the two techniques (and end products) are very different.

**To be ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: ""True"" damascus steel is herein used as a term to refer to historical, patterned crucible steel. I am using this term entirely because it is understandable. The correct naming and etymology is discussed later. Both pattern welded and crucible steel blades can be called ""damascus"", and were historically, but the ""lost"" form is the crucible steel form.**

**The Myth: ""Damascus Steel is a Lost Art"":**

The is quite a long history of crucible “Damascus” steel, in the form of primary sources in which the process was written down - as early as 350BCE - 420BCE Zosimus, an early alchemist in Alexandria, wrote the following:

>""The tempering of Indian Iron: Take 4 pounds of soft iron, and the skins of myrobalans, called elileg, 15 parts; belileg, 4 parts; and two parts of glassmakers magnesia. Then place it into a crucible and make it level. .... Put on the charcoal and blow the fire until the iron becomes molten and the ingredients become united with it. ... Such is the premier and royal operation, which is practiced today and by means of which they make marvelous swords. It was discovered by the Indians and exploited by the Persians"".

This is by no means the only method to make crucible steel - some was co-fusion, using both cast iron and bloom, while some was indeed made with bloomery and carbon bearing material (often plants).

Incidentally, the oldest known crucible steel sword is from the 6th to 3rd century BCE and was found interred in a megalithic site in Thelunganur, Tamil Nadu, India (Ramesh et al, 2019) and daggers from \~500BCE have been found with the associated production site in Kodumanal, Tamil Nadu (Sasisekaran & Rao, 1999. Sasisekaran, 2002). This is consistent with the Zosimus account describing the technique as discovered by India.

[Thelunganur sword, Ramesh et al 2019](https://preview.redd.it/cfthvr2f4e591.jpg?width=2128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8141215372f59d840de48a1f9237b31689535a4)

The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi - circa 800CE - 873CE) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni - circa 973CE - 1048CE) both wrote detailed procedures for the production of crucible steel, too.

⁠This is how Biruni described it in the manuscript Al-Jamâhir Marefat al-Jawâher. (From Khorasani et al, 2013):

>“He says that they \[ironwokers\] include five ratl رطل of \[horse\] shoes, the nails of which are made of narmâhan نرمآهن\] in the crucible\]. Then they add ten derham درهم of each \[of the ingredients\] rusaxtaj روسختج\] antimony\], marqiša-ye talâ’i طلائى مرقيشا\] golden marcasite\] and meqnesiyâ مغنسيا\] meqnisiyâ مغنيسيا ;manganese dioxide MnO2\] to the crucible, close the crucible with clay, and put it in the furnace. Then they fill the furnace with charcoal and blow air with Rumi (Roman Byzantine/Anatolian) bellows that are pumped by two men until the iron melts. Then they add a combination of halile هليله) myrobalan), pust-e anâr انار پوست) pomegranate peel), melh al-ajeyn ملحالعجين) the salt used for dough), and sadaf-e morvarid مرواريد صدف) pearl shell). From each the same amount approaching forty derham درهم are placed into small bags. One small bag is then added to each crucible. They keep heating vigorously without pause for one hour and then stop the heat. After it cools off, they take out the iron ingot (egg) from the crucibles. A person said that he was sitting next to a smith who was making swords in the province of Send سند\] Sind\]. He saw that the smith was using narmâhan نرمآهن and putting a very soft, ground mixture, which had a red color on it. Then the smith placed it in the furnace, and took it out and hammered it, and continued this process a couple of times. When asked why he did that he looked contemptuously. When he \[the person sitting next to the smith\] looked closely, he saw that the smith was hammering and mixing dus دوص with narmâhan نرمآهن the same way they made iron ingots (eggs) in Herat.”

The metallurgical research into how this steel gets its patterns spans back far, with Michael Faraday (yes, that Faraday) having published a paper on recreating Indian crucible steel (known to him as wootz) in 1819, with subsequent papers in 1820 and 1822. It wasn't until 1837 when Pavel Anasov, a Russian metallurgist and director of the Zlatoust arms factory, that it was successfully recreated in any substantial quantity. Since then, research has been done on modern steels (Sherby and Wadsworth, 1983) and on historical blades, revealing the mechanisms by which the patterns forms (Verhoeven et al, 1998).

Anosov was a metallurgist and Colonel of the Russian Army during the occupation on the Emirate of Bukhara in the 1820’s, when he established contact with steelmakers in the region and attempted to recreate the steel in his steelworks in Zlatoust, but after failing asked Captain Massalski (results published 1841) whose regiment was stationed there, to observe the process and undertake further observations.

Massalski documented the Bukhara method, noting 3 key metals, cast iron, iron, and silver. Massalski stresses the ratio of one part iron, 3 parts cast iron (N.B: a co-fusion method of making steel with the right amount of carbon) and the crucibles hold around 2.5kg of steel, making up 1/3rd of the potential capacity of the crucible.

The metal workers start the fire and the metal begins to melt after some 5 to 6 hours, and makes a bubbling sound. When the bubbling sound ends, this is a sign that the fusion has ended. The workers remove the lid, add 0.013kg to 0.017kg of silver, stir rapidly with an iron rod, cover the charge with charcoal, and cover again with the lid. (N.B: this was a potentially primitive form of ""killing"" the steel, a process by which reactive elements in the charge react with another reactive metal - silver in this case, aluminium in modern times - and are thus removed from the reaction, resulting in less porosity due to gas production. The other method of degassing historically used was simply holding the ingot at the molten, liquidus temperature for longer). 

* N.B: Silver is not particularly reactive, so the purpose of silver might not have been killing the steel. The atmosphere and composition of a crucible melt, as well as the 1400-1500c temperature at which silver was added require further investigation to determine the mode of action. it may be that the liquid silver was moving into the grain boundaries of the steel during solidification, displacing phosphorus or sulphur.

They return the crucible to the fire and allow it to cool as the charcoal burns out, slowly, over 3 days. After cooling, the ingot is removed and tested by polishing to check for dendrites. The steel then passes to smiths, who “know that from then onwards whether the ingot survives being forged is a matter of luck”

[A freshly made crucible steel ingot, image credit Peter Burt](https://preview.redd.it/zkm0z19a4e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c39855adc912f208268efe017e54de3cc3f55ae)

This is clear evidence that not only was the crucible steel production process being conducted in Bukhara in 1841, but that the mechanisms of pattern formation were already being formally investigated. And this is by far not the most recent ethnographic account of crucible steel manufacture.

In Mawalgaha, Sri Lanka, Ananda Coomaraswamy documented crucible steel production in 1903 – (Coomaraswamy, A. (1908): Medieval Sinhalese Art. Pantheon Books, New York, Juleff et al 2009). He found two crucible ingot fragments, crucibles, iron blooms and small iron bars. The two crucible ingot fragments were collected from the Mawalgaha village, where Kiri Ukkuwa demonstrated how to make steel for Coomaraswamy – providing the most recent known eyewitness evidence for crucible steel manufacturing.

This form of ""Damascus"" steel was therefore historically used as early as the 6th century BCE (Park et al 2019) and as late as 1841 when Massalski recorded crucible steel production in Bukhara, leading to the production of Bulat in Zlatoust by Anosov, and 1903 in Sri Lanka (though it was not actively being made en masse, and was only demonstrated using previously abandoned equipment).

**In summary: Production between 1903ish, and 1980ish, was virtually halted, thus leading to the myth of it being a ""lost art"", however as will be shown in this document, the process was well documented and has since been replicated.**

The result is that there are now upwards of 150 individuals (at least, that I know of) who can produce crucible steel with an accurate metallurgical composition, which naturally form patterns in the steel due to carbide segregation. It is structurally, functionally and visually identical to historical crucible steel - and can only be differentiated by analysing the amount of radionuclides in the steel, as all historical steel is low background steel, and modern recreations are typically not.

Because I recognise that metallurgy is easier to grasp with visual aides, here is a comparison of antique crucible steel from an Iranian shamshir in my collection, and modern crucible steel (made by Niko Hynninen).

**Etymological information on ""Damascus"" steel:**

Utsa / Wootz (Sanskrit- and mistranslated Sanskrit), Urukku (Tamil) Pulad (Persian), Fuladh (Arabic), Bulat (Russian), Polat (Turkish) and Bintie (Chinese) are all names for ultra-high carbon crucible steel typified by carbide segregation, which can be otherwise referred to as ""crucible damascus steel"". The modern term “wootz” first appears around 1794 in writings by Sir Joseph Banks, who mistranslated Sanskrit for “utsa” as “wootz” (Dube, 2014). In the regions where crucible steel was made, and where it was forged into blades, it was not called ""damascus"". This name is primarily a medieval name, and primarily used in Europe.

The origin of the name ""Damascus"" steel is contentious - The Islamic writers al-Kindi (full name Abu Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi) (circa 800 AD - 873 AD) and al-Beruni (full name Abu al-Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni) (circa 973 AD - 1048 AD) were both scholars who wrote about swords and steel made for swords, based on their surface appearance, geographical location of production or forging, or the name of the smith.

There are three potential sources for the term ""Damascus"" in the context of steel.

The word ""Damas"" stems from the root word for ""water"" (""ma"") or ""broiling"" in Arabic (Sachse, 1994, 13) and Damascus blades are often described as exhibiting a water-pattern on their surface, and are referred to as ""watered steel"" not only in English but in other languages.

The second theory is geographical, as Al-Kindi called swords produced and forged in Damascus as Damascene (al-Hassan, 1978, 35) but it's worth noting that crucibl steel blades were made in many nations, and crucible steel is not known to have ever been produced in the city of Damascus. Al Kindi also describes crucible steel production using the typical term Pulad, distinct from these damascene swords, indicating that the two types are separate. It is also worth noting that Al-Kindi did not describe these swords as having pattern forming steel.

Third, Beiruni mentions a sword-smith called Damasqui who made swords of crucible steel (Said, 1989, 219-220). In a similar fashion, Al-Kindi mentions swords called “Zaydiya which were forged by a man called Zayd, and hence they were attributed to his name"". We therefore have a precedent for naming swords based on their makers, which may explain how ""Damascus"" came about.

It is my opinion that the ""watered"" hypothesis is most likely for the origin, though the popularisation of the term may have indeed occurred due to western travellers who purchased the swords in damascus, and described them thusly, as it was a massive center for trade.

**How Crucible steel gets its pattern:**

Crucible steel, as the name implies, is made in a crucible process, and requires completely liquefication of the crucible charge.

Most surviving ""recipes"" for crucible steel call for either a combination of bloomery iron, and cast iron, or the use of bloomery iron and organic carbon sources (like plant leaves) - but crucible steel recipes included other elements, like organic material - rice husks, leaves, bark - as well as shells, glass, and even silver. The trace impurities in the iron used, and in these additives, are key to the patterns they show after forging.

In order to form patterns, carbide forming alloying elements like vanadium, tungsten or manganese are necessary in small amounts, with vanadium being the most common historical alloying element. These carbide formers cause the segregation of hard cementite carbides, which form the ""white streaks"" in crucible steel.

The segregation of CFEs into interdendritic reasons is due to the differences in solidification temperature between high CFE and low CFE steel, with low CFE steel solidifying at a higher temperature than high CFE steel. This causes the low CFE steel to solidify first when the ingot is slowly cooled, and it does so by branching out into dendrities of relatively pure iron, while the impurities such as phosphorus, CFEs and sulfur get pushed into the regions between these branches.

[Dendritic structures visible on freshly made crucible ingot - image credit Peter Burt.](https://preview.redd.it/4plho3o14e591.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5862b44b804955becc1428e59c7f6ad289ddfc0d)

During the forging of the crucible steel ""puck"", these carbide formers are pushed into parallel, layered sheets in the microstructure of the steel (Verhoeven et al, 1998).

[Parallel cluster sheets.](https://i.redd.it/gi70lojz3e591.gif)

Because vanadium and other CFEs do not readily dissolve at forging temperatures and do not rapidly migrate at forging temperatures, these sheets of carbide formers form distinct bands in the steel. As the steel is thermally cycled, carbides aggregate onto the CFEs via ostwald ripening, and form spheroids of cementite. The interdendritic regions without CFEs form as pearlite, a soft two-phase mixture of carbides, or sorbite, and imperfect form of pearlite. This is diagnostic of historical crucible steel (Verhoeven et al 2018, Feuerbach 2002, Feuerbach 2006).

It is worth noting that vanadium is not the only effective carbide former found in historical crucible steel blades, and other carbide formers like manganese are seen in historical examples - or even chromium as seen in Chahak, Iran (Alipour et al 2021). Additionally, the other microalloying elements in the steel can effect the contrast and spacing of the pattern, with phosporus notably increasing the contrast of the pattern after etching (Khorasani and Hynninen, 2013)

**Historical perspectives on Crucible Damascus Steel quality:**

Regarding the historical reputation of historical crucible steel swords: they were always very expensive, very desirable, and very well thought of - HOWEVER - there are accounts from the 14th century of cold-short blades (high in phosphorus) which claims that crucible steel swords are prone to breakage in cold weather.

The exact quote is by Alī ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn Hudhayl, translated:

>""the Hindy sabre often breaks when the weather is cold and shows itself better when the weather is warm”

Despite this, they were very valued. Mohammad ibn Abi al-Barakāt Jŏhari Nezāmi in 1196 CE states a good shamshir blade of crucible steel was valued at 100 golden Dinar (Khorasani et al, 2013).

Al-Idrisi (Full name Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Idris al-Idrisi - circa 1100CE - 1166CE) claimed that ""*nothing could surpass*"" the edge of a crucible steel sword.

Bertrandon de la Brocquiere, a Frenchman, wrote about his travels to the Middle East in 1432CE–1433CE. He wrote:

>""Damascus blades are the handsomest and best of all Syria... I have nowhere seen swords cut so excellently. They are made at Damascus, and in the adjoining country.""

Note: This is potentially the source of the (incorrect but often repeated) claim that crucible steel swords were made in Damascus.

In the early 1600's, Polish king Zygmunt III Waza ordered a Armenian merchant (Sefer Muratowicz) to purchase a number of watered steel blades from Isfahan, Persia due to their value and reputation (Muratovich et al, 1777). On this same journey, the merchant purchased carpets embroidered with the royal coat of arms, which still survive today.

Regardless of the reputation crucible steel enjoyed in its' day, the reality is that it was by nature very clean, with minimal slag - which made it less likely to break due to inclusions - and there is a lot of variation in the metallurgical composition of this steel. Some have higher carbon, or more phosphorus, and the quality varied. Heat treatment also widely varied.

Compared to bloomery steel which was folded and consolidated, it's more uniform and much lower in slag - the term for non-metallic inclusions. The same is true of refined blast furnace steel, which also requires forge consolidation after finishing the finery process.

[Microstructure of a Japanese Katana, 2% Nital etch. Note the presence slag inclusions (black) within the mostly martensitic steel. Image credit George Vander Voort](https://preview.redd.it/za28tvn36e591.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb54d2c5b8b2d6c6265e426cb87cce2c637a83e)

&#x200B;

Crucible steel can be more brittle, depending on the heat treatment, phosphorus, and sulfur contents, or it can be much more flexible. It depends on the exact sword being analysed, as crucible steel was produced for around 2 millennia and in many places. For example, some accounts of crucible steel swords being able to be bent 90 degrees exist, however these can easily be countered with extant examples that take a set no matter the degree of bending.

**Production methods:**

Here are 4 different processes, which were recorded from at early as Al Kindi, to as late as 1841CE with Massalski - from the Deccani process used in Hyderabad, to the south Indian process, and the Isfahan process, and the Bukhara process.

There are more processes out there, I just haven't gotten around to writing them out.

**Bukhara:**

>3 parts clean iron, 1 part cast iron. Place in a crucible that is five times as tall as it the base is wide, with a mouth three times the size of the base. The weight of iron should be 2-2.5kg.  
>  
>Using a charcoal melting furnace with air venting holes, heat until melted (6 hours) or until a bubbling sound can be heard from the crucible. once bubbling stops, remove the lid of the crucible and add 0.013-0.017 grams of silver to the crucible and stir with a metal rod. reseal the crucible, seal all holes in the furnace, and allow to cool over 3 days.  
>  
>Remove the puck from the crucible, and polish one corner of it to check if the watered pattern is good. If the pattern is poor, reheat to a red heat and hold for seven minutes before allowing to cool in air.  
>  
>Forge into a bar using the top of the button to form the spine of the blade, and never heating above red.

**South Indian:**

>In a clay crucible of conical form (200mm height x 50mm diameter) add 250-500 grams of bloomery iron, as well as wood chips, rice husks, vines or leaves. Seal the crucible with a clay lid, leaving a vent hole. Allow to fully dry  
>  
>Using a bellow-fed charcoal forge, heat for 6 hours or until molten. allow the crucible to cool in the forge (some sources say to quench it in water).  
>  
>The button will have a striated appearance if everything was done correctly.

**Deccani (Hyderabad) Process:**

>Using a mixture of iron sand derived iron ore, and iron clay derived iron (mirtpalli and kondapur iron), place in a crucible with glass, sealed with clay with a vent hole. Place in a bellow powered charcoal furnace for 24 hours. The steel will melt within the first 3. After 24 hours, remove crucible and allow to cool in the air.  
>  
>Once cool, remove the buttons and cover each in clay, and anneal in a conventional forge for 12-16 hours. repeat this annealing process until the button is no longer brittle.

**Isfahan Process:**

>To a crucible, add 10% casi auriculata wood, and asclepias gigantean leaves with two parts pure iron, one part cast iron, and three parts silicate-rich iron ore up to a total weight of 200 grams.  
>  
>10-1200 of these small crucibles are heated at a time in a kiln operated with charcoal and bellows for 6 days, before the crucibles are broken open, and the buttons removed.  
>  
>The buttons are then transferred into a ""hot room"" to anneal and temper for 2 days so they do not shatter from cooling too quickly.

Authors note: I suspect that if this room is a furnace-heated compartment, and is hot enough, they also experience some level of rim decarburisation, as well as converting the microstructure of the puck to a more forgeable state compared to steel which has not been roasted.

**N.B:** A brief note on the claim **carbon nanotubes** exist in crucible steel:

The only articles that ""found"" carbon nanotubes was published as a brief communication to Nature, i.e not a full article. This was in 2006, and was only a few pages in length.

It later found its away into a conference paper by the same authors, still not a full length peer reviewed research article. This was 2 pages in length. These findings should be considered preliminary.

The method used (dissolving crucible steel in acid and seeing what remains) revealed stands of carbon, but carbon dissolves VERY readily into steel. Crucible steel is typified by cementite spheroids, which often stretch into rods during forging as they are deformed. If you dissolve cementite in acid, removing the iron component, you are left with carbon.

This does not mean there was an intact carbon nanotube in the core of the cementite rod - and even if it DID mean that, it would have negligible impact on performance because it is \*encased\* in cementite, which itself is in a soft matrix of pearlite or sorbite.

But don't take my word for it. Other academics, including those who have been instrumental in understanding crucible steel (namely John Verhoeven) doubt the findings.

"" John Verhoeven, of Iowa State University in Ames, suggests Paufler is seeing something else. Cementite can itself exist as rods, he notes, so there might not be any carbon nanotubes in the rod-like structure.""

""Another potential problem is that TEM equipment sometimes contains nanotubes, says physicist Alex Zettl of the University of California""

So I was reading Orlando Figes a few weeks ago and was absolutely disturbed by a piece he wrote on sex and virginity in the peasant/serf towns of rural Russia. Generally, a newly wed virgin and her husband would take part in a deflowering ceremony in front of the entire village and how, if the man could not perform, the eldest in the village would take over. Cultural behaviours like these continued into the 20th century in some places and, alongside his section on peasant torture and execution methods, left me morbidly curious to find out more.

I would like to know of any fascinating sexual rituals, domestic/married behaviours towards sex, sexual tortures, attitudes toward polygamy, virginity, etc, throughout all history and all cultures both remote and widespread to better understand the varied 'history of sex'"

Dear Dad & Mom
	You will probably have started down or have decide not to come when this letter gets home. Even though I suggested that you didn’t come I kinda hope you’re coming. I know you must be planning on it. I have hotel reservations made and either way you decide things will work out alright. I can’t hardly wait for this next week to pass till I can see you. I had to send that night letter through to let you know conditions here. The graduation will consist of having our names read, walking up & receiving our wings and commission papers. Taxis are supposed to be forbidden to come to the field, and the only busses running are G.d. busses for service men. So as much as I’d love to have you come it would be a pretty tiring and rough deal.  I’m so undecided as to which would be best that I don’t know what to suggest. I got your air-mail letter after I wired. Write again and let me know what you finally decide. 
	I’ve made plans for either way so I can see you almost as soon if you decide not to come. I have a reservation on braniff and united airlines to get to Salt Lake on Wed. 9th and if some priority puts me off I still have an alternate. I can get a B-34 to Denver and will be quite sure of getting a B-17 the same day from the Lowry field to salt lake. I’ll be seeing you soon.
Lots of love, Ralph

P.S I got your wire Dad. I think it will be best that way I’ll do my best to be in Salt Lake Wed. I’ll wire and let you know Monday or Tuesday.
P.P.S I met a very lovely girl at church Sunday. She is from the BYU and a resident of Houston. Last Sunday was the first chance I’ve had to go to church here. I met 5 old Y students and knew most of them. Some swell folks from ? and Idaho. One girl that was in some of my classes is a missionary here. I almost like seeing someone from home.

Dear Charles Campbell:
	Have a minute between “jobs” and want so much to again tell you how truly beautiful your song was on Sunday morning. Whatever your own thought is regarding your voice and its production accept the fact that it is unusually beautiful as to quality. – A very special gift to you – and from you. I’ve heard “the holy city” sung numerous times but rarely with your particular understanding and beauty. Please believe me- it’s just an innate something that eludes verbal expression. A spiritual quality so rarely found in “professional” singers. Please don’t ever lose it. 
	You will find opportunities to sing come your way, if at all possible accept them and let your voice ring out in the songs you love to sing – there will always be some receptive souls in your audiences who will be happier because they heard you – and the message out bring in this way. There are plenty of boogie-woogie artists, etc. abroad in the world and in the service but too few of you type. So – “do your stuff”
	I’m taking the liberty of enclosing two little leaflets which helped me so much. Trust you will find them interesting too. 
	On your journey through this particular phase of your life – in an activity which I’m sure none of us would chose – but which we find ourselves in – probably for excellent reasons – I know for you that “the light of god surrounds you; the love of god enfolds you; the power of god protects you’ the presence of god watches over you and keeps you safe and secure.”
					Cordially, Alice N. ?
P.S hope all your wishes come true & you’re sent where you want to go!



Dear Mom & Dad,
	I’ve been pretty busy for the last few days. I’ve never walked so far in my life. Our BOQ is down on a nice little lake about a mile and a half from the line and the Tech. training buildings. Our schedule is pretty well filled up too. 
	I really believe I’m going to like heavy bomb. We’re already started flying and a B-24 is really a good ship. I had three propellers feathered today and was holding my altitude with only one engine turning over. Anyone who tells you a 24 can’t fly on one engine is wrong. I met art Hubermenth? on the street the other night. It was surely swell to see him. He hasn’t changed a bit. If I can I usually get away from the field Sunday I’m going in and go to church with him. Dad, to be really honest with you and me too a car wouldn’t be the most practical thing to get right now. A person almost needs one to get around in and a lot of the fellows have them but the fact remains that I’ll be going over in about 5 months and a week from today; unless they make an instructor out of me here which I doubt. What would you advise me to do Dad? I looked at a lot of cars and about the best deals are 40’ fords & Chevy’s at $1000 & one 40 DeSoto good shape, tires, and accessories, at $1100 with a down payment of $500 and 15 months at about $46.78 per month. Costing about $110 to finance for 15 months. Please write or wire and let me know what you think I ought to plan on. There is a big possibility that I’ll go to Salt Lake from here. There or Fresno Calif. Write soon and tell me what to do
Love, Ralph.



Dear Mom & Dad,
	I’m sorry I don’t write more often to let you know what I am doing and how I am. You can bet I’m in no mischief though, I’m kept much too busy for anything like that. So far I’m getting along OK I guess. The B-24’s are really good ships and I think I’m going to learn to really like them. There is so much to one them though that you can’t appreciate until you learn all about what makes it tick. Would you believe it there is some 28 electrical motors alone on one of these ships. Just to learn all about them and their functions is quite a ?toll
	I guess I won’t fly for a day or two. I hurt my thumb pretty bad. The doctor x-rayed it and found it wasn’t broken so that’s good. My hand is pretty sore and it takes two good hands to handle this ship. The controls have 75 lbs. Tension and it’s a man’s job to pull one of these baby’s into a 60 degree bank without losing altitude. I went to church with art the second Sunday I was here. We went out to dinner together and had a swell time. I really like the car dad. It’s in swell shape and I intend to keep it that way. The tires are beauties I sure do appreciate you helping me but it. I don’t intend to do a lot of excessive driving in it, however, Amarillo is about 250 miles from here and I plan on saving gas and driving up to see Tod if I can ever get a weekend off. It’s a long way but I think it would be well worth it before I leave Texas.
	I’m sorry about the missing pictures dad. I guess it was just a misunderstanding. I tried to pay ?oren before I kept (that was before you gave me the check) and he absolutely refused to take the money. And invested that I keep it and send it to them after I got here. He said as far as everything was concerned it was the same as paid. It was kind of a dirty trick to refuse to give the pictures to Roberto because they weren’t paid for. I sent them the money I hope it’s all straightened out now. Please write often
	Love Ralph.
P.S I got a letter from Tod. He says he’s doing ok. Excuse the scrawling I’m writing in a hurry so I can get to class.



5 Oct. 1944 Italy
Dear Mom & Dad, 
	I’ve got to fly a mission tomorrow so this will probably be short as I need the sleep. I wish I were there to help you with that new fi truck too dad. I know it really must be tough to get help. I guess you’ll really miss Tod this year. When I get my fifty in I’ll see if I can come back and give you a hand. I hope so. 
	Dad, I’m sorry you felt so bad about my buzzing. It was very foolish. There really isn’t any justification in doing it just for fun but it’s just something everyone has to cut loose and do once in a while. There are times here when knowing how to hit the deck low and fast will save your life and the life of those mine boys riding with you. 
	It isn’t pleasant to see the realities of a war. I’m not saying this so you’ll worry more because I know how you must worry about me now. I just believe I should let you know just what the score is. One of the finest chaps I know is a tail gunner on my buddy’s crew. They were flying right next to me yesterday and I saw the tail end of his ship blow up and disintegrate from a direct flak blast. That isn’t often but it does happen. The chances of coming back are far better than those of going down. The only thing everyone can do is know the rules of the game, whether the game is flying, religion as just loving in itself; and play the game the best I can by sticking to the rules. That way regardless of what happens if you’ve tried our best to do the right thing things will turn out for the best.
	Dad, I’ve seen the worst an enemy can hand out to us and I do know that praying helps. You don’t pray ant because you’re too busy but when you see it coming you put a lot of trust into your heavenly father. We came back yesterday with the hydraulic system for the flaps, landing gear and brakes shot out. We set her down safe and no one had a scratch: I know that it was with the help of the lord that we were able to do that. Don’t worry too much. I plan on getting my fifty. Please write often & write long letters.
	Hello farmers & fermis love, Ralph


Dear mom and dad,
	Guess what, you know how you wouldn’t ever let me buy a motorcycle. Well, here’s the payoff. When we got back from a mission two days ago I went to town and looked up a P-38 pilot who had a motorcycle he wanted to sell me. I agreed on $200 as I could easily get that out of it if I leave here. Well, I came back out to the field and requested a partial pay as I haven’t had my pay for two months. Captain Janesh, my squadron commander asked me what the score was. I told him I wanted a $200 partial pay to buy me a motorcycle. Well here’s the payoff. We had just gotten back from a mission and after flying through the soup to get there, & through the flak & coming back through that stuff & making a forced landing on someone else’s landing strips he told me I couldn’t buy the motorcycle because it’s too dangerous. Mom, I guess I just wasn’t cut out for anything as dangerous as a motorcycle. And to think I thought “ha, mom can’t stop me from buying this motorcycle now. Well, its 2030 and I’ve got to go on another mission tomorrow I’ll write some more when I get back. I’ll try to get some pictures to send you. Please take some and send them to me.

Dear Mom & Dad,
	It ain’t the heat nor the blistered feet, nor the meals of spam in place of meat, nor the butter like lard, nor our turn at guard, none of these is as half as hard as to jolt in after all the sweat and a cheery voice says “no mail yet.” 
	And it ain’t the breeze, like a dragon’s sneeze, that pecks the kids and weakens the knees nor the dirt in your gun nor the broiling sun. These are forgotten when day is done but our voices fail and our faces pale as we draw a blank when it’s time for mail.
	He can stand the flies and the sand in our eyes, the orders, the rumors, the truth, and the lies, the mosquitos swarm and the water warm and the warts that reek of chloroform what takes our light and makes throats tight are the letters somebody didn’t write.
	I guess I shouldn’t have sent the poem but it was so true I couldn’t resist. The mail has been reaching me though and I’ve been getting quite a few letters. Some get here in as few as ten to twelve days. There however are still straggling in from September. I’ve got to go to bed so I’ll quit. I’m tower officer tomorrow and I’ll have plenty of time so I’ll write more then.
							Love, Ralph



20 Nov. 1944
Dear Dad, I got your letter today saying you were sorry for not writing. It made me feel kind of ashamed of myself for writing such a hasty letter the other morning just because I didn’t get a letter. I know you’re a lot busier there than I am here and I find it hard to sit down and write instead of hitting the bed when I’m through for the day. I know what kind of a deal you must have there this fall with no more help than you have. There’s really not much of a load to carry here dad. 54% below zero over the target and pounding through an eight to nine hour flight do get tiresome but there are hundreds of other guys doing the same thing. It may sound a bit funny and may not be exactly the right thing but I look at it this way. There’s a little white kind of paper in operations that has my name on it and 35 squares. I’m sorta living right there on that piece of paper. Every time when I come back from a mission no matter how rough it was or how much we got shot up I feel good when my whole crew is OK and we walk in and see another one of those white squares colored red. We got 18 of them colored and 17 more and we’ll be seeing the ones we love at home. Of course besides just finishing our missions all of us like to feel as though were helping to finishing this thing as fast as possible. Dad. I find the things that occupy my mid most are plain ordinary things of life. I want to come home just to live for the joy of living & doing [what] I want to get up in the morning, do a good hard day’s work, eat a good meal at a good family table, say hello to neighbors, shoot pheasants, walk out through a pretty field of spuds, drive to town through the snow, go to church on Sunday with my dad, wrestle with the boys and tease mom and the girls, sing in the choir, have a family dinner together on thanksgiving, go fishing, haul more beans with my truck than the next guy can with his, hug my mom, marry the sweetest girl in the world, do as fine a job raising a family as my dad has, build a house and help to make it a home; a million things like that are what I want to live for dad. When I hear a beautiful piece of music that’s what it says, and when I pray those are the things I ask my heavenly father to let me do. I know your faith and prayers are always with me and I hope I can live up to the kind of life you meant for me. I know the mail is pretty bad and how busy you are so I’ll try to have more patience hereafter, and I’ll try to write a little more regularly too. Dad I pray for the lord to forgive us of the things we do wrong and to help us to live worthy of the great blessings we have and thank him very much for my parents. Love, Ralph

I'm also concurrently on an Age of Exploration kick as well and both periods have pretty heavy undertones of meddling in the regions surrounding the Black Sea. This was just sort of a diversion and nagging question at the back of my mind.

EDIT: My intention with this question was not to open a discussion or debate over race (as even the concept of 'race' is debatable). My curiosity ends at the etymology of the word 'Caucasian' as it relates to geography and history alone. Thankfully my question has been answered and my curiosity quenched by many wonderful and properly cited sources. Thank you to everyone who contributed meaningfully!

Since January 2018 I’ve run [a twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/100YearsAgoLive) that live-tweets history from 100 years ago as it happened. In the process I’ve learned a ton about WWI, its violent aftermath, and the onset of the roaring 20s.

AMA about the account or the  year 1920 in general!

History books and classes tend to go from End of WWI -> Great Depression -> WWII without paying attention to anything else. In reality, the period immediately following WWI was almost as chaotic and violent as the war itself. Right now in 1920 we have going on simultaneously:

* the resurgence of the 1918-19 Spanish flu, which would ultimately claim nearly 40 million lives
* the Bolsheviks consolidating power as they near victory in the Russian Civil War, swallowing up surrounding nations
* a ton of independence movements around the world and nations declaring freedom left and right
* civil war in Germany and Ireland
* a war between the Soviet Union and virtually all its Western neighbors
* revolutions around the world and communist uprisings in Western Europe
* women’s suffrage
* workers’ strikes
* Political drama in the US with an incapacitated President Wilson essentially being a puppet during the 1920 Presidential election
* pogroms everywhere
* post-WWI famines
* technological innovations out the wazoo

Surprising stuff is happening, too, that I never thought actually occurred. Did you know:

* The Islamic leaders of both Sultanate and republican Turkey declared jihad on each other?
* Midget boxing was one of the most popular rising sports of the year?
* The future King of England became fond of surfing in Hawaii and spent some time playing around in Honolulu?
* People were mailing live children via the US Postal Service?
* The President of Uruguay shot and killed a newspaper editor in a legal duel?

And all this is happening IN APRIL 1920! 1920 is very interesting and vital to the study of history.

Edit: additionally, I run a similar project for 50 Years Ago at the handle @50YearsAgoLive. We just finished up the Apollo 13 debacle and we’re moving steadily into the groovy 70s."

But what few know is that by 1943, the Germans had built up some pretty decent evidence that Enigma was vulnerable.  U-boat rendezvous were being interrupted by Allied forces.  A spy in Washington, DC reported that the Allies were currently reading 4 rotor Naval Enigma traffic, and that report found its way to the Abwehr.  Rommel had a submarine cable laid between North Africa and Italy, and used that as much as possible in preference to radio.  In 1944, a German cryptanalyst showed that Enigma could be broken with a crib of just 50 letters.
https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/declassified-documents/tech-journals/assets/files/der-fall-wicher.pdf

Perhaps the clincher, though, is that the Ubootwaffe started experimenting in June 1944 with assigning each operational U-boat on war patrol with their own set of unique Enigma keys.  Prior practice during the convoy battles earlier in the war was to have a set of keys for a particular area, say, ""North Sea"", ""North Atlantic East"", ""North Atlantic West"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""South Atlantic"" key nets.   All U-boats assigned to patrol, say, the North Sea would get the same set of keys.  This allowed the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park and in Washington DC to build up enough traffic to break the settings on their bombes.  But the lack of traffic in any one key setting effectively prevents that.  By February 1945, nearly all U-boats setting sail on war patrols carried their own unique Enigma keying documents, and the Allies were almost completely shut off from reading U-boat radio traffic.
https://books.google.com/books?id=KO8crflI8AMC&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=Stummel+began+in+1944+to+prepare+a+measure&source=bl&ots=4l22agG837&sig=eA3RjQg6Jo8CfRFi_oFTcBt5mDs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitzIefrPLUAhUJGj4KHc5cDdwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Stummel%20began%20in%201944%20to%20prepare%20a%20measure&f=false

I have a personal suspicion that certain people in the German military ""knew"" that Enigma was vulnerable in the latter half of the war and acted accordingly.  They couldn't make a wholesale change, however, because they were too invested in the device.  They had untold thousands in service, and couldn't just abandon them for something different.  

With the secret of Allied success against the Enigma kept secret for around 30 years, along with the cynical sale of Enigmas to ""allies"" of the US and UK, it's illustrative to note that the Germans rejected the Enigma for a much more secure rotor machine when they needed something after the war.

The man responded with asking why the Ottoman Empire isn't mentioned regarding colonialism but the British Empire is, which I guess implies that the Ottoman Empire must have been just as bad in his opinion. 

I imagine this is because the British Empire colonised nations that people who now live in the West share ancestors with but I don't really know enough about the subject so thought I'd ask those that do.

Cheers.

[answered] I think the most common answers are that the Ottoman Empire, unlike the British, wasn't actually a colonial empire. They didn't economically siphon where they conquered to pump up the heart of the empire. 

Also, because I'm English, I'm bound to hear more of the British Empire and the troubles it has left behind than I am of the Ottoman.

Nice one, everyone. "

yesterday I found my grandpa's WW2 mess kit in my parents' house. 
Curiously, the mess kit is apparently a Japanese production and has also some Japanese (or Chinese?) handwriting on it.

http://imgur.com/a/8XY4D

My grandpa wrote his initials (J.G.) on the mess kit, overwriting other initials (K.K.). He fought for the Wehrmacht on the eastern front and was later a POW in what today is Kazakhstan.

Why would the Wehrmacht use Japanese/Chinese mess kits?
What does the Japanese handwritten signs say?
Could he have gotten the kit as POW?
What's the story behind this?

Thank you very much!

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses! Looks like my grandpa got the kit in POW camp in Kazakhstan. As u/JacqueShellacque and u/petro26 pointed out it's a Japanese production from 1942. It probably was originally the mess kit of a Japanese soldier, it seems like 木暮 is the family name of the soldier it belonged to originally, Kogure. In between it apparently belonged to some other soldier with the initials K.K.
As u/R0cket_Surgeon and u/W_I_Water pointed out, the Soviets captured Japanese equipment, for example from the Kwantung Army in '45. They might have redistributed it to their POWs. Thanks again!

EDIT2: /u/Yasuhide_Oomori says it's the mess kit of the Imperial Japanese Army, called ""Ro Gou Hangou"". They even made an explanatory picture http://i.imgur.com/v5GLAw8.jpg
/u/burgerthrow1 adds that the kit also served as a rice cooker. And: ""KK"" was most likely another European POW. Japanese soldiers were forbidden from writing in Western characters."

I gave her a call tonight and confirmed she still has those letters mentioned above. And like some have mentioned, she is aware of the Attorney/Client confidentiality, and is playing it safe by not sharing them publicly. I asked her if she'd be interested in answering some questions if people really wanted to know, and she said yes. She also told me people still call her once or twice a year to ask for her to star in documentaries and interviews.

We have agreed to talk about this on Monday where I'll confirm a Q&A from the sheer amount of interest from this thread."

Hundreds. Some from WW1, the rest from WW2. They are completely original, in envelopes, with post marks etc, and in pretty good condition.

I thought this one was interesting as the soldier writing mentions German snipers and ruined French towns (and some fairly mundane things too), dated 22 Aug 1915 - sent to my great grandparents by this young man in the army, in the trenches, fighting the Germans, in the north east of France, in Loos (near Lille) near the border with Belgium.

http://imgur.com/a/mhrIT

The letter is from Private Edward Currie, 12th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, British Expeditionary Force. He was killed on 25 Sept 1915, 34 days after writing this, and is buried in Loos Memorial, Pas de Calais, France. It is quite hard to read from the images, here is a transcription:

""Pte Edw. Currie 19054, 
D Coy, 12th Batt, 
H.L.I, 
B.E.F., 
22nd Aug 1915

Dear Mam,

I now take time to write to you, as I know you are anxious to hear from me. I had made up my mind not to write to you again, after our little difference of opinion, but it was against my grain, as I know you were always interested in me, and I know it would be too bad not to let you know how I am getting along whilst in the trenches. I am in the trenches at present, having a lively time of it, and quite realise the murderous work the Germans are doing. Censorship prevents me telling the names of places I have been in, but they are a sight. Beautiful garden citys with no sign of life whatsoever, with these many mansions furnished complete, with the roof blown off, or the gables of the wall shattered, with these many shells, as one goes further along only skeleton of houses are to be seen. Our Dugouts in the trenches are furnished with mirrors, chairs, etc, making things making things look cosy and comfortable. Those being had from the ruined houses close at hand. By day our sentries watch over the parapet just across to the enemy's trenches a few hundred yards away. If there heads were to be seen, they are sure to be shot at, and they are pretty good shots too. They possess a set of men called snipers who seem to be everywhere, that one can't be too sure where he goes in case he is within range of one of these fellows. this is all I can say about trench life in the meantime, it is giving you an idea what is the case in some of the many places in France. I saw Mr <Name>'s brother in (one) of the villages I have been in he was taking over our billets for his battallion the 10th Gordons as we were leaving for the trenches. I myself am having a good time of it and have nothing to complain off, although we aren't getting it all our own way. I hope to be remembered to all the boys, and to those who are anxious to know how I am keeping. I will close in the meantime, hoping you all spent an enjoyable holiday camp, thoughts of it reminding me of Monkton, and the good times I have spent there.

From yours truly
Eddy Currie""

EDIT: Wow thank you all for the responses and PMs. I have replied to you all individually, and am now going through the comments and will reply to any directed to me - wow, not sure I can keep going there's a lot.

Note 1: Monkton refers to a place near Glasgow in Scotland, I shall find out for sure but some of you in the comments have identified the location. My family is Scottish. Pte Edward Currie was Scottish. He died 25th Sept 1915, a month after this letter, I have located his memorial.

Note 2: I'm so sorry, the letters are not for sale, these are too historically valuable and money is not deserving of their worth (if you get me) however I will scan more of them for those who asked. I will endeavour to track down their descendants and give them the letters, the rightful owners I think. Failing that, war museums will gladly accept them I'm sure. I will post Pte Edward ""Eddy"" Currie's other 4 letters for you today - https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/51xofl/pte_edward_eddy_currie_ww1_soldier_letters_5_for/


Note 3: To clarify, these letters ARE currently in my possession (rightfully and honestly) - these young men were hosted at a boarding house ""Oakshaw"" ran by my grandfather's parents, after signing up/prescription, and before they were posted to the south of England, prior to deployment in France. They wrote, very kindly back to my great grandmother ""Mam"" to keep her updated of how they were. I assume they would also have written to their parents but of course I do not have those letters.

Note 4: Thank you, humbly, for the PMs from current and ex-military. I hope my replies were worthy enough.

Note 5: ""billets"" - temporary housing for soldiers. The missing words: ""I hope to be remembered to all the boys"".

Note 6: The 'disagreement' some of you ask about - does NOT sound romantic, more like he mis-behaved before he left/stole something/argued about politics/the war ? Not sure. i will try and find out."

[Here's the link to the original letter.](http://imgur.com/a/wMrSU)



*And here's the full transcription...*






**Philippine Islands
July 25, 1945**



Stan:


From out of the Philippines (where it, my dear lawyer, is still spelled with (1)L) I send a reply to one of the foulest notes that it has ever been my misfortune to receive.  




Quote ""As for myself, I have been very busy the last week or two.  Although the course of work in this hard boiled, slave driving, under paid profession etc. etc.""




Well, little boy, you may be a shining light in the tiny legal world you exist in, but the insinuation you made in your letter showed me that you don't know what life today is all about.  You are living in a sphere that is bound up with things cut and dried, things which are dealt with as cases and not realities.  And yet you have the impudent gall to sit back and complain about your own way of life.




You who have always had a good home, fine parents, and sufficient funds.  You attended a private school, a college, and a law school in spite of the times.  You got a job in an old firm and you have your place in life.  In other words, you have had everything handed to you on a silver platter and yet you still complain.




You also speak of being busy -- well that is a joke.  It seems to me that I have heard of some others who are busy today.  Have you heard of the B-29 boys over Japan?  Or the carrier task force?  Or the boys who took back the Philippines?  Or the 19,000 boys who had a busy time on Okinawa?  Or the guys on Saipan, Guam, New Guinea, or Guadalcanal.  Or course the Aussies are not busy on Borneo -- of course not!  No these guys and millions of others are merely sitting around finely furnished offices and telling others they ""have been very busy.""




As for being ""hard boiled"" there is no such thing in the service.  All those with whom we associate treat us like their own children.  Things are always calm and serene.  The cases one finds are never crude or tough.  The stinking corpses of American boys (boys whom life never gave a chance) are nice things to observe.  No, life in this business is not hard boiled.  If it isn't then neither is a sniper's bullet thru the forehead.




And then you mentioned ""slave driving"".  The phrase used by you is sheer mockery.  The works of the coalies on the great airfields of China was sheer pleasure.  The Anzio beachead was a picnic for the boys carving out that tiny foothold.  The boys who spanned the plane under point blank fire were having an enjoyable time.  The guys who lugged ashore on their backs the supplies that helped to take Tarawa were just getting some exercise.  No this was not slave driving work it was mere amusement as one might take back home on a quiet Sunday afternoon.




And then you said ""under paid.""  That is just plain riot.  The boys who were killed at Pearl Harbor were ""under paid.""  The men at Kiska and Attu ""were under paid"".  The boys who hit the beach of Normandy ""were underpaid.""  The maquis of France ""were under paid.""  No according to you these men were making a fortune.  Some will come back but is the stinking $50 a month overpaying a dead American private in the lonely mountains of Italy.  Is the service pay of a pilot too much?  Of course he may come back, but there is a chance he may be just charred remains in a wrecked plane.  He does not earn his money he is overpaid.  Yes the boys who invade Japan will be overpaid.  It is too bad that the legal profession cannot pay off like the services fighting this war.  Yes we are all wealthy men according to your idea of being underpaid.""





Stan, I have always respected you for your knowledge and ability but you seem to be so wrapped up in that smug little world of yours that you don't know what is going on in terms of reality.

You see newsreels, read papers, scan magazines and that makes you a judge of your position.  Whether you know it or not you are a very lucky guy.  You have your education, your job and future planned.  And then on top of that you have the audacity to write ""hard-boiled, slave driving, under paid profession.""




If this letter does nothing else I hope that it makes you ashamed of yourself right down to the marrow of your bones.  YOu may say now, ""Who is Brown that he can pass judgment on the great lawyer?""  Granted to your way of thinking he is not in a position to do so.  I think differently.




I am a guy who only had three years in college.  I never graduated or went on to a professional school.  I know very little in the formal sense of the word but you ungrateful wretch I still know more about life than you ever will (unless you change).




I have seen life in its rawest and crudest and death too for that matter.  Yes my sheltered intellect the intellect the sordid and foul things of life can teach lessons.  I have learned things and learned to appreciate things that only the College of Life can teach.  I don't regret this; in fact I am proud of it and I think I will be a better person for all of it.  




If you are half a man you will make some reply to what I have written above.  I realize that it may not be a finely phrased but the truth is not always finely phrased.




Your obedient slave,


Sgt. Richard H. Brown


Army Air Forces


Somewhere in the Philippines





**EDIT**: I'm almost certain that I found Sgt. Brown's obituary and I've identified a surviving daughter.  Interestingly enough, if it's the right obituary, and the daughter is the person I'm thinking of, I actually went to school with Sgt. Brown's grandson for a few years and our families know each other, having met at school functions in the past.  I'll be reaching out to Sgt. Brown's daughter today to offer her these letters.



**EDIT 2**: Left a voicemail on the only number I found on the daughter.  Guess I can only wait and see...



**EDIT 3**: Welp, obligatory thanks for the gold.  I left another voicemail on another number I found.  Waiting on a call back.  So unfortunately no real updates.  Glad this meant so much to so many people, though.  Of course, will update when I have one."

Hello, I’m Ben Raines. I’m a newspaper reporter by trade, so I kept my hunt for the Clotilda, the last American slave ship, secret. I thought people would think I was nuts if I said I was going to look for a ship that had been missing for 150 years. While we can’t say for certain yet that this is the Clotilda, we know that the wreck is from the right era, is the right size, lies roughly where the captain said he burned it in 1860, and the wreck appears to have been burnt.
 
In the end, finding it was mostly down to old fashioned sleuthing. I searched through old records, maps, interviews and newspaper articles, some 150 years old. One of my best resources was a handwritten journal kept by the captain of the Clotilda. I used our epic winter weather this year, including the Bomb Cyclone on the east coast, and the super low tides that resulted from stout north winds for my search window. With the tide so far out, it was if a blanket had been pulled back from the giant swamp where the ship was supposed to have been burned in 1860. There, lying in the mud near an island where the captain said he burned it, I found the wreck of a huge sailing vessel.
 
All of the members of this AMA panel are quoted [in my original story about the wreck, which you can read here](http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2018/01/alcom_reporter_may_have_found.html#incart_big-photo) (don’t forget to watch the video!).
 
On the panel with me are John Sledge, a historian specializing in the tale of the Clotilda and the port of Mobile, and author of the exhaustive history The Mobile River, and two archaeologists from the University of West Florida, Dr. John Bratten and Dr. Greg Cook. Together, they have previously dug up Spanish galleons sunk in 1559 and slave ships off the coast of Ghana. All three of them have visited the Clotilda and can provide amazing insights into the past and the techniques that will be used to investigate this ship. We can also talk about the incredible history of Africatown, the Alabama community started by the survivors of the Clotilda.
 
Ultimately, because of Africatown, the Clotilda is an even more powerful totem than just a slave ship. It is the last slave ship. What’s more, we know more about its voyage and the fate of the 110 souls imprisoned on board than is known about any of the millions of people brought in bondage to this country. We know exactly what part of Africa they came from, exactly when they arrived, who brought them here, and where they ended up after the Civil War. When the war ended just five years after their arrival, they were freed, but also homeless and destitute.  The discovery of the wreck is the final piece of the incredible story of Africatown, a community on the edge of the swamp north of Mobile formed by the Clotilda survivors in 1860 on land they bought from the plantation owner who enslaved them. Many of their descendants still live there today. It is the only community formed by native Africans in the United States. Even then, it was a place apart from both white and black Mobile. The Clotilda group spoke their native dialect, taught their children in their traditional way, and farmed using African methods.
 
Amazingly, their lives were forever interrupted to settle a $1,000 bet between a slave-owning steamboat captain and a group of northerners traveling on his riverboat. Join us for our AMA and ask us anything you can think of about this suddenly revealed piece of our past.

e25jlq,"No, we aren't here to write your essays for you.",6317,0.85,1,2019-11-27 03:40:24,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/e25jlq/no_we_arent_here_to_write_your_essays_for_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/e25jlq/no_we_arent_here_to_write_your_essays_for_you/,self.history,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Hi everyone, and especially our students,

It's exam season! Essays are due and, *oh shit*, deadlines have snuck up on you. We've all been there. However, we will not be approving your posts asking for help with homework, paper writing, or exam questions. This isn't new, but desperation seems to be driving people to try.

If you need help with your studies, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. They won't do it for you, but they can point you in the right direction.

When we've made these reminders in the past, several people have asked for clarification or stated they don't understand why we have such a policy. In general, it comes down to two main reasons:
 
####  Homework help doesn't generate a lot of discussion. They're usually very specific questions that are really only asked as part of homework. 


If in serious numbers (and around this time of year, we're looking at dozens a day) they tend to make the subreddit less attractive for the community in general. Some people might still wonder ""but what is the harm? People can just not respond"". Which is partially correct, we have one factor that makes it a bit more difficult here. 

***Scale***. 

We have roughly 2-3 million unique visitors per month in this subreddit. The sort of homework questions we are talking about are the ""drive-by"" kind of questions. Often very simple, not very engaging or interesting for the rest of the community. If allowed though they tend to flood the subreddit which will drown out other, better, threads.


#### Part of doing homework/research is applying and practicing the skills required for understanding and working with history. 

Asking people directly in /r/history defeats that very purpose. In many cases it is plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence, and anti-cheating software *does* scan reddit for similarities.

In those cases /r/HomeworkHelp is simply the better subreddit, as it focuses on the process of doing it properly. 

We've listed specific sorts of homework help and will apply mods discretion. We also have less of an issue with someone who already has done research, lists what they have found and how they have found it and then, for example, asks if there are more places or ways they can find additional information.

Thanks everyone! And good luck with your studies!"

I just found this flag yesterday at an estate auction.  They had it listed at a 48 star flag so I got it for a steal and it seems I was the only person who actually counted the number of stars.  I live in Colorado so this flag is even more cool because Colorado was the 38th state to join the United States.  This flag was made and hung sometime between 1877 and early 1890 when the 43 star flag was made.  I will most likely be keeping this in my personal collection but if a museum near me ever is going to be having an exhibit on Colorado becoming a state or something else this could relate to I will be giving it to them on loan. 


It isn't in the best of shape but compared to the other flags from around this time I have seen the colors are better and there are less holes. 


Thought it was a cool piece of history that ya'll would like to see! Also forgot to say that it is an 8 foot flag. Won't even fit on my huge dining room table!

Considering the immense power and size of the Roman Empire, some families had a lot of power and influence as well as lands. However, there are not so many records of what happened to these people and their descendants after the Roman Empire split in two and eventually after it was conquered.

I know Italy was heavily invaded by the Goths and Vandals and that those wars eventually resulted in Italy being very depopulated but wouldn't these powerful people have protected their families and themselves by going to other parts of the empire before an invasion?

Also, after the Dark Ages, many people claimed to be the ""King of the Romans"" and many kings claimed to be the successors of the romans but nobody seems to have claimed direct descend from a Roman ruler or a Roman family.

What happened to this people? 

The oldest contemporary family with proven ties to the Roman Empire that I could find was the Massimo family but even their claim is a bit shady and could easily be just a rumour.  "

We completed missions over the battle zone of Iwo Jima and then on to Okinawa where the Makassar Strait suffered damage and we were transferred to the Shipley Bay. While on the Shipley Bay, my crew suffered a crash while trying to land on the carrier. All members survived and the replacement aircraft TBM-3 #69325 came a day or two later. Recently, I attended a fly-in at a local airport that had a TBM Avenger as the main attraction. After viewing the history of the aircraft from the owner I realized it was the same aircraft #69325 that was replaced to my squadron after the crash.

Unlike other known copies that had engraved images of the phases of the moon, this copy included watercolor paintings seemingly by author Galileo Galilei, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time.

A discovery that set the rare book market abuzz, the proof copy, if genuine, would be worth millions. Published in 1610, Sidereus Nuncius set in motion a scientific revolution. The first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, Galileo’s work challenged the belief that the Earth was the center of the universe.

Five hundred and fifty copies of the book were originally printed and roughly 150 of those editions are known to exist today. In 2005, when a seemingly original copy with the astronomer’s signature and watercolor paintings hit the market, Sidereus Nunciuscaused a worldwide sensation 400 years after its publication.

In 2012, however, this discovery was proven to be a fake and rocked the book market to its core.

In Secrets of the Dead: Galileo’s Moon, a team of experts uncover the truth behind the alleged proof copy of the revolutionary Sidereus Nuncius, featuring historian Nick Wilding, whose suspicions and dogged research exposed the fraud.

Turns out to be quite doable IMO. By using Opentopomap and Freemaptool's Horizonfinder I made this map (http://imgur.com/gallery/3smde) to show how far the Vikings had to venture into the unknown before land in the horizon disappeared behind them and before new land would appear in the horizon in front of them.

I have plotted the visible horizon from the most prominent peaks at the shores of the respective lands. As you can see, there is a lot of prominent peaks visible at great distances offshore all along their assumed trial. Perfectly suited for discovering new land. 

The longest unguided stretch is between the Faroe's and Iceland (picture) and would take roughly 10 hours under favorable conditions (182 km at 10 knots). A wee bit longer than the distance between Amsterdam and Brussels. 

If we take into account high probability of mirages in arctic waters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Superior_mirage) and the fact that the longships had masts up 16 meters high (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longship#Sail_and_mast)
extending range of 15 km either direction, it is quite possible that they could see land through the entire journeys with favorable conditions. 

During the polar summer the days are long, weather is pleasant and the Vikings probably had plenty of time on their hands, so they could probably tailor their time to explore. Moreover, the wide angle of error possible before missing land could mean 
that precise navigation was not very important. Now if they could sustain themselves during the journey by hunting and fishing it must have been a pretty straightforward task. 

Having sailed from Shetland to Norway myself in less than 24 hours during summer (350 km), I can say that it is surprisingly lenient. Additionally, I found some pictures of Snæfjell taken from Reykjavik to illustrate how much you can see at the eh.. event-horizon. Reykjavik lies right on the edge of the red circle around Snæfjellsnes. 
It is still clearly visible indeed, and if ""lost"" at sea, a welcome sight. For more fun on calculating horizon distances you could use this simple calculator. (http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm)

Either way though my question isn't really about who said it (though that is interesting as well) but more about how true do you think the statement is? I mean obviously it is a huge generalisation but that does not mean the general premise of the idea is not valid.

I know for instance that the US provided massive resources to both the Soviets and British, and it can easily be argued that the Soviets could have lost without American equipment, and it would have been much harder for the British in North Africa without the huge supplies coming from the US, even before the US entered the war.

I also know that most of the fighting was done on the east, and in reality the North Africa campaign and the Normandy campaign, and the move towards Germany from the west was often a sideshow in terms of numbers, size of the battles and importantly the amount of death. In fact most German soldiers as far as I know died in the east against the Soviet's.

As for the British, well they cracked the German codes giving them a massive advantage in both knowing what their enemy was doing but also providing misinformation. In fact the D-Day invasion might have failed if not for the British being able to misdirect the Germans into thinking the Western Allies were going to invade elsewhere. If the Germans had most of their forces closer to Normandy in early June 1944 then D-Day could have been very different. 

So ""WWII was won with British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood""

Why did they never invade and occupy it? Was it due to the strength of Swiss defenses (i.e the National Redoubt) and the Swiss Army? Was it due to an unavailability of resources and strategic capital necessary to mount an invasion? The latter seems improbable given Switzerland's small size and because at the Reich's peak circa 1942 they were able to mount massive offensives in Eastern Europe and Africa, but I may be wrong. I was just wondering since we're covering Nazi expansion in my Euro class and looking at a map today, I noticed they occupied pretty much everything around Switzerland, but never invaded the country itself."

Such a time period is defined by a more or less sudden catastrophic event, e.g. by a devastating war, epidemic, climate change, or political rebellion, triggering a sudden downfall of societal institutions and rule of law. This presupposes, of course, organized society to being with, degrading into more or less an unorganized one.

Such a society would lack organized police and functioning courts, and with no publicly maintained infrastructure or education system - but maybe with pockets of strong military and advanced education and research within wealthy subcultures (such as a powerful family, tribe, or geographical region, within the otherwise dystopian area). It would furthermore be characterised by stagnation, poverty, very little to no internal manufacturing of goods and lack of added value to economic organisations. 

Even though ""the public"" funding schools is quite a recent phenomena, there has many times existed some organisations (e.g. the catochilc church in medieval Europe) funding and supporting education. I am thus referring to a situation during which the local society and culture would have been drastically changed for the worse, greatly reducing conditions for quality of life for the common man, as compared to _before_ the dystopian regime.

In order to qualify as a ""dystopian time period"", I'm thinking a duration of atleast 75-125 years. Hence, I'm not asking about temporary anarchy (examples of those are more easy to find online).

Did any such time period exist anywhere in the world? Where/When? How long did it take to come out the stagnation and if it did, what would have been the most important factors inducing the change for the better?"

Our story begins with the army of the Medes (Persian neighbors and predecessors) meeting the army of the Lydians (credited with first creating silver/gold coinage) at the Halys River in modern day Turkey. The two nations had been engaged in a 6-year long war, and this battle was shaping up to be quite large and potentially decisive. 

Fighting broke out across the lines, and it was unclear which side would gain the upper hand until oddly enough, the sun went out.
To a very superstitious and religion-oriented people, eclipses were messages from the gods, or an omen at the very least. Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian writes that the two fighting armies ceased their fighting at sight of the eclipse, and brokered a truce through Babylon. 

Just thought I'd share with today's events and all. Funny how much our opinion of natural phenomena can change over the course of a few thousand years!

Edit 1: Thank you to the users who pointed out the error in my title! Battle was waged between Lydians and Medes, not Medes and Persians! 

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!"

A quick google search showed the the United States know about the persecution of Jews going on in Germany, as evidenced by the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Jews into the U.S, however persecution is a broad word which doesn't make clear how much was known. I thought that this would be an interesting topic since it is important for putting into context the U.S's decision not to enter the war until provoked and it is generally important for furthering my, and hopefully others, knowledge of one of the most horrible events in human history.

One more question I have if the U.S. did not know about the full extent of Jewish persecution is, how did the Nazi's hide what they were doing from the rest of the world?

Laid the foundation of philosophy in our western civilization 

Mathematics:
Archimedes - anticipated calculus, principle of lever etc. Without a doubt the greatest mathematician of his day, arguably the greatest until newton. He was simply too ahead of his time.

Euclid, pythagoras, thales etc. 

Architecture:

Parthenon, temple of Olympian, odeon of heroes Atticus 

I could go on, I am fascinated with ancient Greece because there doesnt seem to be any equivalents to it.

Bonus question: what happened that Greece is no longer the supreme intellectual leader?

I saw this a while ago on /r/suggestmeabook and then again a couple of hours ago on /r/books and I thought this may be super cool in this subreddit. (I suggest you check both threads! Awesome suggestions)

Historians, what is your speciality and which books would you recommend for an overall understanding? Can be any topic (Nazi Germany, History of Islam, anything and everything) Any expert that isn't necessarily a historian is also welcome to contribute suggestions :) 

Particularly, I'd love to hear some books on African, Russian and Asian (mostly South) history!

Edit to add: thanks a lot for the contribution people. So many interesting threads and subjects. I want to add that some have replied to this thread with topics they're interested on hoping some expert can appear and share some insight. Please check the new comments! Maybe you can find something you can contribute to. I've seen people ask about the history of games, to more insight into the Enlightenment, to the history of education itself. Every knowledge is awesome so please, help if you can! 

Edit #2: I'm going to start adding the specific topics people are asking for, hoping it can help visibility! Let me know if you want me to add the name of the user, if it helps, too. I can try linking the actual comment but later today as it's difficult in Mobile. I will update as they come, and as they're resolved as well! 

(Topics without hyperlinks are still only requests. Will put a link on the actual question so it can be answered easily tomorrow maybe, for now this is a lists of the topics on this thread so far and the links for the ones that have been answered already)

Edit #3: Gold! Oh my gosh, thank you so much kind anonymous. There are so many other posts and comments who deserved this yet you chose to give it to me. I'm very thankful. 

That being said! I'm going to start updating the list again. So many new topic requests have been asked, so many already answered. I'm also going to do a list of the topics that have already been covered-- as someone said, this may be helpful for someone in the future! Bear with me. It's late and I have to wake up early tomorrow for class, but I'll try to do as much as I can today! Keep it coming guys, let's share knowledge! 

Edit #4: I want to also take the opportunity to bring attention to the amazing people at /r/AskHistorians, who not only reply to questions like this every day, they have in their sidebar a [lot of books and resources in many topics](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). Not exactly divided in these three options, but you can look up if they're appropriate for your level of understanding, but it's a valuable resource anyway. You may find what you're looking for there. Some of the topics that people haven't answered, either, can be found there! "

It made me think that there is a wealth of uncommonly known facts, stats and stories out there which have made a huge impact on the world, yet remain unknown.

Several key figures seem to have been stuck in this mental state.

What was a going on here? Why did they think one thing and then do the complete opposite? Was it just ego and a fool's hope that if we just do a little more we could push to the victory that just might be around corner? Did they just think their own political careers and wanted to keep the war out of people's minds so it wouldn't damage their own futures? Seems crazy that Lyndon Johnson was on one hand for social change in his own country but then completely selfish with such an big issue of the war. I don't know much about McNamara but it is very clear in the series that he probably was the worst with this kind lf thinking."

This is always posted sourceless, highly upvoted, and seems to perpetuate as an accepted fact, probably because it’s disgusting.

In all my research on this subject, I cannot find a single source of lobster shells being crushed in the entire history of lobster canning, between a dozen books on the subject, encyclopedia entries, and two dozen articles about lobster canning.  Lobster shells are made out of chitin and are entirely inedible.  Furthermore, there is no economical reason for trying to mash up rock-hard lobster shells to ‘stretch’ an abundant product, especially in an era before industrial grinders were available.

In the colonial times, lobsters were harvested from tidal pools by hand, and were in extreme abundance.  They were fed to children, prisoners, and indentured servants.  They were also often used as fertilizer and animal feed.  According to food historian Kathleen Curtin, prisoners and indentured servants enacting laws to limit how often they were fed lobster is also a myth, and there isn’t a shred of documentation of it actually happening.

Very early canning often produced unappetizing lobster because of incomplete sterilization.  Lobsters were cooked in large vats, picked from the shells by hand, then packed in cans which were then heat treated.  Lobster had a reputation for being “green in the sea, red in the pot, and black in the can”.  The cans would also often pop from fermenting due to spoilage.  Improvements in the canning process over the years helped prevent this from happening.  In those days, a 4-5 lb lobster was considered small, and a 2 lb lobster was discarded as being not worth the effort.

Lobster’s reputation started improving when demand for live lobsters increased as an inland luxury food, and because it wasn’t rationed during World War II like most other foods were.  Ships filled with water, called ‘smacks’ to transport live lobsters instead of canned, also made them much more popular.

Today, lobsters are mostly eaten fresh, but you can still find canned lobster if you look for it.  And no, it doesn’t contain the shells.

The missionaries that Asoka sent to China, Japan and other far-eastern countries in the 2nd century B.C. were a major contributing factor to the buddhist and pacifist lifestyles of their people that we see today. And from China, it spread to the west of course, in the end.

7m75o9,"Life in medieval village of Montaillou, described in detail (names and personal lives) thanks to the recordings of a local inquisition chief and his interviews with locals",5571,0.95,237,2017-12-26 16:17:10,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7m75o9/life_in_medieval_village_of_montaillou_described/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7m75o9/life_in_medieval_village_of_montaillou_described/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,False,False," I will try to summarily describe the context of my title as well as the book, it being the incredible insight in lives of locals.
The man, Jacques Fournier, was obsessed with recording nearly everything, and during his few years of chasing heretics in southern France (early 14th century) , he conducted hundreds of interviews/interrogations with locals, ranging from peasants to clergy and nobles, recorded nearly every word on paper and later brought those texts with him when he became the Pope, so they survived.
In 1975, using those texts as a basis a French historian wrote a very fun book called ''Montaillou'', by the name of the village that is the focus of the story. Book doesn't have a fictional story, it simply follows the village over those years, using Fourniers texts as a basis.  Amazing thing is that the said village still exists, with the same name and the same place (as do all surrounding villages). Right next to it are remains of a small castle/fort which was mentioned a lot in the book.

The reason why Montaillu is the subject of a modern book is because 25 of the interviewed people came from that village - a village numbering less than 200 people. That gave as an incredible insight in lives of ordinary people, who were ironically immortalized by the man that they were afraid the most - by immortalized, i mean that we know their names, their occupations, their private problems, their opinions of their neighbors, their world view, religious view, the course of their life over those 10 or so years.

For example, we know that the village had a castellan from the local noble family of Foix, he and his wife being the only nobles in the village. Community being small, he was practically the ''jack of all services'' doing various work, both policing and helping the local populace in anything needed. His wife was a lot younger and after he died she left the village and moved to the one next to it. She had quite a few lovers, including a local clergyman. Interesting thing is that she had quite a normal friendships with local peasant women, e.g. she would meet a girl she knows and they would hug in the middle of the street and chat like any modern neighbors.

People almost never spent time inside their own house except during night - when not working, which was quite often because of mad number of free days, people would visit each other, spending time in other houses or simply in the field or street, chatting all day. Also, it is described that a lot of people lacked certain things in their own homes (which were practically one room houses with no furniture), so those that had things like oven or certain tools, freely landed them to their neighbors.

A village had a small tavern with a barmaid who brought beer and occasionally wine at the doorstep of her customers, by order. Folks used to travel quite a lot (which is surprise to me since i always thought medieval peasants never went anywhere), visiting festivals and fares in towns up to 50 miles away. They also took their grain to the local town (Ax-les-Termes, still exists)  some 20 miles away nearly weekly, since the village didn't have a mill. Some men occasionally visited the same town because of prostitutes - the town possessed a nearest brothel, and inquisition seemingly had no problem with it.

The political opinion of locals is well described by one of the heretics ''There are four evils in this world - the satan, the king of France, the Pope and our local bishop'', quite describing that their world view was somehow very limited. In other details it can be concluded that their knowledge of the world didnt expand further than 100 mile radius.

Atheism was of course punishable, but there were few people here and there who publicly gave some atheistic claims, like:

A witness told Fournier that Raimond deserved to be put to death for saying that Christ was not created through divine intervention, but ""just through screwing, like everybody else.""

Guillemette of Ornolac, was brought in for interrogation because she doubted the existence of the soul. She expressed the opinion that what is referred to as the “soul” is nothing more than blood and that death is final. When Fournier asked her if anyone had taught her these ideas, she answered: “No, I thought it over and believed it myself.''

Mortality of course was very high, and was viewed by locals as an absolutely normal thing. Death of a child was nowhere near traumatic as it is for modern women. Hunger was periodic - there were practically alternating periods when they ate a lot and were practically getting fat, and then periods when they would be on the verge of starvation - this happened within the year, with early spring being the worst period.

And so on and so on, for more details there's the book,   anyway i recommend this book to any history fanatic, but to anyone else too really - it's much more fun than it sounds, and it kind of humanizes the famous peasants of medieval times, showing us that they weren't nearly as stupid or ape-like as portrayed in movies. They weren't too different from some highlanders that right now live in semi-isolated places of Appalachian mountains or northern Scotland etc.

Village today (the church is very well preserved from the time of the story and still functioning, while the castle is just a ruin)

Washington National Monument in Virginia. While reading one of the information posts, one sentence resonated with me in such a way that I walked away with a new understanding of what slavery in the United States was like. Addressing the slave trade, it read along the lines of, ""While physical punishment was certainly a factor that kept slaves working to produce high-quality crops, an even larger factor was the possibility of family members being sold away if crops did not yield enough money for the plantation owners. Slaves worked to keep their families together.""

That really just portrays the horror of slavery in a way that no textbook has ever been able to for me.

Update 2: Video changed to 480p without subtitles. Thank you u/My_Penis_Huge                                        here is the original video I posted with dutch subs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdUq993AsQc
also on the pbs website: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/view/#lower

Update 3: Some additional information about the film thanks to u/Khnagar:
""Memory of the camps"" is indeed Hitchock's documentary about the camps, but it was not ""hidden from the public"" for fourty years. After the war interest in the footage waned, there were plenty of similar documentaries around, and the footage used for ""Memory of the camps"" was available in various film archives and institutions, not at all hidden away. Hitchcock was involved with the documentary, but it was not his creation alone, and it seems that his involvement had mostly to do with how the material was structured.
In 1980 someone discovered the old reels (though the sixth reel was missing), and it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 1984, and broadcast on American PBS in 1985. The youtube uploader seems to have ripped this from a 1993 VCD.
I remember reading earlier this year that The Imperial War Museum is restoring the whole original movie, with the missing sixth reel, and it will be shown on the BBC in 2015, for the 70th anniversary for the liberation of Europe.

Update 4: WOW! Thanks for the gold! "

Just watching ‘Greatest Events of WWII in Colour’ on netflix and do the same thing - show Hitler speaking furiously, have his voice be audible but the captions say [speaking German]. How hard is it to put the paragraph that he’s spoken up there for the non German speakers? Just laziness and they all seem to do it.

Edit: seen a ton of points of view today and came to this conclusion: 

Safest compromise is to have the filmmakers be responsible for what gets translated and what doesn’t. If the true intent is to inform in an unbias objective manner then perhaps when it is not hateful rhetoeic that many fear will cause more nazis then how about a subtitle that says [inflammatory rhetoric]. Knowing that much would be a vast improvement.

I never knew that any such warning was given, and thought this was interesting so I thought I'd type it out the text from the  almost 72 year old document from a photo I snapped:
__________________________________________

Part I - Psychological Warfare

1. Below is a copy of the first leaflet (AB-11) which was dropped on Japanese cities in conjunction with the Atomic Bomb. 

2. A translation of the above leaflet follows:

TO THE JAPANESE PEOPLE:

""America asks that you take immediate heed of what we say in this leaflet.

We are in possession of the most destructive explosive ever devised by man. A single one of our newly developed atomic bombs is actually the equivalent in explosive power to what 2000 of our giant B-29's can carry on a single mission. This awful fact is one for you to ponder and we solemnly assure you it is grimly accurate.

We have just begun to use this weapon against your homeland. If you still have any doubt, make inquiry as to what happened to Hiroshima when just one atomic bomb fell on that city. 

Before using this bomb to destroy every resource of the military by which they are prolonging this useless war, we ask that you now petition your Emperor to end the war. Our President has outlined for you the thirteen consequences of an honorable surrender: We urge that you accept these consequences and begin the work of building a new, better, and peace-loving Japan. 

You should take steps now to cease military resistance. Otherwise, we shall resolutely employ this bomb and all our other superior weapons to promptly and forcefully end the war. 

EVACUATE YOUR CITIES

*end of document*

Edit: Didn't expect my post to get this much attention. Thanks /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov for clarifying the unfortunate timing of when these were dropped. Right after the second, but before potential additional bombs, apparently. IIRC there was another lined up to be ready a few weeks later. Fortunately the Japanese Empire surrendered when they did. 

In any case I've seen a lot of interesting discussion here on morality in war and justified use of force. Thanks for everyone's (civil) input.

"". . . I must not allow myself to dwell on the personal - there is no room for it here. Also it is demoralising. But I do not want to die. Not that I mind it for myself. If it be that I am to go, I am ready. But the thought that I may never see you or our darling baby again turns my bowels to water. I cannot think of it with even the semblance of equanimity.

My one consolation is the happiness that has been ours. Also my conscience is clear that I have always tried to make life a joy for you. I know at least that if I go you will not want. That is something. But it is the thought that we may be cut off from each other which is so terrible and that our Babe may grow up without my knowing her and without her knowing me. It is difficult to face. And I know your life without me would be a dull blank. Yet you must never let it become wholly so. For to you will be left the greatest charge in all the world; the upbringing of our baby. God bless that child, she is the hope of life to me. My darling, au revoir. It may well be that you will only have to read these lines as ones of passing interest. On the other hand, they may well be my last message to you. If they are, know through all your life that I loved you and baby with all my heart and soul, that you two sweet things were just all the world to me.

I pray God I may do my duty, for I know, whatever that may entail, you would not have it otherwise.""

Quite a few people were interested in it and I just got some crucial information about him and wanted to post an updated version of my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4a53d0/my_great_grandfather_kurt_wittig_and_his_life_and/):

My great grandfather was Kurt Wittig, born in 1912 in Berlin. He died on 9 March 1945 fighting the Red Army near Henryków Lubański. 

I started poking around in our family history in 2015 and amazingly my grandpa handed me a collection of ca. 150 photos his father Kurt took during his entire military career. I think they give you a very unique perspective into the life of a Wehrmacht soldier. This is the album of the most interesting photos: https://imgur.com/a/R1T92

What you can see in the pictures: 

* [Reichsarbeitsdienst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsarbeitsdienst)
* Bootcamp near Potsdam
* One or more pictures of the [Westfeldzug in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France)
* pictures from Poland right before the Attack on the USSR
* pictures from [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa) and subsequent operations in Ukraine

He took some notes on the back of the pictures which I included in the description. The furthest locations I got were in Eastern Ukraine/Southern Russia. 

Here is what I know about his military career based on information of the German [WASt](https://www.dd-wast.de/de/startseite.html):

* basic training with 4. / Infanterie-Ersatz-Battalion 9 in Potsdam until 30.05.1940
* transfer to Infanterie-Regiment 477 and assigned to 257. Infanterie-Division from 04.06.1940
 * deployment at [Maginot Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line) in June 1940
 * deployment in Poland in preparation for Operation Barbarossa in July 1940
 * marching into Ukraine in July 1941
 * transfer to France in August 1942 (rotation for resting maybe?)
 * deployment in Southern Russia in April 1943
* wounded (left thigh) in Donez (today Isjum) and promoted to Unteroffizier on 09.09.1943
* hospital leave till 25.11.1943 (in Reservelazarett 133 and XXI (Vienna))
* deployment around Kriwoi-Rog (today Krywyj Rih)
* KIA 09.03.1945 near Henryków Lubański from a ""Rohrkrepierer"" (I think in English that's a squib round) (assigned to Festungs-Infanterie-Bataillon 1458)

His detailed records don't exist anymore or are at least not present in the official archives. His regiment seems to have been wiped out in August 1944 after retreating across the Dniepr and Bug rivers in the months prior.

If you spot anything or have any questions, I am happy to help but I would be also grateful if you see anything that gives you hints about locations, unit, time. I already added a great deal of infos people helped me with. But maybe there is more. 

The intent of my post is not to glorify a man I never knew and that neither my parents of grandparents knew. I am simply researching one of my relatives and his live and death in the most horrible conflict the world has ever witnessed and if anything I want to encourage other people to do the same. My next project might be researching my other great grandfather who died in Italy in February 1945. "

For another example, the Lee-Enfield rifle was at first manufactured with a magazine cutoff, again to stop soldiers ‘wasting ammunition’. My question is, why was this doctrine dominant among some western militaries, and why were they so afraid of soldiers burning through all their ammunition?

I was just watching Black Mirror on Netflix. There is an episode about ethnic cleansing called Men Against Fire.

Most soldiers who fired their weapon aimed over the heads of their enemies to purposely miss because they couldn't handle killing another human being. He cited the world wars and the Vietnam war. He gave statistics that only about 15% were actually trying to shoot the enemy.

When I was in the army, they taught us to aim low because most soldiers aim too high. It was implied that this was done by accident rather than intentionally.

Do a large percentage of soldiers purposely miss or refuse to fire on the enemy?"

During the course of the war, the US military executed 161 men, mostly for rape, and or murder. Some took place in the US, some in Britain and in the case that I am about to outline, in Europe, after the D Day landings. 


Each case was investigated, a courts marshal trial was conducted and a verdict of guilty was returned. The order of execution was approved  by  either General Eisenhower or in some cases by the Commanding General of that theatre of the war.

Now to the hidden part. All of the 96 men were buried at the same place, a French civilian graveyard. All of the graves have only a number, from 1 to 96 on the headstones. No names, no unit, no serial number. Each of them had been hung, by a US army executioner, ( who lied to get the job by saying that he had been the State executioner in Georgia ) who botched quite  a few of the hangings because he was drunk. 

No body else wanted the job so he stayed in the job until the end of the war.

These men were hidden by the US military.

The reason ? Their victims were civilians, and that was hushed up.

Hey Everyone,


I was reading about the history of Somalia during world war 2. I knew a bit about the war so I was just refreshing my memory. However, I come across mention of a naval battle off the coast of Somalia. Apparently, bombers forced U-852 to beach on the coastline during a naval battle.  The text is below: 

>As U-852 broke the surface, her gun crews swarmed out and manned the anti-aircraft guns. Even as the crewman were reaching their battle stations, the Wellingtons were starting their second strafing run. The planes roared overhead and smothered the boat with fire. Oberleutnant Georg Colditz and Matrosenobergefreiter Josef Hofer both died on the bridge. 

>U-852 was down by the stern, unable to dive and under attack. By this time, it was clear to Eck that his boat was finished. While he could not save his boat, he was determined to save his crew, and his only hope of accomplishing this was to beach U-852 on the Somaliland coast before the British sank her. 

>Although doomed, the U-Boat managed to hold off the British throughout much of the day, her gunners beating off each aerial attack. Several of the crewmen were killed or wounded during the repeated strafing runs, but causalities were surprisingly light given the circumstances. That afternoon, while still under attack, Eck managed to save the bulk of his crew by beaching his battered boat off the Somaliland coast at Ras Hafun. 
>Source:  Theodore P. Savas - Silent Hunters: German U-Boat Commanders of World War II

Intrigued, I dug a bit deeper but couldn't find much information on what happened to the wreck. What I did find was that the Captain was unable to scuttle the ship. So the British were able to loot the boat. 

Since I am in Somalia, I decided to google the town ""Ras Hafun"" (In Somali: Xaafuun). I then zoomed in and went along the coast. **I was shocked to find what resembles a wreckage.** 

I am not 100% sure but the rock formations resemble those in the few photos that remain of the wreckage. Here is what I found:

[Wikipedia for U-852](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-852) 

Photos of the wrecked boat from WW2 [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeclicks/3536461275) and [here](https://legionmagazine.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HallidayInset21.jpg) **notice the rock formations** 

(Google map of the wreckage)[https://www.google.so/maps/place/Xaafuun/@10.4033218,51.2693899,205m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3da35bfe9a01caa1:0x8dddae942f710314!8m2!3d10.4232604!4d51.2612177!6m1!1e1] 

This could obviously be the wreckage of any ship, or it could be nothing at all. I was hoping for you guys to look at this and to get your opinions on the following:

1) Does this resemble the wreckage of a Uboat? 

2) Is the location of the wreck sufficient with the historical material?

3) Do you notice similar wrecks in the area? 

If there is enough interest, I can make a trip to the region (It will take atleast 2 days and some planning) to check out the site and confirm. 

Please let me know what you think. 

Edit: Map showing location of U-852 [here](http://i.imgur.com/uAKuuFg.png)

Edit2: Some sources say it was beached near Bandarbeyla (far away from Ras Hafun). I search this coast and was unable to find much. Can some people check out the coast here?

Edit3: I found an RAF report that says the wreckage was ""just south"" of Ras Hafun. This would coorespond with the wreckage found on google maps. https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-RAF-III/UK-RAF-III-11.html

In addition, I found a classified Australian military report on the incident. It is quite detailed. Just ctrl f ""852"" http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Naval%20Warfare%20Nov-1944.pdf

Edit 4: **Is anyone in the UK?** There are numerous photos, oral, and written accounts of the battle and search for U-852. However, they take quite a while to respond to me and charge a large fee to get the documents digitally. Can someone go to the Imperial War Museum in London in order to get copies of those documents?


Edit 5: Can someone look at 9.576783 50.803232 and tell me if it resembles a submarine? I see two distinct shapes. It is 100km from the original site though. So I am wondering if I should venture out.

Wife and I went to visit grandma today. She usually talks about everyday current family events whenever we visit her in Houston but today was different. I knew my grandfather and grandmother fought in a war in China, but never knew it was as far back as World War II until today. Were were eating lunch and she suddenly went into her bedroom and brought out some thing to show us.

&nbsp;

She brought out some newspaper clippings and pictures that my aunt took during a ceremony she was in back in April. She told me they, the people sponsoring the event, found about about her through the internet; which amazed me. She showed me the clippings her neighbors brought her. There were 7 or 8 people that they were presenting and she was the only female.

&nbsp;

Grandma never talked about what happened, that's why I never knew, except today she decided to open up a bit. She said my grandfather was in the medical corp and they were together, doctor and nurse, during WWII. She showed me the picture of my grandpa in the military and mentioned how handsome he was and how he's wearing his uniform with the medical badge.

&nbsp;

Then she brought up stories on how they would have to travel on foot to escape the Japanese, begging for food and shelter. How they have to travel at certain times to prevent capture, blood soaked foot wrapped in hay and more... A lot of the shelters were burned down to prevent the Japanese soldiers from utilizing it when they had to abandon it. She would be walking over dead bodies everywhere, making the trail to Jinmen, China for the battle. That's when the story ended and we talked about her upcoming birthday in November.

&nbsp;

She is a walking, living history book! Wonder what grandma will randomly bring up next time we visit..."

Was reading about [Charles VIII of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France). Interesting dude, lead a powerful French army, kicked off the Italian Wars, big impact on history. Died by smashing his head on the lintel of a door on his way to watch a tennis match. 

Such a bad way to die. But it jogged a memory. He wasn’t the only French king to die by smashing his head on a doorway. That lead me to [Louis III of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_III_of_France), who, as the story goes, died when he mounted his horse to chase down a frightened girl, & smashed his head on a low door way. 

Two kings of France killed because they didn’t duck. What are the odds. 

Then that got me curious about the deaths of other French Monarchs. Which led me to [Philip of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_of_France_(1116%E2%80%931131)); killed when his horse tripped over a pig while he was riding along a river. And [Charles II of Navarre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Navarre), who died when his doctor prescribed that he be wrapped in linen soaked in alcohol. The linen promptly caught fire; caused either by a careless maid with a candle, or a pan of coals to heat his bed. And, of course, [Henry II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_France) who died in a jousting accident, when the splinters of his opponent’s lance got through his visor & punctured his eye. 

That’s quite the list of accident prone monarchs. Dangerous being the king, and that’s not counting all the wars & assassins & that sort. 

So that got me thinking.  What are some other great examples of monarchs with ignoble deaths?"

Up until quite recently he was considered the worst serial killer in German history who supposedly killed 53 people (and confessed the murder of 84 actually). After modern examination of the cases, he most likely never killed a single person. And that story tells a lot about the Police in the Third Reich and the continuation of police work after WW2 in Germany.

Bruno Lüdke had a mild mental disability, someone who was considered ""unwertes Leben"" (unworthy life) according to the laws of Nazi Germany. After a few petty thefts, he was known to the police and actually sterilised in 1939.

In January 1943, the body of Frieda Rösner was found in Köpenick (South Eastern Borough of Berlin) and Bruno - who was from Köpenick - was found near the crime scene. Even though he was considered harmless, he started to confess the murder of Rösner and countless other murder victims dating as far back as the 20s.

It turned out that he had a complex interdependency with the police investigator.

Bruno Lüdke was both a blessing and a curse for the police and the propaganda apparatus: He fit the stereotype of a degenerate criminal perfectly but on the other hand he was living ""proof"" that someone could kill 53 people under the eyes of the police. Furthermore, he was a blessing to the police because they could produce results and confessions for unsolved cases which was the only thing they were supposed to do, there was no internal affairs department or compliance committee. There were policemen from other cities that objected to the obviously fabricated confessions: 
- how could a poor ""simpleton"" travel across Germany?
- how could he memorise complex geographical and criminological facts over a 20 year period if he didn't even know how many minutes an hour had?

But these protests were silenced, a detective from Hamburg was even sent to the Eastern Front where he died in 1944.

Lüdke was sent to Vienna eventually where medical tests were conducted and during one such test involving under-inflation they cut of his oxygen supply and he died. This was likely an ""elegant"" way to dispose of him.

During the Nuremberg trials, the Reich Police was not considered a criminal investigation which meant that a lot of policemen where vouching for each other that they were ""clean"" and could continue working in the police force. These policemen started working on the legend of Bruno Lüdke to justify their work and that they did a proper job even in an unjust system.

Only in the 90s, questions were asked and the files were examined."

I've been listening to a podcast that chronologically covers the written history, and one question keeps popping up in my head. It seems like during unstable times, almost any general who commanded an army(number of legions) could potentially march on Rome. 

How do these generals have so much pull over the soldiers they command? Is the answer as simple as ""because he's the general of those particular legions""? It seems like there would be more checks and balances to prevent this, but from what I'm gathering, many generals basically had their own armies that were under their sole command. Are the soldiers not loyal to Rome first?

Thanks for your time!

Edit: A lot of people have asked about the podcast. It's called ""The History of Rome""."

Pretty pictures [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/GMlV3gK.jpg) [*[mirror](https://i.imgur.com/FAmB5Qk.jpg)*] and [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/mqvpCbp.png) [*[mirror](https://i.imgur.com/DhjWeE6.png)*].

*Update*: also [here](http://tinyimg.io/i/NwNB9ly.jpg) (see comment at end).

*Clarification*: people are listed under the decade they were *born*, not then they were active. 

**Background**

I recently posted a graphic on /r/history showing [the most famous historical figures born each decade of the second millenium](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6x6hly/the_most_famous_historical_figure_born_each/), using an algorithmic measure of 'fame' based on each figure's English-language Wikipedia page (a combination of article length, number of revisions and pageviews). By far the most common feedback I got was about the strong (and expected) Anglo-Saxon bias inherent in using English Wikipedia. The most glaring example of this was the appearance in the list of some lesser-known US presidents (Van Buren, Buchanan, Grant) at the expense of more famous international figures.

To counterbalance this, I decided to also analyse a number of other large Wikipedias: **French**, **German**, **Spanish**, **Russian**, **Japanese** and **Chinese**. I originally planned to do Arabic too, but being a fair bit smaller than the others it seemed more susceptible to random noise. Rather than scraping new names for each Wikipedia I just reanalysed the names I scraped from the English Wikipedia (using Wikidata to find the corresponding non-English articles), my reasoning being that anyone famous enough to top a decade internationally should at least have a Wikipedia entry in English. To save time I also stopped at 1900 (this sub's 20-year-rule made the 20th century births mostly arbitrary anyway).

**Results**

A comparison of the **[most famous person born each century](http://tinyimg.io/i/mqvpCbp.png)** in different languages nicely shows the various biases (e.g. Goethe/Washington/Napoleon/Bolivar/Pushkin topping their respective languages in the 1700s). The Japanese and Chinese columns also highlight the huge Western bias in the European-language Wikipedias.

An **[updated decade graphic that takes all the languages into account](http://tinyimg.io/i/GMlV3gK.jpg)** also seems a definite improvement. While 71 of the 90 decade-toppers were unchanged from before, the 19 changes are mostly improvements: (old winner on left, new winner on right)

- 1890s: Dwight Eisenhower → Mao Zedong
- 1850s: Teddy Roosevelt → Vincent Van Gogh
- 1820s: Ulysses S. Grant → Fyodor Dostoyevsky
- 1790s: James Buchanan → Alexander Pushkin
- 1780s: Martin Van Buren → Simón Bolívar
- 1750s: Alexander Hamilton → Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
- 1620s: Blaise Pascal → Molière
- 1590s: Oliver Cromwell → René Descartes
- 1570s: Guy Fawkes → Johannes Kepler
- 1550s: Walter Raleigh → Henry IV of France
- 1500s: Anne Bolyen → Charles V
- 1400s: Skanderbeg → Gilles de Rais
- 1380s: Henry V → Donatello
- 1350s: Owain Glyndŵr → Dmitry Donskoy
- 1320s: John Wycliffe → Hongwu Emperor
- 1240s: Eleanor of Castile → Pope John XXII
- 1190s: Anthony of Padua → Frederick II
- 1140s: Nizami Ganjavi → Minamoto no Yoritomo
- 1110s: Bhaskara II → Manuel I Komnenos

**Update**

As suggested by /u/haveamission, here's **[yet another version](http://tinyimg.io/i/NwNB9ly.jpg)** with the various Wikipedia metrics  normalised to avoid weighting the English Wikipedia higher on account of its greater popularity. The most obvious change is the higher number of French and HRE monarchs and mostly Italian artists.

**Update #2**

For a list of the top 250 people in the combined list, regardless of birth date, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6zmmto/the_most_famous_historical_figures_of_the_second/dmxuw1x/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6zmmto/the_most_famous_historical_figures_of_the_second/dmxuwo0/). These use the non-normalised data so still contains some bias towards Anglo-Saxon figures."

I have an 8mm Mauser that I made the mistake of firing one time without earplugs and my ears rang for a long time- and that's an example of a typical rifle that there would have been dozens of in a firefight, not to mention explosions, etc.

We've all seen the movies where guys have a firefight and then have low-voiced conversations afterward, is that all BS? Those guys couldn't have been able to hear anything.

Flight controllers in Houston watched proudly – and anxiously -- from the Apollo Mission Control Room, a National Historic Landmark. Now, that room from which the Apollo missions were

The restoration team included representatives of the Apollo Mission Control teams that supported astronauts on their missions. These individuals ensured the authenticity of the control room and the artifacts inside – some being original artifacts that were cleaned and restored, such as the control consoles
 and displays, or items which have been recreated based on original samples.

When I can't sleep, I go to Youtube and click on an audiobook recording of the epic and listen to it while trying to fall asleep. I think it is the fact that the story is so old is what is fascinating. Every time I listen to the story, it sends chills up my spine. The reason why it is so chilling for me because it is 4,000 years old. This story was told and first recorded about 4,000 years ago and I feel like it gives us a small window to look through and see what the Sumerians believed in and what these ancient and mysterious people thought about life and death.


I also enjoy the epic a lot because the moral of the story is really good. For those that have not read/heard the story, the moral of the story is essentially ""we are all mortal and are going to die one day"". The inevitability of death. For someone like me who is not religious in the slightest, I am terrified of death. I have no idea what happens after we die. That is why I love this story so much.


So, what is your favorite old story/epic from history? Is ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"" the oldest story out there that we know of ? Are there any other older stories?


Here is a great 14 minute video summarizing the epic for those that don't want to read or listen to the whole epic:

EDIT: I didn't think so many people would be interested in this! For those that are wondering which audiobook I listen to, this is the one that I think is the best. It is narrated by Richard Pasco. His voice is gold:

6jdtcn,Why did US rebuild Japan after WW2?,4902,0.87,1093,2017-06-25 16:43:52,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6jdtcn/why_did_us_rebuild_japan_after_ww2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6jdtcn/why_did_us_rebuild_japan_after_ww2/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,,False,"From what I gather so far, there are two main reasons. But I'm still not sure the motivation of US that they did that post-ww2.

One is the rising communist force in Japan makes that US had to convert this country to a capitalist country. 

Two is reinstalling the government to a more western/US like module can be in more favor of US and not letting history of Nazi Germany happen again. The sanctions and punishments after WW1 are the main reason that caused Nazi party came to power, so I think it's a reasonable thing to prevent Japan becoming a second Nazi. 

But mostly the decisions were made by General MacArthur, he is the ultimate authority that drew a modern Japan. There were wartime conferences that dictate how the future of Japan should be, but ultimately it falls back to US's hands. 

And one thing needs notice is that US had fought a war with Japan for least 4 years, and it was direct engagement. While US was lending supplies and other arms through Atlantic, there were indirect engagements with Nazi Germany's submarines. And only in 1944, in D-Day, US had took part into the European theatre and opened western front. 

So a country that was warring with you for least 4 years and you agree to help the country reborn? This kind of looks absurd to me, added that what Germany had become after WW2. I feel like Japan was way more better treated. 

Thoughts? 

EDIT: Thanks for the incomes guys! Really appreciate what you have taught me. And yes, my mistake, US had direct land engagements in European Theatre against Axis power before D-Day. First entrance would be Operation Husky, invading Axis controlled Italian island of Sicily. And before this, US had first entered the west theatre (direct land engagements) in Operation Torch, November 1942, and later the North Africa Campaign, besides the submarine war in Atlantic."

But, I'm curious if there was any plan to deal with the 13,000+ paratroopers that were dropped into Normandy.  Obviously, they wouldn't be able to link up with the soldiers from the beach if they never made it off the beach.  So was there any plan to support the paratroopers or evacuate them somehow from France?  Or was there any plan to meet up with the Resistance?  Were they to just group up and take as many Germans with them as they could?  That seems like a lot of highly trained troops to lose in a day.

Thanks for any help.

[Washington's letter to Jefferson](https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Correspondent%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20Correspondent%3A%22Washington%2C%20George%22%20Author%3A%22Washington%2C%20George%22%20Recipient%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20Period%3A%22Washington%20Presidency%22&s=1111311113&r=172). Relavent section begins on the 5th paragraph (""How unfortunate..."") 

[Jefferson's response to Washington](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-11-02-0049). Relavent section begins on the 2nd paragraph (""I now take the liberty..."").

[Washington's letter to Hamilton](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-11-02-0015). Relevant section begins on the 2nd paragraph (""Differences in political opinions..."").

[Hamilton's response to Washington](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-11-02-0047). Relavant section begins on the 1st paragraph.

If you want to try to read it in their own original handwriting, the Library of Congress has it all online. Here is [1st](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw2.029/?sp=111) letter, the [2nd](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mtj1.016_1102_1113/?sp=1) letter, the [3rd](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw4.102_0472_0474/?sp=1) letter, and the [4th](https://www.loc.gov/resource/mgw4.102_0561_0566/?sp=1) letter

Its amazing how well written they all are. A guy like Washington was almost completely uneducated compared to the other founders (something he was very insecure about), yet his writing is amazingly articulate and thoughtful. However, Jefferson is clearly the superior writer. The way he crafts sentences is just different. So unique and flowery. The historian Richard Brookhiser has a great way of contrasting [the rhetorical styles of Jefferson and Hamilton.](https://youtu.be/AXHjsK-q0kU?t=18m7s) It's no accident that his Declaration of Independence has inspired or been copied by many other declarations around the world ([source](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/armitage/files/sahj.pdf?m=1360039786)).

The Axis powers were only obliged to help each other when one of their members was *attacked* by a foreign power, not if they initiate. This is why Japan *didn't* join the German war against the Soviet Union.

Moreover, Japan never even informed the Germans that they were planning to attack Pearl Harbor. Hitler found out the same time the rest of the world did.

Lastly, the Germans didn't ask Japan to join the war against the Soviets as a pre-condition to their declaration of war against the US.

The most common explanation I hear is that Hitler believed FDR was going to declare war anyway, so he figured he might as well do the honors himself.

I personally don't buy this theory. Hitler was not a stupid man, especially not in 1941. There was nothing to be gained from Germany declaring war before the US did. 

Germany's DOW against the US wasn't followed by any substantial escalation in the war in Atlantic either. It doesn't seem like the Germans weren't planning to gain anything from taking the gloves off against the US.

Of all the major decisions of WWII, this is the one I simply don't understand the rationale behind."

It's exam season! Essays are due and, *oh shit*, deadlines have snuck up on you. We've all been there. However, we will not be approving your posts asking for help with homework, paper writing, or exam questions. This isn't new, but desperation seems to be driving people to try.

If you need help with your studies, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. They won't do it for you, but they can point you in the right direction.

When we've made these reminders in the past, several people have asked for clarification or stated they don't understand why we have such a policy. In general, it comes down to two main reasons:
 
###  Homework help doesn't generate a lot of discussion. They're usually very specific questions that are really only asked as part of homework. 


If in serious numbers (and around this time of year, we're looking at dozens a day) they tend to make the subreddit less attractive for the community in general. Some people might still wonder ""but what is the harm? People can just not respond"". Which is partially correct, we have one factor that makes it a bit more difficult here. 

***Scale***. 

We have roughly 2-3 million unique visitors per month in this subreddit. The sort of homework questions we are talking about are the ""drive-by"" kind of questions. Often very simple, not very engaging or interesting for the rest of the community. If allowed though they tend to flood the subreddit which will drown out other, better, threads.


### Part of doing homework/research is applying and practicing the skills required for understanding and working with history. 

Asking people directly in /r/history defeats that very purpose. In many cases it is plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence, and anti-cheating software *does* scan reddit for similarities.

In those cases /r/HomeworkHelp is simply the better subreddit, as it focuses on the process of doing it properly. 

##### We have less of an issue if someone has done all/some of the below *before* they try to get strangers on the internet to do their work for them:

* Speak to your teacher/lecturer/professor. Attend their office hours or send them an email.
* The recommended reading list for your course should point you in the right direction.
* Check out the book lists [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist) or over on [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). 
* Google.


We can apply discretion for people who have already done their research, list what they have found and how they have found it and then, for example, asks if there are more places or ways they can find additional information. But simply copying out the essay question verbatim, rewording an essay prompt, or adding ""This is due tomorrow pls help"" will just get removed.

Thanks everyone! And good luck with your studies!

**P.S. We are always recruiting for the mod team, and I promise there's more to the role than homework questions! If you're interested follow [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application#mod2).**"

Why was there no transmission between the Vikings and the Native Americans, or the Inuit Tribes in Greenland?  Shouldn't Viking colonization have caused similar epidemics as when the Spanish first came?  If this happened, shouldn't the natives then had immunity (or at least resistance) to at least some of the diseases from the old world?

&#x200B;

Does anyone knows how the story continues? I was wondering about how did that episode end, since not only the guy stepped in front of the tanks but he aswell climbed it and all. Was he prisioned, killed, did he escape or what?  


If you're not related to the episode I mention, here's the astonishing video recordered the 5th of June 1989

9a0uaq,"My great-great uncle was West Virginia's only flying ace, and has a stained glass window overlooking the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey. It is a fascinating story, I'll include it in the comments below.",4707,0.93,173,2018-08-25 01:52:18,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9a0uaq/my_greatgreat_uncle_was_west_virginias_only/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/9a0uaq/my_greatgreat_uncle_was_west_virginias_only/,self.history,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Louis Bennett Jr. was born September 22, 1894 in Weston, West Virginia. At age 12, he built a car and a motorcycle, he drove the car across the country when he was just 16 years old. Louis enrolled at Yale in 1913 and graduated in 1917, while attending, he learned to fly at a nearby Aero Club. Naturally, this inclination towards mechanics led him from automobiles and motorcycles to airplanes. He recognized early on that aviation was going to play a heavy role both in the future of travel but also during wartime. He petitioned the Governor for assistance and funding in forming a flying corps, and with the help of his family, he created the the West Virginia Flying Corps in Beech Bottom. Around the same time he started an airplane manufacturing facility, the West Virginia Aircraft company, and tried to get the Flying Corps to achieve military status, when the corps wasn't accepted, Louis decided to enlist in the British Royal Flying Corps in Toronto, Canada in October of 1917. He had accomplished all of this and was only 23 years old. 

After some training, Louis was assigned to a squadron performing home defense in England before he petitioned for reassignment on the front line. He was reassigned to northern France and began flying in an S.E.5a aircraft in July of 1918. Louis recognized the value of shooting down enemy observation balloons, the balloons were strategic in the enemy's ability to use the aerial view for directing orders and defense. In the process of 25 flights, Louis shot down 9 balloons and 3 enemy aircraft. He became a flying ace, in fact West Virginia's only flying ace of World War I. Then on August 24, 1918, just over a month after he began fighting, Louis was shooting down balloons when his airplane was hit by anti-aircraft guns defending the balloons from below. His plane went down and Louis was fatally injured, the Germans pulled him from the plane and took him to the nearby field hospital, where he succumbed to his wounds. 

Due to the fact that he was an American, the Royal Flying Corps didn't posthumously award him, nor did the Americans as he was flying for the British. Thus, his mother took it upon herself to memorialize her son. Sallie Maxwell Bennett flew overseas to Wavrin, France where he was buried under the guise of being a reporter, as the government would not let a grieving mother come into the country because it could open a floodgate. So, Sallie claimed to be a reporter and then after some searching was able to find Louis' grave and identify him by the Yale graduation ring on his finger. She exhumed his body and had it buried in the family plot in Weston. Then to properly memorialize his actions, she had Saint Martins Church reconstructed in Wavrin, France in 1919 and had a plaque placed for her son. She then donated a large tapestry in his name to St. Thomas church in New York City where she had spent much time. While visiting Westminster Abbey for an event to bestow the Medal of Honor to the British Unknown Warrior, she noted the window above the tomb. Shortly following, Sallie wrote to the Dean asking to donate a new stained glass window to memorialize her son and the Royal Flying Corps. Today, one can visit the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior in the Westminster Abbey and see both Louis Bennett Jr., as well as the West Virginia state seal providing the light onto the tomb. She had a large statue erected of Louis with aviator wings and gave it to Wheeling's military institute Linsly in 1925. The family home was donated to the county for a public library in memory of Louis Bennett Jr. as well as Louis Bennett Sr. 

Now, 100 years later, I have a son named after him and am going to visit his grave and home/library tomorrow for the first time! If anyone is interested I'll take some pictures."

My latest book, The Splendid and the Vile, takes place during Churchill’s first year as prime minister, May 10, 1940, to May 10, 1941, and seeks to answer the question, how on earth did he, his family, and his “Secret Circle” of advisors manage to endure the German air war against Britain, which unfolded during that 12-month period. In these tense times of ours, I for one found a certain solace in learning how Churchill confronted that unfathomable challenge and how along the way he taught the British public the art of being fearless.

Additionally (college) papers are also considered homework, for which the below reasoning goes even more. 

If you need help with your studies, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. They won't do it for you, but they can point you in the right direction.

When we've made these reminders in the past, several people have asked for clarification or stated they don't understand why we have such a policy. In general, it comes down to two main reasons:
 
###  Homework help doesn't generate a lot of discussion. They're usually very specific questions that are really only asked as part of homework. 


If in serious numbers (and around this time of year, we're looking at dozens a day) they tend to make the subreddit less attractive for the community in general. Some people might still wonder ""but what is the harm? People can just not respond"". Which is partially correct, we have one factor that makes it a bit more difficult here. 

***Scale***. 

We have roughly 2-3 million unique visitors per month in this subreddit. The sort of homework questions we are talking about are the ""drive-by"" kind of questions. Often very simple, not very engaging or interesting for the rest of the community. If allowed though they tend to flood the subreddit which will drown out other, better, threads.


### Part of doing homework/research is applying and practicing the skills required for understanding and working with history. 

Asking people directly in /r/history defeats that very purpose. In many cases it is plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence, and anti-cheating software *does* scan reddit for similarities.

In those cases /r/HomeworkHelp is simply the better subreddit, as it focuses on the process of doing it properly. 

##### We have less of an issue if someone has done all/some of the below *before* they try to get strangers on the internet to do their work for them:

* Speak to your teacher/lecturer/professor. Attend their office hours or send them an email.
* The recommended reading list for your course should point you in the right direction.
* Check out the book lists [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist) or over on [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). 
* Google.
* And as suggested in the comments, old school reaching out to your librarian for help with resources is also a very valid option. Certainly for college students with a library on campus!

We can apply discretion for people who have already done their research, list what they have found and how they have found it and then, for example, asks if there are more places or ways they can find additional information. But simply copying out the essay question verbatim, rewording an essay prompt, or adding ""This is due tomorrow pls help"" will just get removed.

Thanks everyone! And good luck with your studies!"
rn3fg1,"My Uncle was a Tunnel Rat in Vietnam and has agreed to do an interview with me in the next 2 days, I need help finding the right questions to ask him.",4609,0.96,324,2021-12-24 01:05:06,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/rn3fg1/my_uncle_was_a_tunnel_rat_in_vietnam_and_has/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/rn3fg1/my_uncle_was_a_tunnel_rat_in_vietnam_and_has/,self.history,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I had posted about this in r/AskHistorians and they provided me with plenty of helpful resources in how to go about conducting the interview. What I am still struggling with is finding the right questions to ask. I don’t want to bring up anything too traumatizing for him but I also want to be able to figure out the stuff he did differently than other individuals in order to survive such a high attrition rate job. Such as equipment to individual mannerisms.
 If anyone would be interested in having a question answered from my uncle please comment it below and I can ask

Update: hello everyone! I have just finished up my first interview with my uncle a few minutes ago, we talked for about an hour and 20 minutes just about pretty much everything from before he was drafted and how that made him feel then onto his travels from the states to Vietnam, his initial experience in Vietnam such as what he was doing when he got there. From there we started to talk about Him being moved out to the “boondocks” with his unit and then becoming a tunnel rat. 

We then talked about equipment,training and initial feelings of the job. 
- what would be found in the tunnels
- booby traps (the different types)(how they go about finding them)
- time spent in tunnels and what would be a reason he wouldn’t continue 
-injuries 

We talked about a lot! And I was sure to record everything. My plan from here is to take everything we talked about and get a more detailed list of what I want to get more information about.
At the end of our talk today he said he would like to talk more and would tell me “whatever” I wanted to know so I think the plan is to try and do this once a week so I can get as much information about him as possible 
I would love to be able to share everything I find out with everyone! I just have to find out the best way to do that

I received some really great advice from both here and r/AskHistorians one piece of advice I got that really helped this whole process a lot is, “when there is silence don’t speak and wait for the interviewee to continue” 
That piece of advice really helped get a lot more information than I thought was possible and is an area I need to improve in for next time because I can tell there was a lot more that my Uncle wanted to say before I sometimes asked the next question 

This post gained much more attention Than I initially expected and I am truly thankful for everybody’s input and advice, I do not know what I am doing when it comes to interviewing but am learning so much! I want to be able to share the material that I learn and want to be sure I do that in the correct way!"

I'm interested in how these accents evolved over time. Was it due to the mix of Irish, Scottish and Welsh colonialists? Or is there some other reason?

Edit: Thank you all for your replies. I think the consensus may be that it is the English who changed their accents over time since ~1700s-1800s. I've always been interested in linguistics, particularly dialects and accents. As an Australian I have a fairly good idea of where our accents diverted from the British and Irish (yes, there are in fact different Aussie accents). This was mostly due to the climate we had to endure after colonisation. 

I honestly didn't expect this post to get much interest so thank heaps, mates.

Edit 2: Diverted NOT deserted. Damn you, mobile!

Edit 3: I just realised that the 1971 Disney version of Robin Hood makes a little more sense now  (not that I didn't enjoy the honky tonk soundtrack)

Blitzkrieg overran the western-most front of the Maginot Line.

Why on earth would the winning countries of The Great War make life so untenable that adjacent countries were preparing for another attack?  I think back to how the US helped rebuild Europe after WWII and didn't make the same mistake.

Just ignorance and greed?

4xy77e,Is it possible that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is the most influential assassination in history?,4478,0.88,751,2016-08-16 12:26:07,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4xy77e/is_it_possible_that_the_assassination_of_archduke/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/4xy77e/is_it_possible_that_the_assassination_of_archduke/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,,False,"So I was thinking about things that I had learned about history recently, and was thinking about lots of threats that we've faced. Specifically I was thinking about WWI and how that's affected our world. WWI is one of the main reasons WWII happened, as well as one of the destabilizing factors of the Middle East (The Ottoman Empire fell as a result of WWI, which caused the middle east to be split in ways contrary to culture and things like that), and one of the main reasons that Russia turned communist.

WWI caused Germany to become a shell of it's former self. Hitler, and Nazism in general, promised to bring Germany back, which they did before warring with everyone and killing people for being Jewish, and it's very unlikely that WWII would have happened if WWI hadn't happened. In fact, I'd guess that Fascism would still exist, and would probably do better if WWII hadn't happened.

Then we move on to Russia not turning communist. There were two revolutions, the first one was Democratic and existed for a very short period before the Bolsheviks took over. One of the main reasons the Bolsheviks took over was that the Democratic government wanted to stay in WWI, whereas the majority of people didn't. The Bolsheviks became popular, in part, as a result of WWI as well. and it seems that had WWI not happened, Russia would have become a Democratic Republic as opposed to a Communist Dictatorship

Now, we move on to WWII, in which Russia becomes more powerful, and America and Russia rise as the two main superpowers.

And even today it's affecting us. Radical Jihadis were propped up by the US government to block the Soviets. We created our own enemy. We didn't think ahead of time, so we riled up the extreme religious sects, and as a result, were still playing catch up with WWI.

Am I wrong in saying that the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is one of the single most influential assassinations in history?

Edit: Wow, my inbox is full! A lot of interesting answers in the comments, I just wanted to say, I am in no way an expert in history, I just am really interested. About the powderkeg politics in Europe at the time, WWI probably would have happened, but the timing of WWI was right when the Tsar wasn't popular in Russia, and was during the time that the Bolsheviks were getting really popular. It's possible that if WWI had happened 2 or 3 years later, that the Bolsheviks wouldn't have taken power and Russia would likely be Democratic by then, or Democratic as a result. The Ottomans probably would have fallen either way, but the Middle East being destabilized didn't cause radical jihadis to take power, that in conjunction with the Russians invading Afghanistan and us funding the Jihadis did.

Although, WWII might have still happened, albeit under different leadership because Hitler would likely have been killed, or Germany would have been one of the allies against a different power.

Edit2: I've gotten a lot of comments saying Jesus Christ was the most influential assassination in history. He's definitely the most influential _death_, but he was executed, not assassinated."

I understand that it might be a complicated answer and is potentially the result of a “perfect storm” of many different factors in different historical eras, but can someone attempt to explain to me, in very simple terms, how Britain’s dominance came about?

Anyway, her life is one of the most attested and studied during her time due to her trial and her prosecutors gathering any evidence to undo her. Her heroic conviction in her mission ending in martyrdom, it was unlike anything of the time, especially as a young woman of the time, I think. I do not doubt that she may not have been charged with commanding troops in much, if any, degree but she came at a time dear to her nation and I do not think it can be ever replicated in the same degree today.

I've lived in Chicago my entire life. From what I've understood we had gang problems for almost a century, from Al Capone to Vicelords.

As you can guess there's sort of a romanticization of criminal organization. I've been skeptical of most theories and ideas, but one stuck out to me as plausible.

There was a persistent idea that sometime during the industrial revolution, when the financial gap was at its widest, gangs, mafia and Sydicates in general became a sort of citizens militia. Through organized crime protected mistreated workers, stole from the upper class and gave back to their communities and stood against/physically combat corrupt law enforcement. My parents even told me that Chicago gangs weren't as vicious 30 years ago like say if you were black and going to school regularly the gangs would explicitly not target you and even protect you from any bullies on occasion, they knew that harming other black people that go to school and college would harm our community in the long run. Then something happened along the way that made them more self centered in terms of goal.

The idea actually seems plausible to me. So was there ever a time when organized crime groups aided there communities and to put in D'n'd terms, seen as the chaotic good?

Why were wars like the American Revolution or the Napoleonic Wars fought with muskets, when it seems like longbowman could have created a much more effective field of fire? Given tactics of the era, it seems like pentupling an army's rate of fire would have had a huge effect in this regard.

1920 - roaring twenties

1930 - dirty thirties

1940 - WW2

1950 - uptight & conservative

1960 - overcompensate & hippies

The game portrays the West as a changing, but still rather “wild” West. Everything that embodies the Old West is still very present in the more rural areas of the West according to the game. 

I would like to know how accurate the Red Dead Redemption 2 actually is in portraying this time period. Was the West (In some areas) still full of cowboys and outlaws during the 1890s and early 1900s? Or was the theme of the Wild West already mostly gone by this time?

I was looking for some answers yesterday, and didn't get too far with what I could find. It seems there are a couple theories: 1) that humans traveled to the islands around 300 CE 2) other research shows that humans in fact came closer to 800 or 1200 CE. This raises even further questions, such as how did people get to the other Polynesian islands? If they were coming from the mainland in Asia, wouldn't Australia been closer and easier to navigate to than any islands out in the middle of the ocean? Were the first humans to settle on the islands in the Polynesian area more likely to be Aboriginal Australians or from the  Philippines or another Asian nation? It looks like the general theory is that the first humans were travelers were from Polynesia though. Who settled in Polynesia first?

In simple terms, my main question is:
Hawaii is waaaayyyy out in the middle of nowhere. And looking at the available technology, it seems like there is no way a raft/canoe/fishing vessel could have navigated the waters to reach Hawaii. Even if the boats were sufficient, sailors at the time would have had no idea there was anything even out there. I feel like in my mind, I am imaging a very large kayak structure heading out into open water and having to travel hundreds of miles before they would have even been close to reaching a tiny (in comparison to the rest of the ocean) chain of islands, that they had no idea was even there.

Please go easy on me, I’m very ill-knowledgeable about WWII history and war history in general. 

ORIGINAL POST:
I was just reading an article detailing some of the more heinous atrocities, and most of them involved the Imperial Army giving orders to retreat, leave cities, etc. Instead of obeying orders it seems like the troops went into a murderous frenzy, killing rampantly, bombing and destroying. 

I’ve read that many Japanese citizens & soldiers had been fed propaganda essentially portraying Allied forces as borderline demonic & psychotic foreigners who would commit every abuse possible if they came in contact with a Japanese person. 

Did this fuel them, or was there a sort of twisted idea of honor driving them to ‘go out like badass’ so to speak? I know very very little about WWII in general so maybe I’m missing some huge cultural element. 

TLDR; After surrender or orders to evacuate, the Japanese army dramatically increased abuse, murder & genocidal tactics. Why? "

What are your favourite underrated periods/civilisations?







Two of my favourites which are both overlooked in my view:

The Migration Age: The Folkswandering, the period where mass migrations across Europe coincided with and helped cause the fall of Rome, the settlement of England by Germanic tribes, the later part of the period has The Period of the Seven Kingdoms in England, the early Viking age, the violent and brutal christianisation of Northern Europe by Charlemagne etc.

My second choice would be the Achaemenid Empire, that is, the first Persian Empire. It is often only learnt about in the context of mainly learning about the Greeks, while Persia is doomed to play the role of the ""bad-guy"" because *some* Greek city States had very limited forms of Democracy. Persia had 55% of the world's entire population in its borders, and Slavery was illegal. It was the first Great Empire of the world, and the progenitor of much of Greek art and philosophy. Zoroaster may be considered one of the first true philosophers. In my view Persia at this time was an Empire of the calibre of Rome at its height, and yet the Empire is not well known outside of historical circles and plays second fiddle to the Greek city States despite being the much more important power during this period.


EDIT: Also some things which i was reminded about/learnt in this thread that I would like to put at the top so others can see them and learn too :) Timur/Tamerlane, Phoenicians, Mansa Musa, Aksum, Neolithic (pre celtic) UK, Lithuania (up until very late they were Romuva Pagan, very interesting to study an indigenous European religion), Vijayanagara Empire etc. Keep on learnin'!

Florida. 

There was no fervor for revolt in Florida because the colony was a British military garrison. Merchants and shop keepers, such as they were, relied on the British army, as did Florida’s cattle ranchers. They saw no reason to get all up in King George’s face.

Spain held Florida for almost three centuries total, whereas the British possessed Florida for only 20 years. That span of years, 1763 to 1783, fell at the time of the revolution and its buildup. The Treaty of Paris that settled the revolution returned Florida to Spain, which eventually gave it to the United States. That final move seemed inevitable, seeing as how Florida was dangling down there under Georgia all this time.

I’ve used the singular form, colony, but actually the British split Florida into two colonies. East Florida has its capital in St. Augustine, West Florida’s in Pensacola. The western boundary of West Florida reached to the Mississippi River.

They were two of the four colonies to remain loyal to George. The other two were in Canada."
5klbnw,Full WW1 battle uniform and gear.,4224,0.9,239,2016-12-28 00:17:40,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5klbnw/full_ww1_battle_uniform_and_gear/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5klbnw/full_ww1_battle_uniform_and_gear/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,,False,"Hello, I think you all may be interested in this part of my collection.

This is WW1 guy, He has a full ww1 infantry setup execpt for the BAR belt on his sholder and the fact that I have a cavalry belt with 1911 holster instead of the standard infantry belt (The real diffrence is no 1911 magazine pouch or space for the holster on the normal infantry belt).

The backpack is full of stuff as well, such as the food tins and personal effects, I can take pictures of the interior later if anyone is interested (currently at work). I also have a WW1 shelter half with pegs, poll and correct backpack parts.

[Front, with old mask](http://imgur.com/R0AJeeu)

[New mask](http://imgur.com/BWh5DJs)

[Inside of new mask](http://imgur.com/vu0KGAk)

[The bits that came with the mask](http://i.imgur.com/kfvJFdL.jpg) The round tin housed the cloth and paste tube, both of which for cleaning and defogging the mask's glass eyeholes. The other card is a 'service check' card that also has items to repair the mask, some kind of patches. The black bit is the bladder of the mask and would have originally been attached between the metal housing at the bottom by the hose, but 100 years does not bold well for rubber, and thus it sits at the bottom of the gasmasks' bag.

[Helmet Liner](http://imgur.com/hbsM2Hg) (surprisingly comfortable compared to modern and ww2-1980's helmets.)

[Back](http://imgur.com/iWuX3ek) you can see the sholve, part of the 1903 bayonet and part of the pratice rifle I keep on him here.

[Bolo, 1917 trench knife and Trench parascope](http://imgur.com/rbOBJVT) some of his gear.

[My 1903(and other firearms) ](http://imgur.com/PcROddP) The very bottom rifle is my 1903, it is a 1943 dated rifle that I have set up to look like what it would have in ww1. It has the correct ww1 stock, forend and sights. This was a sporterized rifle that has been restored. It also has the M1903 bayonet on it, that bayonet is dated 1912 iirc.

As I said, after work if anyone is interested I can take the backpack off and delve into the personal kit and other items that a ww1 soldier would have carried. The backpacks themselves are the same as ww2 versions as they used the same backpack into the korean war, as well as more or less the same items (though the food tins I believe were phased out after ww1)

Edit 1: Just got home, will be adding more pictures soonish.

Edit 2: Just finished taking pictures, holy shit how am I going to get this all back into ww1 guy, challenge accepted.

Here is a [sneak peak](http://i.imgur.com/i0Rc3QX.jpg). Gonna be a bit while the photos upload.

Edit 3: The big edit. Do note, I tried to add a bit of humor to this, I don't know if it will be good or fail (I like to think it will be good lol) so bear with me if you hate it. Also im kinda a shitty photographer.

Luckily I have enough [screens](http://i.imgur.com/mxUBHGe.jpg) to deal with this, still need more though.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/SH7degG.jpg) is basicly everything ww1 I own, execpt a few pistols and a few shells.

So I will start [here](http://i.imgur.com/Bg3oxac.jpg) with my interogation of ww1 guy, What do you hold in your deseptivly small bagage, and may I add, it is fairly [light](http://i.imgur.com/CrvBof8.jpg) at roughly [40 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/wrQZRBK.jpg) (or my scale is shit, but that felt about right).

So, ww1 guy was in the [86th Black Hawk Infantry](http://imgur.com/CgWhvzw) of the [US Army](http://imgur.com/k3b4ExH) as a [Artilleryman](http://imgur.com/zX95U0I) wich fits my collection perfectly, I love [(non working) bombs](http://i.imgur.com/hpOoTfM.jpg).

Here is ww1 guy [without](http://imgur.com/YmtSQiL) his backpack and gear, just the bare bones [clothing](http://i.imgur.com/ARIBed2.jpg). 

Next are the [boots](http://imgur.com/rAQx1zs), now these are ww1 boots however they are officers boots. Good luck finding ww1 boots if you ever do look for them, they often were used by the soldiers after the war as work boots until they wore out. My set of boots has many holes in them including one in the soul.

Now onto the gear, I have way more things hanging off this guy to the point where A, my maniquin may some day collapse in the night scaring the shit out of me, and B, every single ring on the belt has somthing on it and many of the things only have 1 of the 2 needed to actually be attached.

[here](http://imgur.com/vXPuPDV) are [a](http://imgur.com/OI3eqfs) bunch [of](http://imgur.com/CmjPzOn) pics [with](http://imgur.com/gPTcsQ5) ww1 [guy](http://imgur.com/7dMQeJ8) all set up.

[This](http://imgur.com/xUkGqG7) is the backpack with [Everything](http://i.imgur.com/GcrsB9D.jpg) (man, that photo was a total failure, I regret that I have put everything back, sorry) that hangs taken off of it, makes it quite a bit easier to push about my floor while I open it up.

[This](http://imgur.com/vebwxbT) is the [quick detach system](http://imgur.com/aPn1UXU) for our backpacks from ww1 all the way to korea, so you can dump your shelter half without losing the rest of your gear to make it easier to move about in a hurry. I would pull the strap but it's 100 year old leather and I really don't want to mess it up.

[Next](http://imgur.com/ciWw2ZI) is the shelter half and blanket. along with the [wooden poll](http://imgur.com/Vlne5Ve) and one of the 3 (4) steaks wrapped up inside. The others (I actually learned today that I have 4 stakes, I honestly don't know if I should ahve 4 or only 3, oh well 4 it is now.) are inside the backpack, which is where this 4th one now lives along with the poll, because they fell out since apparently I did not wrap it back up tight enough.

A quick aside, here is [looking through](http://imgur.com/ND5OD1w) the [trench periscope](http://i.imgur.com/rbOBJVT.jpg)

Now onto the backpack itself.

What do we have [here](http://imgur.com/C371G3B)? Why the [Mess kit and silverware](http://imgur.com/HvYh2sF) nicely stoed away.

It would truly suck to have [this](http://imgur.com/77LXdG6) as your only plate, bowl and silverware.

How bout a [drink](http://imgur.com/jPS21J9)? Cup and canteen.

Now that we are though the mess pouch, lets open the [pack itself](http://imgur.com/jHG2aPY). First thing is a nice little [oil lamp](http://imgur.com/V83kFvY).

Next, the rest of the [steaks](http://imgur.com/MY8fE17)

Now [both](http://imgur.com/d024vRz) of the [Food](http://imgur.com/mYL05Rh) [Tins](http://imgur.com/mmPrqUA) <- two pics here.

[Here](http://imgur.com/Q68Qyq2) are all of the food items that my ww1 guy carries.

Next, we have the first [personal](http://imgur.com/EKKdzbv) kit [thingy](http://imgur.com/4rHddNg) that probably held toilitries or other small cleaning devices. I am honestly not really sure what it is, but its period, and it has a eagle on the button, so in the pack it went.

Lastly, a [shoe shine kit](http://imgur.com/cICs3Gr) pouch. its empty.

Now that the backpack is done, Here is his [real weapon and training weapon](http://imgur.com/L0fPGnb).

My [1903](http://imgur.com/5Z571gV) has a ww1 (roughly 1918) serial number and a 1944 dated barrel. The [sights](http://imgur.com/o6osA78) should be true to ww1 however.

And because that one picture was an epic failure, [have](http://imgur.com/eNNFflM) two [older](http://imgur.com/rbOBJVT) pictures with some of the items in them.

Everything in my post is original WW1 era gear, most of it is dated between 1912 to 1918 (atleast for what is dated, not much honestly is)

I mentioned in a throwaway comment on another sub that I had a 212 year old book with some interesting stuff in it. Loads of people requested to see it so here goes.

I bought it in a cool old second hand shop in NZ in around 2007, unfortunately the shop was later destroyed by an earthquake.

The book is by John Pinkerton, who was a bit of a Scottish renaissance man, and unfortunately also a bit of a racist. One of the most interesting things about the book is that there are 16 pages ripped out in the section on West Africa, before the abolition of slavery in Great Britain. Unfortunately it seems there were maps included too that have been ripped out.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pinkerton

The timeframe was interesting. The Napoleonic wars were raging, the USA was only 30 years Australia and New Zealand had just been colonised.

There is lots of good stuff in there but I only had a few hours to work with, and can't post the whole book.


EDIT: For people who are really interested: Rare book guru u/Corgy has found a full scan of the exact same version as mine. Thanks!

Please excuse my bad english.
A quick Wikipedia search on the victorian era suggests that those were times of prosperity and growth in British history : 

*""The Victorian era of British history was the period of Queen Victoria's reign from 20 June 1837 until her death, on 22 January 1901. It was a long period of peace, prosperity, refined sensibilities and national self-confidence for Britain.""*

In movies , TV and video games ( Penny Dreadfull, Bloodborne and many other references .. ) it is always seen as a very dark era ?

Is there a specific reason for this or am I just reading/watching the wrong stuff ?

6axrak,A review on the historical accuracy of Deadliest Warrior: Persian Immortal versus Celtic Warrior,4158,0.89,482,2017-05-13 18:44:03,history,18183116,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6axrak/a_review_on_the_historical_accuracy_of_deadliest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6axrak/a_review_on_the_historical_accuracy_of_deadliest/,self.history,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Today I am reviewing selected Deadliest Warrior, Season 2 - Episode 8: Persian Immortal Versus Celtic Warrior:

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51lthc

My imaginary bottle of Canadian Club is handy and I am ready to start.

0.05: Badhistory 5 seconds in! The narrator calls the Celt a savage barbarian. First, that applies only to those from Scotland. Second, the Celts had complex social and religious structures such as ruling councils and assemblies where free citizens could take part in government, as well as refined artistic traditions and a strong sense of loyalty to their aristocratic patrons or officials. There was nothing barbaric or savage about them. DRINK!

0.10: That maille looks way to anachronistic. The maille used in the time period would have looked like this:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/9e/b7/ae9eb779a29b8d595fdec6c85de740ea.jpg

The maille displayed looks more medieval:

http://www.heavenlyswords.com/images/T/Large_Medieval_Crusader_Knight_Haubergeon_01.jpg

DRINK!

1.21: The narrator states the Celts were the ancestors of the Scottish and Irish clans. He also leaves out they were the ancestors of the French, English, Bretons and Welsh, as well as a large proportion of the Spanish and North Italian population. One drink for the overly narrow statement. DRINK!

1.22: The ""stats"" of the Celtic warrior don't mention they would wear maille. DRINK!

1.23: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

1.27: Metal helmet with nose-guard many centuries before they became common. DRINK!

1.33: Two errors here. First, the narrator calls the Persian Immortal a special-ops killer. Disregarding the fact that the Immortals were most likely called Companions (Anûšiya as opposed to Anauša), the Immortals were an army of full-time troops intended to fight in open battle, not a small group of men who would operate behind enemy lines. Next, the ""stats"" list them as having a wicker shield, as opposed to a wooden shield that a Persian professional unit would usually possess. Wicker shields were employed to form a shield wall, and not for guard duty. DRINK! 

2.40: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!
2.47: MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

2.52: Time to roll out the ""experts"". The first is Francis Brebner. Extraordinarily fit looking guy and a participant in Highland games, he may have the athletic ability but has no background in martial-arts or experimental archaeology. DRINK!

3.17: The next person is Spencer Dinnean, whom I could find absolutely no information about. DRINK!

3.42: The narrator says the Celts were the first iron-workers in Europe and helped usher in the Iron Age. Uh, no. That would be the Greeks, and the Iron-Age was transmitted from the Middle-East, not heralded by the Celts. DRINK!

3.46: The narrator says that iron helped the Celts conquer much of Europe. Again, no. Celtic culture was spread through a variety of methods. Migration seems to be the most attested to within written sources, but trade and acculturation to a new elite may have also been methods. DRINK!

3.59: The Celtic noble is not wearing maille. DRINK!

4.14: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELD! DRINK!

4.51: The first Iranian expert is Ardeshir ""Bitches be nothing next to sharp akinakes"" Radpour. Now we are getting somewhere! Mr Radpor is a trained rider, martial-artist and experimental archaeologist. He is also a metal smith and has crafted numerous weapons and armour. His website can be found here:

http://www.radpour.com/

This has earned The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm).

5.02: Mr Radpour called the Immortals special-forces. The ByzantineBasileus Seal of Approval (tm) withdrawn. Also, DRINK!

5.17: The next individual is Cyrus Zahiri, also known as Cyrus James, who appears to be only an actor and occasional film crewmen. DRINK!

5.28: The shape of the shields here is correct, but they are held in the wrong manner. They are held horizontally rather than vertically, meaning the warriors lose the protection offered to their lower and upper bodies. DRINK!

5.59: The Immortals were infantry, and did not use chariots. DRINK!

5.52: The narrator says the Persian scythed chariot would destroy any resistance. Most of the accounts of scythed chariots describe them as total failures when facing troops who were prepared for them. DRINK!

6.09: The narrator states that the Immortals numbered ten thousand. This figure comes from Herodotus, but I personally doubt his description is accurate. I would propose that the ""Immortals"" where a guard unit of 1000 men with golden apples on their spears. The amount of 10,000 should perhaps refer to the standing palace regiments as a whole, who were called the Companions.

6.31: HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

6.46: STILL MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING! DRINK!

7.03: The narrator calls the Celtic sword a long-sword, which was a specific weapon from the medieval period. DRINK!

7.10: Francis Brebner states the Celtic sword had a rounded point whilst holding a version of the weapon with a relatively narrow point. DRINK!

9.05: Francis swings at the armour instead of thrusting under the scales. DRINK!

10.17: Test is done against a bare head, whilst an Immortal would have been most likely been wearing a helmet. DRINK!

11.19: Narrator calls the Immortal a commando. DRINK!

12.15: The narrator says an ancient Celtic warrior would have had a burda, which was a club. I have never read about the burda being used by the ancient Celts, so I will count this as an error. DRINK!

13.19: This test proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a sharp iron point can penetrate flesh.

14.03: Francis suggest a leather belt as protection for a Celtic warrior rather than, you know, MAILLE! DRINK!

14.28: That belt looks less like a belt and more like a girdle. For when your warrior wants to look svelte on the battlefield!

14.59: I am sure a Celtic warrior would not just let you pull down his shield like that, especially with him holding it and trying to cut you in the spleen. DRINK!

16.48: ANOTHER OCCASION OF HOLLYWOOD DUAL-WIELDING!

17.17: MORE SHIELDS HELD INCORRECTLY IN A BATTLE-LINE! DRINK!

17.33: Not only are their shields held inproperly, they wield their spears in a manner that actually prevents them attacking with it! Double drink. DRINK! DRINK!

17.39: Sigh. More Hollywood Dual-Wielding. DRINK!

17.45: ""Coming up! Both sides thrust their most piercing weapons!"". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.

18.44: Francis states that Celtic spear-heads were wavy in shape. In reality they were leaf-shaped:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/69/e3/33/69e333085eb3cc9de09c629d1d449339.jpg

DRINK!

19.27: They are testing a Celtic spear by throwing it, rather than using it hand-to-hand. DRINK!

----

Rule 3: **No [historical negationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_negationism) or denialism**

We do not allow posts and comments about fringe hypotheses, false narratives, misunderstood or misrepresented history, genocide denial, and other disingenuous revisionism. They have proven to be magnets for those wanting to push a distortion of historic consensus and/or records. Engaging in historical negationism or denialism will result in a permanent ban.

----

TLDR: Historical negationism is more than not history, it is an attempt to negate history. Additionally, ""Just asking questions"" is one of the oldest tricks in the book, and we aren't going to fall for it.

----

So, we expect there are two big questions here.

1) Why disallow Historical Negationism? Won't it just be downvoted or shown to be wrong?

At its most basic, we don't allow it because it is more than simply not history, but an attempt to negate history and even in the best of circumstances, their presence in a discussion will result in a thread going far off-kilter as it becomes the dominating topic.

However, we are not blind to the fact that in quashing posts which advocate of such notions, we risk feeding them ammunition as they in-turn complain that we are ""suppressing the truth"". In an ideal world, every time a piece of Historical Negationism was posted in /r/History, a dozen learned scholars would immediately pounce and tear their ""argument"" apart point by point. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen. A lot of their ""arguments"" are constructed in a way that they seem very plausible, which means that often it indeed takes someone with above average knowledge about this particular subject to debunk them. On a userbase as large as ours this also means that we can't reasonably expect everyone to have that knowledge yet. Which in return means that sadly we too often see that it takes a while before Historical Negationism does receive the pushback it deserves. At which point the damage already has been done and the false information has been seeded. This is what people championing such views count on.

Even worse, often enough we see it getting upvoted as well before receiving any pushback, giving it an even greater impression of legitimacy, which in turn means that they get even more exposure. These upvotes originate from a variety of sources; outside brigades trying to push the subject, the earlier mentioned ignorance on a subject and reasons we don't understand ourselves (on a userbase of millions you will always have the group of people that for some reason seem to look for the contrarian view no matter if it is true or not).
So while we would perhaps prefer to see claims quickly and definitely countered, the mod team, which is made up of volunteers, simply don't have the time to do that for every such comment, nor can we reasonably expect that the wider userbase would be able to counter each one either. So in light of that, we would much prefer to see those comments simply removed rather than risk them stand uncontested.

Is that the right call in the big scheme of things? Who knows. But we do firmly believe that given the limited resources available to us, and our stated mission of keeping /r/history a place for real historical discussion, there is no reasonable alternative to deal with it.

2) So, why can't we ask questions about it?

Quite simply, we ban Historical Negationist and people naturally want to defend their causes. Such threads become more of a honeypot and shooting fish in a barrel doesn't really seem sporting.

Additionally, one of the major Negationist tactics is ""just asking questions"" as a round about way of pushing their agenda."

So did the allies have to give them some sort of therapy or rehabilitation to undo the years of brainwashing? I know there's some camps nowadays that former child soldiers from Africa are sent to so they get used to normal life. Was there anything similar for the Hitler Youth?

Edit: I was referring to the Hitler Youth that actually saw combat. There was over 8 million members total, however, not nearly as many saw combat. One example is the [12th SS Panzer Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_SS_Panzer_Division_Hitlerjugend) , who were known to be quite fanatic."

Or something more exciting? Even if they did do it, are they really happy just sitting in silence? Like, where's the basket weaving? Or the crochet? Why is it that the movies only show them just sitting around the fire in silence?

I guess I'm more just wondering why they sit in silence in a big room. Sometimes they whisper. But when they do, it's like everyone wants to know, and that baffles me.

Also, while we are at it. Why do people often stay at each others homes and do... nothing? Like, what does staying there in silence contribute to anything?

Edit: to everyone getting hung up on the silence bit. Its not the silence that confused me. Its that they do nothing. Literally. Staring into space. I guess I can never do that. I'll be writing, reading etc."

And just in case it isn't clear... I am not pro-Nazi, I was just thinking about how their soldiers were just soldiers, and I'm sure some of them did some rather heroic things that we don't see movies about or anything...

Edit: because people seem to think I am asking because I sympathize with Nazis... this is not the reason in the slightest.  What got me thinking about it was hearing from a Japanese friend that they honor their soldiers who fought in the war, and some people are even taught that the Kamikaze pilots were ""fighting for freedom"".  And the Japanese arguably committed as many atrocities as the Nazis.  The South in the US still venerates their soldiers who fought for the confederacy... so I was curious about the situation in Germany.  If soldiers who fought for the Nazis did things that would have been seen as heroic if they were on the other side (ie: risking their lives to save their fellow soldiers), is that something that is remembered and respected?

Minister of Antiquities, Khaled al-Anani, is the one who made the claim that this was a statue of Ramesses II. He claims it to be one of the most important discoveries ever.

> No inscriptions on the statue identify it as Ramses II, said Mahmoud Afifi, head of Ancient Egyptian antiquities at the ministry, but it's discovery near the gate of a temple dedicated to Ramses II temple (sic) makes him the most likely subject. . . The jury is still out on who it depicts.

This is not the first statue found in this site, another statue of Pharaoh Seti II, who was Ramesses II's grandson, was also found at this site in the past. This has been a dig site since 2012.

I have only heard stories of what he did during the war, but only from people he knew that served with him. He never talked about it. It's one of the things I have the most regret about. But, me being just 8 years old when he passed away it was hard for him to open up. 

I had recently found some of his old war gear and wanted to share this story with the Reddit community!

I think early Slavic cultures mention something similar to berserkers, but I have no clue.

So Berserkers seem common to Celtic/Germanic/Norse cultures. But I'm curious as to whether other cultures mention a similar, ""elite"" or ""shock"" type warrior. When you think of ""Berserkers"", you think suddenly enraged warriors, highly skilled but moved to great feats of slaughter on the battlefield through pre battle preparation (ingesting drugs likely, but stories also mention praying and rituals to ""psyche up"" the warrior) or sudden trauma, triggering a more bestial, nigh unstoppable warrior state. Germanic/Norse berserkers also seem to be attributed to the God Woden/Odin, wearing wolf pelts (making them ""ulfhednar""- ""Wolf warriors"") and if popular culture is correct, basically scream out Odin's name while fighting.

Wearing animal pelts (wolves, lions, bears etc) into battle is pretty common across pre-medieval cultures but I thought the battle frenzy was limited to European ""barbarian"" tribes, until I thought back to Homer and Virgil, and they reference heroes reaching an ""aristeia"", basically, their martial peak, where they cut down numerous named characters, usually with some gods presence, encouragement or after asking for some divine assistance. While still being in control, this sounds like a berserker state to me.

So, how common are berserkers and berserker states across cultures across history? Including in some way shape or form;

Animal pelts worn in battle, unstoppable battle prowess, sudden fits of rage and some dedication to a god."

I don’t understand why. I don’t think the population of ancient times was any larger than that of the high medieval era? Did ancient historians count the supplies and baggage train as soldiers?

It's December! The month of mulled wine, festive lights, and - for our student subscribers - **deadlines!** What *fun*! Unfortunately, judging by the submissions we've been getting over the last few days, it looks like quite a few people are on the naughty list, and have tried to get /r/History to do their schoolwork for them, and ~~Father Christmas~~/~~Santa Claus~~/Gef the Talking Mongoose is disappointed ~~I think this has gone far enough~~

Anyway.

If you have an exam, an essay, or just have a *suspiciously*-specific question about the factors behind the growth of the Cod-Packing Union of Nantucket between the years 1970-1972, **don't try and use /r/History to do your work for you**. We will not be approving posts asking for help with homework, paper writing, or exam questions. This has been the rule for years, but desperation always makes people try.

If you need help with your studies, please visit /r/HomeworkHelp. They won't do it for you, but they can point you in the right direction and give you some useful guidance. Also, you might want to consider these options:



* Speak to your teacher/lecturer/professor. Attend their office hours or send them an email. It is always worth asking for an extension, *especially* if you have extenauting circumstances.
* The recommended reading list for your course should point you in the right direction.
* Check out the book lists [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist) or over on [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books). 
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fl75h3/locking_yourself_away_for_a_few_weeks_but_still/) is a collection of digitised resources compiled earlier in the year. A lot more have become available since then, so it's always worth searching. 
* Google.

_______________________________



When we've made these reminders in the past, several people have asked for clarification or stated they don't understand why we have such a policy. In general, it comes down to two main reasons:
 
###  Homework help doesn't generate a lot of discussion. They're usually very specific questions that are really only asked as part of homework. 


If in serious numbers (and around this time of year, we're looking at dozens a day) they tend to make the subreddit less attractive for the community in general. Some people might still wonder ""but what is the harm? People can just not respond"". Which is partially correct, we have one factor that makes it a bit more difficult here: 
***Scale***. 

We have roughly 2-3 million unique visitors per month in this subreddit. The sort of homework questions we are talking about are the ""drive-by"" kind of questions. Often very simple, not very engaging or interesting for the rest of the community. If allowed though they tend to flood the subreddit which will drown out other, better, threads.


### Part of doing homework/research is applying and practicing the skills required for understanding and working with history. 

Asking people directly in /r/history defeats that very purpose. In many cases it counts as plagiarism, which is a serious academic offence. In many cases /r/HomeworkHelp is simply the better subreddit, as it focuses on the process of doing it properly. 

##### We have less of an issue if someone shows what work they have already done.


We can apply discretion for people who have already done their research, list what they have found and how they have found it and then, for example, asks if there are more places or ways they can find additional information. But simply copying out the essay question verbatim, rewording an essay prompt, or adding ""This is due tomorrow pls help"" will just get removed.

Thanks everyone! And good luck with your studies!

**P.S. We are always recruiting for the mod team, and I promise there's more to the role than homework questions! If you're interested follow [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application#mod2).**"

Ask us anything!

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period knows as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.

In [Secrets of the Dead: King Arthur’s Lost Kingdom](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/king-arthurs-lost-kingdom-full-episode/4094/), a team of experts use new archaeological discoveries to decode myths from the Dark Ages and piece together a very different story of this turning point in Britain’s history that might also explain the legend of King Arthur.

What about positive political changes arising after an epidemic?

Absolutely. I’m thinking about the end of chattel slavery in the New World. That and the success of the Haitian rebellion and Toussaint Louverture was determined, above all, by yellow fever. When Napoleon sent the great armada to restore slavery in Haiti, the slave rebellion succeeded because the slaves from Africa had immunity that white Europeans who were in Napoleon’s army didn’t have. It led to Haitian independence. Also, if one thinks from the American point of view, this was what led to Napoleon’s decision to abandon projecting French power in the New World and therefore to agree, with Thomas Jefferson, in 1803, to the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States."

While they say that in the picture he's wearing a [Gymnastyorka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastyorka) with his rank on it (3 diamonds), I think that this is just a regular coat. If that is really his actual rank, then that means that he is a Komkor (Commander of the Corps) but if that's the case, then his name is missing from [this list of Komkors from 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komkor#1939).If it helps, his name is Mark Novakovsky and my great uncle wrote a book about him which is ""somewhere on the internet, but in Russian"" according to my uncle. Could You tell me if that is his actual rank or not? Where can I find more information on him? Thanks."

Sure, Japan and Germany were “allies”, but it’s not like Hitler had a great record of honoring treaties. (NAP with the Soviet Union) 

And the American people didn't really care about the Nazis. They were just Europe being Europe to the Americans. And I know the Americans hated the Japanese. And FDR wanted to fight the Nazis, but everyone wanted to fight just the Japanese. So why did Hitler feel the need to bring the wrath of the United States into Europe?

The images are a sample from the British sector during the later Normandy fighting.  Although the German defence of Normandy was tenacious, by late August Montgomery's attritional strategy was beginning to work.  Operation Bluecoat saw the German lines south of Caumont- a previously quiet sector close to the boundary of British and American forces- torn open. Two adjacent German armies had failed to protect a vital north-south road and its bridge, and the British 11th Armoured Division was able to both take it and drive forces across, occupying hills to the south.

German forces intended to counterattack Operation Cobra were drawn into this battle, notably the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, and intense fighting raged for a week before the Germans fell on the defensive, trying to hold off the Allied forces to allow their army in Normandy to escape back to the Seine River."

Ever since then, I've been compulsively watching YouTube vids and playing historical video games, and taking college classes. 

It's the one subject I really look forward to. 

However due to bad luck my family is poor as shit, therefore I am poor as shit. I have an opportunity to study history at the U of Minnesota which holds one of the best history programs in the Midwest. 

It would be a blast earning a degree in the field, however if I choose to pursue this route, I more than likely will have to take large loans out to pay for college. 

What are the chances of getting a descent enough job to pay off my loans after I complete my B.S.?

But what I actually want to know is - has there ever really been a practice of literally stopping a battle for the two sides to have their afternoon tea?
While this does sound rather comical, I find the thought very intriguing, as it would lend so much more of a ""gentleman approach"" to early warfare. You know the picture: 17th or 18th century, two armies standing on opposite ends of a wide open field, taking shots at each other in turns at the command of their leaders - who would eventually shout ""TEA TIME!"" - resulting in both sides laying down their muskets to have some tea before continuing to try and kill each other.
 
Of course, this is one hell of a cliché, but I'd be interested in any information about whether this was actually a thing or not."

I know Sherpa people have lived in the area for hundreds of years and are famously skilled mountaineers. Is it possible somebody from one of the Sherpa clans (or an older group from the area) climbed Everest without oxygen & modern equipment before the 20th century? Or was scaling the mountain religiously/culturally forbidden and/or impossible without modern equipment? 

Human nature is such that I imagine so long as Everest has been there, somebody living underneath it has at least WANTED to climb to the summit. Cool to think it might have been at least possible.

""the approaches which the southern Irish ports and airfields could so easily have guarded were closed by the hostile aircraft and U-boats. This indeed was a deadly moment in our life, and if it had not been for the loyalty and friendship of Northern Ireland, we should have been forced to come to close quarters with Mr. de Valera, or perish from the earth. However, with a restraint and poise to which, I venture to say, history will find few parallels, His Majesty’s Government never laid a violent hand upon them, though at times it would have been quite easy and quite natural, and we left the de Valera Government to frolic with the German and later with the Japanese representatives to their heart’s content.""

Dev's response:

""Allowances can be made for Mr. Churchill’s statement, however unworthy, in the first flush of victory. No such excuse could be found for me in this quieter atmosphere. There are, however, some things it is essential to say. I shall try to say them as dispassionately as I can. Mr. Churchill makes it clear that, in certain circumstances, he would have violated our neutrality and that he would justify his actions by Britain’s necessity. It seems strange to me that Mr. Churchill does not see that this, if accepted, would mean that Britain's necessity would become a moral code and that when this necessity became sufficiently great, other people’s rights were not to count... that is precisely why we had this disastrous succession of wars — World War No.1 and World War No.2 — and shall it be World War No.3? Surely Mr. Churchill must see that if his contention be admitted in our regard, a like justification can be framed for similar acts of aggression elsewhere and no small nation adjoining a great Power could ever hope to be permitted to go its own way in peace. It is indeed fortunate that Britain's necessity did not reach the point where Mr. Churchill would have acted. All credit to him that he successfully resisted the temptation which I have no doubt many times assailed him in his difficulties, and to which, I freely admit, many leaders might have easily succumbed. It is indeed hard for the strong to be just to the weak, but acting justly always has its rewards. By resisting his temptation in this instance, Mr. Churchill, instead of adding another horrid chapter to the already bloodstained record of the relations between England and this country, has advanced the cause of international morality — an important step, one of the most important indeed that can be taken on the road to the establishment of any sure basis for peace....

Mr. Churchill is proud of Britain’s stand alone, after France had fallen and before America entered the war. Could he not find in his heart the generosity to acknowledge that there is a small nation that stood alone not for one year or two, but for several hundred years against aggression; that endured spoliations, famine, massacres, in endless succession; that was clubbed many times into insensibility, but each time on returning to consciousness took up the fight anew; a small nation that could never be got to accept defeat and has never surrendered her soul?""

Don't they have war debts to pay, cities to build and population to grow back? How could it project its power so vast across Europe when everyone else was recuperating.

America I can understand. But how did Russia do it?"

I don't know much about the topic, but I do know that he was a pilot for the Luftwaffe. He died when I was still a teenager, so I never got the time to ask him about it myself. I suspect he has seen and/or done a lot, because he served for several years, but he understandably tried to avoided the topic if possible. All I know I was told by my parents, so I have no idea how close to the truth it is.

I was told that his plane was shot down somewhere in Russia, crashed, and that he was captured by the Red Army. He survived and espaced captivity at some point, although I do not know if he was released after the war or actually escaped on his own before that. 

This is his helmet. As you can see, he was shot in the head. He was very lucky, because the bullet only scraped his skin and did not penetrate his skull. I was told that he had some kind of metal splinter/residues left beneath the skin, which were never removed because an operation was deemed too risky.

I do not know which regiment or division he served on, or whether he actually was a Nazi or not. His wife, my grandma, always claimed that they ""didn't know"" about the holocaust. I personally doubt that's the truth. But I respected their desire to avoid the topic, and so did my parents. As of today, my grandma has passed away a few months ago as well, so my parents took the helmet and my mum gave it to me (because I am a little history nerd). It's laying around on my closet gathering dust at the moment. 

That's all for now, thanks for reading! :)

Edit: Because it seems to be common question: No idea why he got to keep the helmet. It is entirely possible that his plane crash in Russia and his injury are not even related. "

However, the article makes certain points that are worth thinking about before the enthusiasm gets out of hand: Namely that market cap is a measure of stock value rather than necessarily the fundamentals of a company, although those too are continuously increasing for Tesla as it builds out its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada, solar panel factory in New York, and various other facilities.

Ford remains overwhelmingly dominant compared to Tesla in its pace of manufacturing and delivery, and yet the news is a milestone in a trend that has been unfolding for years.  Tesla has been continuously advancing its ability to produce, and despite occasional dips in stock price, the stock has kept well ahead of the shockwave.

A company that was not supposed to exist according to...well...*everyone*...now has a market capitalization of $45 billion, after a decade and a half of growth and hard-fought survival at times.  But here's where the future interest comes into light: Tesla is no longer ""merely"" a car company.

Tesla is growing both up and down its own supply chain - expanding across its own entire industrial sector - entering the energy production, energy storage, and energy management industries that will increase the value of its cars.  It is also *creating* an entire industrial science of the factory-as-product, rooted in designing whole factories as if they were single products limited only by the basic laws of physics.

A lot of OEM companies extend tendrils into their own supply chains, but these are usually just hedges - they maintain a basic capacity to serve their own needs if a major supplier has a serious interruption.  And, of course, as leverage in negotiations with their suppliers if someone is trying to strong-arm them.  That is not what Tesla is doing.

Tesla is out for conquest.  Having watched this company evolve since a decade ago, and watched its vision evolve, I can say that it intends - over the longest term - to become the world's dominant producer of clean energy infrastructure, related systems, and the building and transport technologies that utilize it.

Disaster is entirely possible when ambitions are so grand, and Tesla has averted it so often that one has to wonder if Musk's genius is not mixed in with some strain of adrenaline-driven recklessness, but sooner or later you have to admit that the best guide to what someone will achieve in the future is what they have already achieved in the past.

Tesla has the tools, the talent, and the ambition to own the world.  I think they will.  They will change the energy and transport systems of the world, and possibly the basic way in which we manufacture on a large scale.  Over decades, I think they will surpass all other automakers, and then surpass them all *combined*, beginning to then challenge companies like Apple and Google - who have themselves shown awareness of the danger by experimenting with entering the auto market.  The world's first trillion-dollar company may be among us.

But knock on wood.  Knock on it soundly."

If you're able to escape to a different purpose it still revolves around your capacity to earn money, which usually is driven by a consumer based economy, pay taxes, and die.

If you're an artist, you are typically only making money if your art can make money for someone. For video games, if there isn't a profit involved then it doesn't get made. People sacrifice quality and passion to drive profits. But what are these profits after all? Essentially they're the individual's ability to amass more wealth and that wealth is used to amass more consumer goods. 

What if, instead, a higher emphasis were placed on advancing science and technology for the betterment of all of the planet? If everyone looked away from consumer goods and could contribute to a higher purpose, then even mind numbing jobs would have more meaning than simply acquiring wealth for consumerism and survival. Instead, now you're working to improve the advancement of all of humanity, because your tax contributions (for example) are focused on giving all of humanity greater advancements in science and medicine and tech which would, in turn, make life easier and enriched for everyone. 

The excess wealth would not be amassed by individuals which is sat on and squandered, but it would expand and enrich these pursuits which have the primary purpose of automating processes and providing solutions to problems which all humans face. 

Imagine if a medical program had trillions of dollars at its disposal worth of power, instead of a few hundred humans having that wealth between themselves for no reason other than that they invested it half a century ago? 

I know this is a radical attack on our current principles and economics but I think that we need to make a drastic shift because the rates of suicide and depression are very obvious indicators that humans are not content with slavery to a perpetual system of stepping on each other for the sake of profits and increasing individual bank accounts. 

Cant we, instead of *fighting* and hoarding for a better future, work towards sincerely creating as close to a utopia as possible without individual wealth and power being a concern? What if there is simply a solution through future tech that every human can experience happiness and have all of the necessities they require for a healthy and fulfilling life? What if it doesn't involve owning mansions and drowning in excess? What if that could be experienced through future virtual reality for personal pleasure instead of actual reality at the expense of so many billions of humans lives?

I think we have come to a point where this is actually possible. Maybe not in the next ten years. But I think it is something that can be worked towards. It would involve cooperation and genuine interest in providing our societies most brilliant minds with the propensity they need to achieve the greatest groundbreaking achievements possible in the shortest amount of time. 

Currently many limitations in science, medicine, and technology are set by financial limits. Why should this be the case? I think that our planet has enough resources and enough hard working and intelligent people that we could achieve a far greater version of life than the average person currently experiences. Imagine instead of having to choose between buying a new fancy car and a new fancy house if you were already content and happy with what you have and you were able to choose how you spend your free time with your friends and family? I think time is more valuable than the pursuit of consumer goods. We could provide much needed time and peace of mind to more people if our science and tech allowed us to. 

Why do we not have bright minds focused towards these pursuits by giving them the tools they need to do so? We put so much emphasis on working long hours to amass wealth to make the next expensive clothing or the next fast car or the next big television, but these things are empty temporary pleasures that have very little happiness value compared to a harmonious society where people rely on advanced possibilities, technologies/scientific & medical breakthroughs of the future which are no longer a dream because we have all contributed to making them real here and now instead of simply wishing. 

It would be possible for everyone to have everything they could dream of in an advanced virtual reality for example. Why do we need physical goods and waste and byproducts of waste as things and stuff just grow obsolete or damaged and constantly replaced by the next shiny things and stuff? 

This is a little bit of a rambling but it's an idea I had and thought I'd share it. Maybe I'm not able to make sense of this idea any better. Perhaps some of you can throw your ideas out there as well. Even if we are just dreaming, I think dreams are important and eventually become reality when people see incentive in them. A lot of talk of socialism seems to still revolve around profits and an archaic sense of monetary wealth. I just feel that our current technology has shown that this system is becoming obsolete and we should shift towards something better. I know rich people wont like this as much as poor people because they have a hand up on everyone, but what if that hand up is unnecessary and what if your happiness could increase along with everyone else's by owning and being part of an advanced civilization instead of sitting in the 21st century still arguing over 17th century ideologies?"

___

Yesterday, the *Jerusalem Post* ran a story with the headline: [A cure for cancer. Israeli scientists say they think they found one: “we believe we will offer in a year's time a complete cure for cancer.""](https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/A-cure-for-cancer-Israeli-scientists-say-they-think-they-found-one-578939?fbclid=IwAR3aNem1hoRIP1R-DxqDf36ntHAXd7VGT0a_Ki_-6zkVJRxsDUdXn65jM7A). The NY POST, FoxNews, Forbes, multiple Murdoch TV outlets and more ran similar articles. Even on reddit, the post was heavily upvoted in subreddits ranging from r/futurology to r/worldnews to r/the_donald.

Frankly, the ability of unpublished research from a no-name company to garner this type of attention stunned me. And really made me angry. I had two relatives reach out to me asking if I had heard the good news. Injecting this kind of hype into science is good for no one. It gives patients false expectations. It gives researchers perverse incentives to sensationalize their findings. It makes the already hard business of developing effective medicines more difficult than it needs to be.

I think, intuitively, many of us rejected the article as likely to be false. Claims of curing cancer in a year seem preposterous, to anyone with a bit of familiarity for how drug development works. And many of us have internalized the idea that 'cancer isn't one disease, it is a collection of related diseases' and were appropriately skeptical that one drug could cure them all.

That said, people have been asking for a more specific breakdown of the story. I am a bit loathe to give it more attention, but since it is already trending, it might be worth helping generate a discussion about the specifics of what is wrong with this story.

At its core, the basic premise of the research here is that:

> sometimes tumors evolve resistance to drugs with single targets, so let's use our platform to develop drugs with multiple targets

On the face of it, it sounds good. Combination therapies have worked wonders in the viral and bacterial spaces. So why not cancer?

The truth is, we already do use combination therapies across all sorts of cancers. Chemo + targeted therapy (say, [R-CHOP](https://www.verywellhealth.com/r-chop-2252166)) has worked wonders for some blood cancers, for example. There are a myriad of other examples. Some are amazingly effective. Some are modestly better than the previous standard of care. Some combos involve chemo. Some don't.

But, we still haven't cured cancer. It's a tricky SOB.

Now let's try to dig a bit more into the specifics of the company's 'miracle cure' claims:

The research tools described in the article and on the company website give little to suggest that they will overcome the factors that have limited the success of other targeted approaches (toxicity, resistance, identifying good targets etc.). Essentially, it looks like they are using a fairly standard drug discovery phage display platform to find peptides that bind tumor cells. Their plan is then to link these peptides to a chemotoxin and thereby more specifically deliver toxic drugs to tumors.

A few things:

1. This basic technology already exists in the form of multiple FDA approved drugs ([Adcetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentuximab_vedotin) for certain blood cancers; [Kadcyla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trastuzumab_emtansine) for breast cancer) with more under development. These are good drugs. But in neither case would anyone call them 'cures'.

2. The article highlights that the researchers use 'Nobel prize winning' [phage display technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display) as if to connote that the research they are doing is particularly impactful. This is nonsense. The technology won the Nobel because it is so broadly used. Sometimes it yields amazing results. Sometimes it yields crap. The fact that the researchers are using phage display to generate peptides is close to meaningless.

3. The real challenge in this approach of using peptides/proteins to more specifically deliver toxins to tumor cells is finding targets that are adequately specific to the tumors of interest. The researchers gave no indication that they have made a breakthrough on this front. And I cannot imagine what a target that broadly marked all tumor types and no essential normal tissue would look like. That is a holy grail type target in the field.

A few things too about how the results are described that drove me crazy:

1. The article states they have ""concluded its first exploratory mice experiment, which inhibited human cancer cell growth and had no effect at all on healthy mice cells"". THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE! Mice are not humans. Human-target-specific peptide will recognize human epitopes on the tumor xenograft cells, but possibly not the mouse epitopes. That's why lots of drugs look awesome in mouse models - highly specific binders to implanted human cells with low mouse off-targets of course minimizes target-related toxicity.

2. The article quotes: “Our results are consistent and repeatable.” Umm.. what? YOU JUST SAID THEY FINISHED THE FIRST EXPERIMENT!

3. The articles did a terrible job getting outside opinions to reality check these extraordinary claims. To me that is shoddy journalism.

Sorry for the rant - but this one really bothered me! Happy to take any more questions about this story/drug development!"

The parrot, lacking stimulation, notices that the man frequently makes a certain set of sounds. It tries to replicate these sounds, and notices that when it does so, the man pays attention to the parrot. Desiring more stimulation, the parrot repeats these sounds until it is capable of a near-perfect mimicry of the phrase ""fucking hell,"" which it will chirp at the slightest provocation, regardless of the circumstances.

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you. 

(As an aside, has Reddit Cares ever actually helped anyone? I've only seen it used as a way of suggesting someone you disagree with - on the internet no less - should Roblox themselves, which can't be at all the intended use case)"

Huge Breakthrough. They can now use red light to see anywhere inside the body at the resolution of the smallest nueron in the brain (6 microns) yes it works through skin and bone including the skull. Faster imaging than MRI and FMRI too!

Full brain readouts and computer brain interactions possible. Non invasive. Non destructive.

Technique is
1. shine red light into body.
2.Modulate the color to orange with sound sent into body to targeted deep point.
3. Make a camera based hologram of exiting orange wavefront using matching second orange light.
4. Read and interprete the hologram from the camera electronoc chip in one millionth of a second.
5.Scan a new place until finished.



 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awADEuv5vWY


By comparision MRI is about 1 mm resolution so cant scan brain at nueron level.


Light technique can also sense blood and oxygen in blood so can provide cell activiation levels like an FMRI.


Opens up full neurons level brain scan and recording.

Full computer and brain interactions.

Medical diagnostics of course at a very cheap price in a very lightweight wearable piece of clothing.

This is information just revealed last week for the first time.

This has biotech, nanotech, ai, 3d printing, robotics control, and life extension cryogenics freezing /reconstruction implicatjons and more.

I rarely see something truly new anymore.  This is truly new.

In many jobs and colleges worldwide remote-anything is looked down upon, often out of pure preprogrammed traditions. I am definitely looking forward to things being more flexible. But I really hope we look back and remember 2020 as the year that changed how we normally work and learn. What do you think will happen?

Edit: after reading through the comments, a lot of people mention the lost social factor when working/learning remotely. I actually agree, that’s an obvious disadvantage to working remotely 100% of the time. And as many mentioned a system where you “just do the work/learning however you like” is probably best. You can come into work some days and work remotely other days. Having both options is important."

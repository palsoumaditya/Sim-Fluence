He asked her for her number and she said that when she turns 18 she will give it to him. I'm stuck on the fact that he asked a 17 year old for their number anyway. What if she wouldn't have declined? He also went to her Facebook and saved pictures of her to his phone to send to us. I also found out that a girl that he previously talked to for a few years was freshly 18 and idk bruh this all grosses me out and I don't want to be his friend anymore.

It was pretty funny to be honest, and I never gave it much thought. But I realized that I have been partaking in a joke that I never actually got.

I had a good connection with them, and they are all really good kids, so I don't really think that they were making fun of me.

Can someone (maybe an 8th grader) explain this joke to me?

And how would you respond if someone calls you a goat?

Is there anything simple I may have forgotten?

Edit: HI everyone, I'm back! I'll do a detailed update after work, but overall it was incredibly boring. I have plenty more to share but all in all, 2/10 don't recommend

Edit 2: Well I already typed this out once and accidentally deleted it, so sorry for the delay. I'll start off by saying jail is not very fun that's for sure. So after I made this post, before it blew up, I did a last check of my apartment, made sure my bills were good and I had someone to check on my place. My sister came and picked me up around noon, we got a bit high and went to watch Across the Spider-Verse (10/10, loved it). After that we hit up the Wendy's by the jail for my proverbial last supper. Honestly I was very anxious so I had to pretty much how force myself to eat it, but I'm glad I did. I turned myself in at exactly 6:00pm to the jail. Initially they didn't even know I was supposed to show up, but they got that squared away pretty quickly. First they had me sign some paperwork and get a little medical check up, just vitals and some questions. Next they had me strip down and take a shower, they gave me some anti lice shampoo that made my scalp and body incredibly cold. Next they gave me my jail clothes and had me go through a full body scan to make sure I wasn't carrying drugs in my prison wallet. They give orange jumpsuits to inmates who have been arrested, but are awaiting court, gray to inmates who have been sentenced (me), and white clothes to the workers. Workers have their clothes and towels changed out every day, while everyone else got them switched on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. They also gave us new sheets on Sundays. After I was dressed and clean enough, they sent me back to the ""intake dorm"" so to speak. This was a room with 24 cells in it, 12 on top, 12 on bottom. There was a common area with 6 tables and a TV, as well as a pull up bar that you could also do dips on. This specific jail doesn't have outside recreation time anymore because the state says a pull up bar is enough to count as recreation time. So basically I was inside a room with nearly no windows for my sentence. My cell here was about 12 feet long and 7 feet wide. It had a sink, toilet, and a desk in it. The ""bed"" was a metal rack with about an inch of foam to lay on. We didnt get pillows, but we got 2 sheets and a wool blanket that was very itchy. I used the wool blanket as my pillow and covered up with a sheet, while using the other sheet to act as a barrier between me and the foam. Luckily for me I am a very warm sleeper, because the jail was kept very cold at all times. Since the intake dorm is a medium security block, we had to lockdown in our cells from 1pm-3pm, as well as 9pm-6am everyday. At 6am sharp, they turn all of the lights on and announce ""head count"" on the speaker. This means I had to get out of my bed and go stand by the cell door while the guards came around and made sure no one escaped over night. If you didn't get out of bed they locked you in your cell for 24 hours until the next morning. After that I would lay back down and try to sleep until breakfast came at 7am. Breakfast was generally cereal with milk, peanut butter with toast, and either apple or orange juice. The food menu was the same every week, I'll post that somewhere down below. After breakfast I always went back to my cell to lay down and try to get some sleep, but the intake dorm was incredibly loud. People couldn't seem to have a conversation without yelling, people were playing dominoes and cards from 6am to 9pm slapping them on the table, no one had any respect for other people basically because it's a bunch of literal criminals who just got to jail. Not to mention how bright the lights were. What I'm saying is there wasn't many nap opportunities in that block. Since I couldn't sleep much I read my books (library was every Wednesday morning, luckily my first morning there. Could check out 4 books), brushed up on my spades and rumi skills, learned how to play tonk, played a bit of poker too. I played some chess, and lost a game to an old man. I was thinking all day about how bad I wanted to play him again, only for him to get released right after dinner. I still want that rematch Randy. Sometime before lunch I would shower. In this dorm there were 2 separate single person showers. They were very small, and way too hot. Don't even THINK about stepping foot in there without your sandals on. Also don't touch the walls. Or the curtain. Basically don't touch anything but the button that makes water come out, the showers were nastier than any shower I've had to use in my many many years playing hockey. This includes the multiple showers with literal shit on the floor.  I managed to not drop the soap too, a skill I've been honing all my life. Now, I went in on a Tuesday night and immediately put in a commissary order of shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, some Ramen, some candy, you get it, the essentials. I got all of that on Thursday morning which was nice, until I realized I forgot to buy deodorant, yay :) I'm very about my personal hygiene, and commissary didn't come again until the next Tuesday, so that was a rough week for me. Honestly it didn't make much of a difference, since half of the people in there didn't shower or brush their teeth at all, making the dorm smell.. unique to put it lightly. The toothbrush they give to the inmates is a grand total of 2 inches long, which meant I had to basically deepthroat my fingers two or three times a day to clean my teeth. Not a good look in jail. The reason is so no shanks could be made, but they gave us a very long very hard plastic spoon that could stab someone perfectly well, so I call bullshit. Anyway, after all that, lunch came around 12pm. We would eat and lounge about some more until 1pm when they locked us in our cells. From 1pm-3pm it was generally pretty quiet since everyone was in their own space, so naturally I slept as much as I could, because why would I want to be conscious in jail when I don't have to be? When 3pm came around they did head count again, and again if you weren't fully dressed by your cell door they would lock you in your cell for 24 hours. I never had that happen but I sure witnessed it happening plenty. Usually it was because someone was withdrawaling from drugs or they were understandably depressed about being incarcerated. After that we would do the same shit, just waiting around until more food came. Dinner was sometime between 5:30 and 6pm. I guess ill post the food menu here since you're all dying to know. I'll preface that by saying the county jail that I went to has a reputation, unbeknownst to me, for actually having good food compared to other jails in my state. I would compare it to the school lunches I got in high school, not amazing but it was edible, and for that I feel lucky. So here's the menu

Monday: Breakfast- sausage and cheese McMuffin (delicious), hash brown, juice, milk.
Lunch- Mac and cheese (not bad), either cucumber salad or zucchini, milk. 
Dinner- sloppy Joe with a biscuit (eh), peas and carrots, bread and butter

Tuesday: Breakfast- froot loops, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.
Lunch- cheese pizza (cardboard) breadstick, salad, milk
Dinner- meatball sub (pretty good), a random vegetable

Wednesday: Breakfast- cheerios, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.
Lunch- cheeseburger (good), fries (bad), cucumber salad, milk.
Dinner- vegetable soup (tasted good but it was literally 6 spoonfuls of soup), celery and carrots, bread and butter

Thursday: Breakfast- egg and cheese bagel
Lunch- grilled cheese (6 fuckin pieces of unmelted cheese), tomato soup, crackers, milk. 
Dinner- turkey (rubbery, but decent) with stuffing, gravy, peas, bread and butter

Friday: Breakfast- corn flakes, peanut butter and toast, juice, milk.
Lunch- chicken tacos (delicious), zucchini, milk
Dinner- polish sausage, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, bread and butter

Saturday: Breakfast- ""pancakes"" with syrup, hard boiled egg, juice, milk. They were not good pancakes
Lunch- hot dog, baked beans, tater tots, milk
Dinner- don't remember

Sunday: Breakfast- rice bran, peanut butter with toast, juice, milk. 
Lunch- don't remember
Dinner- rice and chicken with some sort of brown sauce. Not BBQ, wasn't bad, A vegetable, bread and butter.

All of the meat was turkey or chicken.

After dinner we did a whole lot of nothing until 9pm when they locked us down. My block actually had 1 inmate who was waiting to be sentenced on an arson charge with attempted murder tacked on there, so he wasn't allowed around other inmates and was on 23 hour lock down. His 1 hour of free time was from 9pm-10pm when we were locked in our cells and oh my, this guy was a fuckin nut. He drank the cleaning products, are trash off the floor, walked around naked one night, harassed everyone else, and was just generally very entertaining to all of the other very bored inmates. We called him Charlie because he was basically Charles Manson Jr. I do not miss that guy. Anyway at 10pm they turned the lights off, but it never actually gets dark in jail. This posed a problem for me, because I have serious trouble falling asleep as it is. So I would read until I got sleepy enough, then use my shirt to cover my eyes and doze off. Usually I was pretty hungry at bed time so I would eat a Ramen before I brushed my teeth. There wasn't a microwave in the intake dorm so I would fill my bowl of noodles with warm water, until the noodles got soft. Then I would dump that water out and put new warm water in and mix in the seasoning. The cells sink water only got to about 100-110 degrees so it wasn't very good, but it was food so I'm not complaining. The food they served us was good enough, but there was never very much of it so I had to make due with what I had. For reference I'm 5""11' and about 165lbs. I've always been active and have a physically engaging job, so I eat a bit more and burn more calories. I would end up falling asleep some time around 1 or 2am most days until 6am when it started all over again. After a week in there they finally moved me back to the minimum security dorm. This was a room about the size of a gymnasium with much lower ceilings. There were a total of 78 beds, 19 bunk beds on the back wall, with 2 rows of 20 single beds just in front of them. There was a communal bathroom with 3 urinals, 3 toilets (and cleaner to use before every movement), and 6 shower heads. Despite the 6 showers we could only use 1 at a time, apparently with the exception of the one guy who just hopped in there with me for a few minutes, cleaned, and went about his day. Like I said I've played hockey for many years and showered with a lot of other guys, so I just treated it the same way and neither of us acknowledged the other. There was a guard desk with a guard in there 24/7. 95% of the time the guards were scrolling tiktok or playing online poker, paying no attention to the inmates, and even less attention to the showers that were 25 feet away from them. The other 5% they would walk from bunk to bunk looking for stashes of fruit or unmade beds. We had a couple shakedowns (where they tear the whole place up looking for contraband), nothing really came of them though. The intake dorm also had a vending machine stocked with Ramen, candy, other sweets like honeybuns and cinnamon rolls and things of that nature, pop (soda for you nonmidwesterners), coffee, sugar, you get the idea. A ""Commissary to go"" machine if you will. Everything from the vending machine was also less expensive ($1 for Ramen instead of $1.40, $2.55 for pop instead of $2.85, etc). There was also 2 microwaves and 2 TVs, 1 TV always on ESPN or some other sports channel, the other on a movie or show. The minimum dorm also didn't lock down from 1pm-3pm, and didn't lock down at night until 10pm. So while you sacrificed privacy, the microwave and vending machine were too good to pass up, so everyone stayed in there. Oh also the cot you slept on was actually somewhat comfortable,  as much as foam on a metal rack can be I guess. All of the workers stayed here as well as most non violent offenders who weren't a nuisance. There were a couple fights in here though, and the people involved got immediately sent to the hole (yes, it's a real thing). Basically a cell with no TV, no other people, no commissary, basically nothing at all but your thoughts and the occasional tray of food to tell what time it is. I luckily did not have to check it out for myself. The days went by the same way in minimum, except I didn't get a nap time from 1-3pm, so I got even less sleep in there. I did however get to read more books, so it wasn't all bad. The only things to do were sleep, eat, read, play cards, maybe a little chess if you're feelin froggy that day, or sit on a metal seat and watch TV. The seats were unbearable for more than an hour. A lot of people also walked laps or did pull ups on the bullshit machine that was supposed to be our recreation area. Did I mention we weren't allowed outside? Yeah I'm still a bit salty about that so I'll say it again. There were phones in each dorm to use. After your 1 free call, using the phone cost 21 cents per minute, which is damn expensive so I used it sparingly. There was a guy who was arrested on some crazy drug trafficking charges in there (2kgs of cocaine, $25,000 in cash) awaiting his trial. He used the phone for 8 HOURS A DAY.  I am not exaggerating. He also didn't speak a lick of English and would sometimes start screaming into the phone. He actually got sent back to the secure dorms because he missed headcount.. because he was on the phone. I feel like there's a lot I'm missing, and it'll all come to me later, but for now I'll wrap it up. Jail is not a fun place to be, never has been, never will be. That said I deserved it, and I did the time. Lastly stay positive, life is too short to spend it any other way."

TL;DR: I live in Kyiv. People are split, but no one really wants to aknowledge the fact that we might be on the brink of war with (the better word would probably be 'destruction by') russia. Like, what's the point in talking about it? So we don't. Government just issued a leaflet about what to have in your medkit and how to behace in case of artillery strikes, so there's that. News are bleak, you don't know what to believe, maybe it's propaganda, maybe it's the boy who cried 'wolf', maybe it's a distraction. Fireworks went out yesterday (which are by the way illegal due to veterans with PTSD from war) and I was scared it was a strike. I'm prone to anxiety so maybe I'm not the most objective spectator, but it's fucking hard. You either read the news and realize it gets worse and worse, or you stick your head into the sand and wish it would all go away. Something like this happened before, but never on this scale, they're spending a lot of effort and money bringing all these troops (over 100k) and vehicles (they even had 90 trains with tanks in Belarus out of a sudden) and ships around us. And since the west didn't blink, either putin's bluffing or doesn't care. Fuck.

Edit 3: please stop telling me to turn to religion. Simple as that

Edit 4: With an extremely heavy heart I’m sorry to say that OP lost his battle with cancer today. OP was blown away by all the support and advice he received from this thread. He definitely appreciated all the advice."

While I couldn't read all the replies, I gathered that the main arguments against euthanasia are money and the fear that people would take advantage of it, as well as religion.
For those wondering, I'm from Italy and well here the problem is definitely religion. But we did have a very talked about case a while ago where a paraplegic guy was helped to die by his friend. The friend went to trial for this but in the end, he was found not guilty.

Anyway, thank you to everyone who replied, best wishes to all :)"

Anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

He was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn’t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

I wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? 

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn’t even know what happened, but reading online I don’t know if that’s true. 

I’m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn’t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don’t know if I can.

I didn’t think I’d get this many responses, I honestly just randomly wrote this question trying to help myself with the new grief and pain I was feeling in the moment. 

Truly, thank you everyone for taking the time to answer and respond.

When I was accidentally about to microwave a metal plate, I was questioned why the hell I would do that, and I said its because I didn't know because no one told me. They were surprised, because they thought this was supposed to be common knowledge.

Well, it can't be common knowledge if you aren't taught it in the first place. Looking back now, as someone who is about to live by himself, I was wondering what are some other ""common knowledge"" tips that everyone should know so that they can prevent life-threatening accidents.

Edit: Maybe I was a little too specific with the phrase ""common knowledge"". Like, I know not to put a candle next to curtains, because they would obviously catch on fire. But things like not mixing bleach with ammonia (which are in many cleaning products, apparently), a person would not know unless they were told or if they have some knowledge in chemistry."

I feel like I’m going crazy, but I’m pretty sure that my girlfriend has been hiding the fact that she’s illiterate. We’ve been dating for about six months, and here are the things I’ve noticed in that time:

* She never texts me, she only ever wants to talk on the phone. Any time I’ve ever texted her, she’s either called me in response or else just doesn’t respond to it at all. She claims that this is because she just hates texting.
* She works as a barista; she told me a story about how they changed the Point of Sale system they use and she was screwing up orders for a week because she used to just “have it memorized where everything was in the system”.
* Whenever we go to a restaurant, she always says she’s not sure what she wants and asks me what I think she should try. 90% of the time she also asks me to order for her. I’m not sure if she actually really looks at the menu.
* She rarely captions photos on her IG, usually just emojis. Also this is the only social media that she has.
* She was in the foster care system and moved around a lot as a child, which could explain disrupted schooling.
* She isn’t in college and has no interest in going, she said because she always struggled in school and sees no reason to subject herself to it as an adult.
* I’ve never seen her read a book or even a magazine, and when I see her on her phone she’s usually on IG or playing Match 3 games but never reading an article that I can remember.
* I once let her borrow my copy of the book that her favorite movie is based on, because she mentioned that she’d never read it. She gave it back to me a few weeks later claiming that she never found time to read it and felt bad that she was holding it hostage.

Am I crazy, or does it sound like I’m onto something here? And should I ask her about it? I can’t imagine anything more insulting than asking someone if they’re illiterate, especially because I sometimes get the feeling that she feels like I’m “smarter than her” because I’m in college and she isn’t. (I don’t think I’ve done anything to make her feel that way, but she’s mentioned it in passing.)"

qlb30j,Do Americans really buy milk by the gallon?,28302,0.84,5035,2021-11-03 00:13:36,NoStupidQuestions,4944439,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/qlb30j/do_americans_really_buy_milk_by_the_gallon/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/qlb30j/do_americans_really_buy_milk_by_the_gallon/,self.NoStupidQuestions,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I mean, that’s like 8 pints of milk in one go? 4.5 litres of milk? How does it even fit in the fridge? How can you use it all before it goes off? What on Earth are you guys doing with all that milk?

EDIT: OK, so a US Gallon (3.7 litres) is only slightly bigger than a UK 6 pint bottle (3.4 litres), and not a 4.5 litre monstrosity. American milk also takes 2 weeks to go off, everyone has 5 children, a fridge the size of a Volkswagen, and drinks a pint of milk with every meal.

EDIT2: Lots of people just read the title, and not the text (on reddit, who knew?). So this edit probably won't stem that tide, but I'm going to clarify the question, and what I have learned from the many answers. 

My question was 'why do Americans buy milk in such a ridiculously impractical single unit as a gallon?' It's like someone saying 'oh, just grab me one of those 10 kilo salmon from the store on the way home?' and everyone just nodding like it's not completely insane for a grocery store to stock a single 10 kilo salmon, and for a person to then lug it home and consume the whole thing before it goes off. 

What prompted this question was watching The Taking of Pelham 123, where they make a really big deal of him coming home with a gallon of milk, and it made me think 'why on Earth would you buy milk by the gallon? Because here in the UK, which some people don't know is also populated by milk-drinking humans, the largest milk size is 6 pints, not 8 pints.' The reasons why this does in fact happen are twofold, and by asking a nostupidquestion, I have now been enlightened with them: 

1. The US pint is much smaller than the UK pint, so a US 8-pint gallon is actually 3.7 litres, not the 4.5 litres of a UK gallon. So the bottle itself is only a half pint (0.3l) larger than the largest size in the UK, not the whole extra litre of milk that I imagined. It seems the largest size commonly available is 4 litres in Canada, which is sold in a bag. Europeans point out that even the 3.4l / 6 pint bottle in the UK is an absurd size. They are also right, because there is nothing worse than wanting a splash of milk for a cup of tea, and realising you have to upend a full 3.4l ewer to pour out 0.005l of milk. I've never worked in an industrial foundry, but attempting this feat gives a man insight to the challenges of that profession. 

None of this by itself explains why an individual would commonly buy milk by the gallon, until I learned:

2. American milk is more thoroughly/aggressively pasteurised than UK milk, and has a usable life of several weeks. In the UK, milk from the store will have a shelf life of about a 7-10 days, and once the bottle is opened, it'll last about 4-5 days. So all of you who are commenting 'I live by myself and get through a gallon every week' are simply reiterating my point about why buying milk by the gallon seems so absurd. If you bought a 6 pint bottle of milk in the UK and opened it on Monday, by Sunday it's going to be absolutely minging (or 'gross') and completely undrinkable. That's why individuals buy smaller quantities of milk, but more regularly, even if they also consume a gallon of milk over a week. 

Finally, on behalf of the American dairy industry, may I thank all those commenters that single-handedly bear whole families of dairy farmers upon their calcium-rich shoulders. America salutes you. I myself can only wonder, do you piss, or just break off the stalactite that forms at the end of your knob? 

Either way, I came with a stupid question, and leave with that question answered. I also fucked up by enabling emails when people reply to posts, so I can also share that when people say 'RIP inbox' its just all the post replies arriving as email notifications, and not the poster receiving loads of messages that you can't see. Good day to you all.

EDIT3: To be clear to those who didn't get this through implication, I'm well aware you can buy milk in smaller quantities than a gallon. If somebody asked 'why do you have $1,000 bills,' they're not asking because they think you pay for everything with $1,000 bills, they're wondering why such an evidently impractical thing would exist in the first place."

Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that’s all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn’t be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I’m in the clear. I believe there’s zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. "

y16aua,Someone please help me understand my trans child.,27321,0.75,4421,2022-10-11 16:41:05,NoStupidQuestions,4944439,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/y16aua/someone_please_help_me_understand_my_trans_child/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/y16aua/someone_please_help_me_understand_my_trans_child/,self.NoStupidQuestions,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This is not potstirring or political or time for a rant. Please. My child is a real person, and I'm a real mom, and I need perspective. 

I have been a tomboy/low maintenance woman most of my life. My first child was born a girl. From the beginning, she was super into fashion and makeup. When she was three, her babysitter took her to get nails and hair extensions, and she loved it. She grew into watching makeup and fashion boys, and has always been ahead of the curve. 

Not going to lie, it's been hard for me. I've struggled to see that level of interest in outward appearance as anything but shallow. But I've tried to support her with certain boundaries, which she's always pushed. For example, she had a meltdown at 12yo because I wouldn't buy her an $80 6-color eyeshadow palette. But I've held my nose and tried. 

You might notice up until now, I've referred to her as ""she/her."" That's speaking to how it was then, not misgendering. About two years ago, they went through a series of ""coming outs."" First lesbian, then bi, then pan, then male, then non-binary, then female, now male again. I'm sure I missed a few, but it's been a roller coaster. They tasted the whole rainbow. Through all of this, they have also been dealing with serious issues like eating disorders, self harm, abuse recovery, compulsive lying, etc.

Each time they came out, it was this big deal. They were shaky and afraid, because I'm religious and they expected a big blowup. But while I'm religious, I apply my religion to myself not to others. I've taught them what I believe, but made space for them to disagree. I think they were disappointed it wasn't more dramatic, which is why the coming outs kept coming. 

Now, they are comfortable with any pronouns. Most days they go by she/her, while identifying as a boy. (But never a man.) Sometimes, she/her offends them. I've defaulted to they as the least likely to cause drama, but I don't think they like my overall neutrality with the whole process. 

But here is the crux of my question. As someone who has never subscribed to gender norms, what does it when mean to identify as a gender? I've never felt ""male"" or ""female."" I've asked them to explain why they feel like a boy, how that feels different than feeling like a girl or a woman,  and they can't explain it. I don't want to distress them by continuing to ask, so I came here. 

Honestly, the whole gender identity thing completely baffles me. I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences. I've done a ton of online research and never found anything that makes a lick of sense to me. 

Any insight?

Edit: wow. I wasn't expecting such an outpouring of support. Thank you to everyone who opened up your heart and was vulnerable to a stranger on the internet. I hope you know you deserve to be cared about. 

Thank you to everyone who sent me resources and advice. It's going to take me weeks to get through everything and think about everything, and I hope I'm a better person in the other side. 

I'm so humbled by so many of the responses. LGBTQ+ and religious perspectives alike were almost all unified on one thing: people deserve love, patience, respect, and space to not understand everything the right way right now. My heart has been touched in ways that had nothing to do with this post, and were sorely needed. Thank you all. I wish I could respond to everyone. Every single one of you deserve to be seen. I will read through everything, even if it takes me days. Thank you. A million times thank you.

For the rest of you... ... ... and that's all I'm going to say. 

Finally, a lot of you have made some serious assumptions, some to concern and some to judgmentalism. My child is in therapy, and has been since they were 8 years old. Their father is abusive, and I have fought a long, hard battle to help them through and out of that. They are now estranged from him for about four years. The worst 4 years of my life. There's been a lot of suffering and work. Reddit wasn't exactly my first order of business, but this topic is one so polarizing where I live I couldn't hope to get the kind of perspective I needed offline. So you can relax. They are getting professional help as much as I know how to do. I'm involved in their media consumption and always have been on my end, though I had no way to limit it at their dad's, and much of the damage is done. Hopefully that helps you sleep well."

It's like 5'3 and looks very realistic.

I bought it when I was drunk like 2 years ago and didn't cancel the order the next day as I forgot I even ordered it; it showed up on my doorstep like 10 days later in a huge box... I tried to use it once but it is impossible to use because its so cold lol. I have it buried under clothes that I don't wear anymore in my walk-in closet for almost 2 years and every time I have a girl over I have to keep the closet locked and I even have to tell my cleaner to clean all rooms aside from my walk-in closet as I am embarrassed by it.

I NEVER litter but I don't know what to do with it. I really want to put it in the back of my truck and dump it in the woods somewhere but I know that is a shit thing to do and will not do it.

How can I dispose of it in a environmentally safe way without driving to a dump and looking like I am disposing of a dead body or having the workers laugh at me? I can't cut it up into pieces and put it into trash bags as the skeleton is metal and I just don't have the tools to do it; its a really legit sex doll it is super high quality.

My apartment complex has a huge dumpster but its all on camera; should I just go there super late at night and throw it in there? The dumpster is on camera and its for ""trash only"" it says no metal and no boxes.

Anyone have an answer on how to dispose of this thing by myself, quietly and without anyone seeing me?

Thanks !!

To note, I never joined a group or anything. Never got the tattoos either. I do want to say, that, well, I was probably on the edge of it, though, unfortunately. I was a real mean, hateful, virulent son of a bitch. Gun without a cause, you know? Keg without a fuse, or.. Like. Keg with a fuse?

Edit2: for all y’all commenting about the dollar menu — where the hell do you live that still HAS a dollar menu?!!!"

When I was a young boy, the first time I met a pregnant women was at the business place of my father. We had a little party that day, and I remember when she entered the room there was a very strong (and unpleasant) smell. Me being a kid and meeting a pregnant woman for the first time, I assumed either that's just the way they smelt, or it was a coincidence. 
    
As I grew up I met very few pregnant woman face to face, I had a very isolated childhood, but I did notice that smell only appeared when I was in a crowded place, and frequently I would be able to spot a pregnant woman somewhere in the crowd, or a woman with a baby. 

I always assumed that the reason nobody mentioned it was because it would be rude, but as I've gotten older I realize that I have never in my life heard anyone mention it. Not even an acknowledgment of the smell. This is strange to me considering it is a VERY strong smell. Virtually any room with a pregnant woman in it has smelt like that throughout, and considering its kind of a gross smell, I can't imagine EVERYONE staying silent about it.

I brought it up to some friends recently, and they had no idea what I was talking about. This prompted me to Google it, I found nothing regarding this, many articles spoke of increased B.O but this smell is completely unique, not like B.O. 

I justified it as a coincidence until just a few days ago, I was in a Starbucks staring out the window, waiting for my drink. When I smelt the smell, I turned around and in the doorway was a pregnant woman. This confirmed it for me, I now have no uncertainty that all pregnant women smell like this. But NOBODY I've spoken to can relate.

I come to you Reddit, please tell me that my super power isn't to smell when someone is pregnant. Everybody's just being polite right?"

rzewl2,My 69 yr old neighbors alarm clock has been going off since 8am.,25871,0.86,1403,2022-01-09 06:11:45,NoStupidQuestions,4944439,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/rzewl2/my_69_yr_old_neighbors_alarm_clock_has_been_going/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/rzewl2/my_69_yr_old_neighbors_alarm_clock_has_been_going/,self.NoStupidQuestions,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"-She has a hard time balancing without her walker.

-Last night I had to help bring her laundry to her apartment because she couldn't do it herself.

-I knocked on her door multiple times and called out her name. I couldn't hear anything except the alarm clock.

-I called 911 to ask for a welfare check. They said they would send someone over. Its been an hour so far and I havent heard anything back.

What else can I do? I'm concerned and anxious and dont know what else to do. She told me she's alone and she was so out of breath just trying to go up the curb to the sidewalk last night, I'm scared she may have fallen.


UPDATE: I heard a lot of sirens go by but since I live right next to a fire dept and a hospital, I wasn't sure If it was for my neighbor or unrelated issue. I went by to check on her. The alarm clock stopped. But she still didnt answer. I will try to find out what happened.


UPDATE 2: Everyone is wanting an update and so am I. I am getting different answers on who I am supposed to call for an update. Do I call dispatch again? A non-emergency number? My local PD?

I'm going to try and answer the most common questions:

-I have crazy social anxiety and I'm scared If I try to just walk in her place or break a window inside, its gonna make things a lot worse or awkward. I'm worried if I show too much concern like knocking on her door again or calling someone, people will think I'm crazy.

-I plan on walking by again to check on her.

UPDATE 3: I went by to check again. No answer. The alarm clock was off so I want to safely assume that she either turned it off that night when someone did a welfare check or someone else did and helped her. I called two local PD's in my area but since it's Sunday I've been getting redirected to answering machines. Im going to try again Monday morning because at this point I dont think knocking on her door every few hours is going to do anything. Another redditor commented that since she has a hard time walking she might not want to use the energy to come to the door for just a check up.

LAST UPDATE: SHE'S OK!!! My local PD finally called me back around 3 today. I asked for a follow-up regarding the welfare check on Saturday night. They said someone came by and she answered and shes okay. He adult son was there too. The reason for the alarm clock going off all day was because due to her limited immobility she couldn't reach to turn it off. 

It raises more questions if I'm being honest. Like, why didnt her son turn off the alarm until someone came by? And why did no one answer when I knocked multiple times and called out to her?"

As in he listens to his podcasts and actually agrees with most of the things he says. He did say that he doesn’t agree on how he views women; however, everything else he is fine with. Honestly, we’ve talked about this topic so much that I can safely say that this grown man is a fan of Andrew Tate. I, on the other hand, completely disagree with Andrew Tate. To be fair, I have only seen what Tik Tok has shown me on him, but I think I get the gist of his ideals. I think that this is a major red flag, but I want to see what y’all think.

EDIT: Just want to clarify to those saying that I should “decide for myself”… I don’t have the need to dive in more into what he says because the few things that I’ve heard, even if they’re on Tik Tok or YouTube or reels, wherever, I don’t agree and are the complete opposite to what I believe in. Like I said, I think it’s a red flag and was just curious what other people had to say.

EDIT2: A lot of people are mad about “I have only seen what TikTok has shown…” Why should I watch long videos or listen to podcasts starring someone who is constantly degrading me and encouraging his audience to do the same? Also, doing this would only give him even more money and an even bigger platform. Many comments already include either Reddit posts, articles or videos explaining more about what this man has said and done. So if anyone needs more information about the man that some are so arduously defending, scroll down."

I had some girls interested in me during college (in Vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's Vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. Then I moved to the US. Haven't found anyone since. There's so few asian in my city let alone Vietnamese. My college is full of white and latins (demographics). Don't get me wrong I don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. I made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. Some even deleted my number and ignored me. And it seems like all women are taken. In the end maybe it's because I'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). I also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


Then people made fun of me when they knew I'm a virgin. Even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

I made a post in a tech subreddit. Not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

I know it might not be a big deal. But I felt so down after that. I felt like I should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

Do I have hobbies? Yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. I keep a big fish tank and I love them. I play video games too. I've been rescuing stray dogs since I moved here. I used to volunteer at my local shelter but since I adopted my dog here and got busy with school I volunteer much less nowadays...

We were walking home from dinner and unbeknownst to me she put a few white tic tacs in her mouth - she pretended to sneeze and spit a couple teeth out. It shocked me for half a second and took my brain a bit longer to figure out what happened and by that point she was laughing hysterically. She loved the prank so much.

I of course pointed out that she just started a new phase in our relationship - a pranks phase. Her face immediately dropped as she realized our unspoken truce of not pranking each other has been broken. 

Enough time has passed and I want to “get her back.” I want something as benign and quick as hers, and I can’t think of friggin anything. Any master pranksters here that can help me?

EDIT 1: obviously this got much more attention than I expected lol. Thank you to everyone for your ideas, at their best they were great ideas I considered and at their worst they were hilarious, outlandish, and fun to read. Want to clarify one thing: the “pranks phase” was said tongue in cheek to her to get a rise out of her, there will be no actual pranks phase - I’m going to do this one and that will be it. She generally doesn’t enjoy pranks which is why the one she did was so fun to me and I’m excited to give her that same bit of joy I had! Tonight is the night! I’ve decided to go with the dry pasta/back crack. I think it’s the closest to what she did to me and the easiest to pull off. She had two long days at work so I didn’t want to add to it which is why there was a delay. I’ll update again with how it went in about 12 hours!"

Whenever I get dishes dirty I put them in the sink and run a little water over it so it doesn't dry out. When I'm ready to do the dishes, I will scrub each dish with a soapy sponge, put it on the bench top next to the sink (or a second sink if there is one), and when they're all soapy I quickly rinse them all and put them on the rack. I've lived in Australia my whole life but a lot of my close friends/family are Asian/Middle Eastern and they all do the same. This feels like the best way to save water and get the dishes nice and clean. 

But in movies I always see a sink full of gross grey soapy water and people just pull scrubbed dishes out of it and put them on the rack !!!! Thought this was a weird movie thing but was cleaning up with my partner (white Australian), and he picked up my soapy unrinsed bowl to dry it!! I was grossed out that he'd just do that but he told me it's normal???? Do you put your soapy dishes on the rack ? What if they have food grease on them ???? Is this normal ????????

Edit: this has been the ride of my life. thank you everyone for sharing your favourite dish washing method and where you're from!!! It has been thoroughly fascinating, glad to hear I'm not the only one a bit picky with my cleanliness. Seems like the UK and Europe like the sink method the best, maybe because there's less mixer taps, and definitely common in places with water scarcity. Americans seem to have a lot of dishwashers, I'm not sure how universal that is though- we don't. To everyone who rinses after they fill up the sink. I see you and I love you. You're valid.  To everyone else? Rinse your dishes please! Don't eat soap!"

Edit 2: Since it may make a difference in the type of advice the commenters choose to give on this subject, and since I’ve been asked multiple times, here is a truncated list of the things that I’d be sharing with her if I opted to go “Real Deal”. 

Anal/ATM, foot fetish, choking/breath play, spitting on/in, being spat on, slapping, gagging, ball gag, plugs, DP, Gape, Pee in gape, braces, gingers, and occasionally DD/LG just to name a few.

EDIT: The experience of telling her what I wanted was one of the greatest experiences of my life. She smiled more and more when I let her know what I liked. We ended up doing things I thought would only occur in my wildest dreams. And she was way more into it than I could have ever imagined. I took all the advice good and bad and made it into the perfect approach. But I think my life is affirmed. She might not even be able to get pregnant! So she might be my perfect partner at least for the time being in this point in my life. We did things I don’t even want to pretend I can explain but it opened up parts of my mind that I thought were going to give me a heart attack. And then she cried at the end in a really good way. I asked her why she cried and she said it was happiness. 🤷🏻‍♂️"

I took in a pregnant cat. 

An amniotic sac (unaware if there's a kitten inside) has been hanging out of her vagina for about an hour. 

She has not been pushing and due to the COVID issue there are no emergency vets open or taking calls in my area. 

It's a small bubble, half the size of a ping pong ball. 

She also won't allow me to walk away or stop petting her at all.

As far as I'm aware this is her first litter.




**UPDATE**: Luna (momma) is doing just fine and has had 6 kittens so far. From some gentle pats and belly rubs I'm guessing there's one more in there and she's just taking a rest. 

Thank you all so much for your incredible advice and support. ❤

We did end up naming the kitten Prin, short for Prince/Princess.

My wife and I just don't know what to do with our son. He is 23 years old, he just sit on his computer and chat online and play video games all day. He's not in college or anything. Said he tried applying and got accepted, but applying for financial aid was too confusing so he gave up. We kept asking him to keep trying but he won't budge. Within the past 2-3 years, he worked about 2-3 jobs, all of which he wasn't able to keep for more than a year and spent all his money on expensive computer parts and games. Each time we asked why he quit, he said he didn't like the job. I spoke to him multiple times, but one time he opened up a bit and said he finds life to be depressing. He finds the cycle of waking up, going to work, go home, sleep, and repeat depressing and doesn't want to do that for the rest of his life. He said he wanted to have a passion in something, but he can't find what he likes. He barely exit his room. Only to shower, restroom, and food. Otherwise, he stays in his room.

At this point, me and my wife wants to help him. But we don't know what to do. We've thinking of kicking him out, but I'm not sure I want to do that.

So I want to try and ask online for some opinions of other parents who are potentially in similar situations. How can we help our son?

Asked him things like if he was willing to try therapy. He said he is willing to try anything. We chatted for a few hours, and he opened up a lot more. He told me he feels stuck, like his life is now at a stagnant and only resort to working 9-5 jobs. He also confessed that he felt guilty living like this under us and does want to change, just doesn't know where to begin since there is so many resources and he feels very lost. I asked him if his mom and I were to die today, what would he do? He said he'd be very screwed since he doesn't know anything. He also said he's already been applying for jobs here and there but no one would respond. I showed him Indeed and asked him to apply there. He said it's just a bunch of outdated or fake listing and he doesn't trust it. In the end, we decided to end the conversation with an agreement that he will go to therapy, and he has 4 months to get a job. Then I will charge him rent money. He agreed to that idea.  

That is one step towards the right direction. I really pray that we can help him. All we wanted was to raise and see our son grow up and be independent. I see that perhaps we were too lenient towards him. But nonetheless, we will do whatever we can to help him. 

Thanks for the support reddit.

He ate our meal, we hung out for a bit, and now it's a couple days later and nothing bad happened. The friend finally replied to us saying he was deathly allergic to garlic, among other things. He said one bite and he breaks out. We decided not to tell him what he ate days ago had a lot of garlic in it.

I've heard that redditors are pretty good at solving these kinds of things but I don't know where to post this. Any ideas?

EDIT1: Spelling.

EDIT2: Pictures of the note: [https://imgur.com/a/ocJDxhK](https://imgur.com/a/ocJDxhK)

EDIT3: Seems like it is ASCII code, thanks to u/Vicvic38 and u/Nrutasnz. It translates to something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9rtwkx/i_found_a_weird_note_on_my_windshield/e8jp709) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9rtwkx/i_found_a_weird_note_on_my_windshield/e8jpiik).

EDIT4: Most logical answer is that it's some kind of a Halloween or birthday prank.

EDIT5: u/KitsuneRisu says the ASCII can be tranlated to HEX? Or something like that? See the comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9rtwkx/i_found_a_weird_note_on_my_windshield/e8jq8n5).

**EDIT6: Trying to summarize it: the note is an** **ASCII sequence** **which can be translated to a** **HEX code** **+ the sentence ""u r alone now dont come after me"". The HEX code is a** **location** **somewhere in Tibet/China in reverse and also says ""in a red bag"". Could be a birthday prank or a puzzle for my present but I live in Europe. Full breakdown** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/9rtwkx/i_found_a_weird_note_on_my_windshield/e8jpx14)**.**

**EDIT7:**  u/Kennyschieten **says that it could be an organized surprise trip by my friends.**

**EDIT8: Talked to my girlfriend and my best friend, turned out it WAS a birthday puzzle and I'm going to fly to China. They messed up the location though and the red bag was my backpack where I found my tickets!**

The original owner of the llama my friend had booked ghosted him about a week before the wedding. My friend then found another person who had a llama handy with a week to spare. His name is Shocky and he is a very good llama and I love him very much. The suit didn't turn out how I wanted it to, but that's pretty much what everyone says when they make something. All in all, it's been an unforgettable day.


Original post: I've been hired to make a tuxedo for a llama and I don't have it's measurements. I'm also assuming the llama is male.

The measurements needed are: 
Length of legs from just above hoof (ankle?) to bottom of torso
Height from bottom of torso to back of neck
Distance around neck
Width across shoulders

So I have this friend, I went to college and studied abroad with him. So he's decently educated and has lived outside the USA for a while. When he graduated he moved out of the city into more of a rural suburban setting, working remote 5 days per week. I have noticed his views progressively separating from much of his peers.  


Since Covid, he's gone down a bit of a rabbit hole with a lot of right wing ideologies. I made a comment about how expensive groceries are getting, and he just blurts out ""because Biden is a fucking idiot and everyone who voted for him is an idiot"". I commented back that the global economy is a very complex topic, and blaming whoever happens to be sitting in office isn't a fair reasoning, nor saying that people who voted for him are dumb. He just said ""Ever since sleepy joe has been in office, the world has been going to shit, and you cannot change my mind that's not these dumb liberals"". That's just one example. He's had similar outbursts on topics ranging from Roe vs Wade, poverty, women's rights, problems with police and violence in our community, etc. I wanted to go look at a car in the city and asked if he wanted to tag along, He told me I would be cutting my life short by going to that town, as it's crime infested and I'd most likely get shot. (I live in that city).  


He recently opened up to me and told me that he's been pretty lonely, and the dating apps aren't doing it for him. He's tried to approach girls before but he gets shut down/ghosted on a frequent occasion. He asked if I had any friends I could set him up with, as I'm a fairly big extrovert.  
I just told him I didn't know of anyone that would vibe with him super well, which wasn't a complete lie.   


Many of our mutual friends have started uninviting him to certain events, as his overall demeanor isn't very enjoyable to be around. I don't know if I should have a heart to heart with him and tell him that these views that he's adopted making him very unattractive to most people in our field and friend group. Or, should I just leave him be and possibly wait for some girl to tell him?

At one of our last lunches together which was over a year ago, she teased me for wearing a mask. She also says she believes she never had breast cancer. She went through a lumpectomy and chemo and has been in remission for five years yet still states she never had cancer. Once I realized she blocked me I tried to contact her and even went to her house as this relationship is to valuable to just drop without an explanation. She didn’t answer the door. I put a note in her door. Nothing. I’ve asked a couple of friends close to us who, while they are still friends with both of us do not want to get involved. I grieved about this for two months then finally came to the conclusion that she has her reasons. At our last lunch together over a year ago I told her when she has time to call me and we’ll  do lunch. Since it’s been a year and I hadn’t heard, I reached out. Nothing.

I'm wondering why they get so upset, considering that our conversation has nothing to do with them.   If I ask why they get upset, they say it's considered rude.  And nowadays, you run the risk of upsetting a Karen type who will potentially cause a scene or become violent.

I have gone to amusement parks where there are a lot of tourists from different countries and if I hear whole families speaking in their native tongue that I don't understand, my family and I don't get upset or feel threatened.  We actually enjoy hearing different languages and dialects from other countries.

Has she just gotten really lucky or is this actually the normal time a guy should last because I always assumed if you get like 15 minutes out of yourself down there you did a pretty good job lol

I'm always hungry and up for eating snacks so 24/7 I have to be vigilent and make sure I'm not eating too much.

I cook nearly all my meals and it's mostly vegetarian food and limited oil/sugar, I don't drink soda ever, I never eat fast food, I eat junk food occasionally (probably once per week I make a bad decision like eating a bag of crisps), I do drink alcohol but not a crazy amount. I could easily eat like 3x the portion sizes of what I'm supposed to have for each meal, like it might be tofu and rice and veggies but I could eat a lot of it.

Is this just what it will be like for the rest of my life? I have to stay vigilent and think about what I'm eating every day 24/7 or be overweight? Are the thin people around me having to be careful with everything they eat every day and that's how they stay thin?

Edit: It would be useful to know if people responding are men or women as it might be quite different

Edit2: Thanks for all your inputs and helpful advice. I’ve also gotten some weird DMs telling me I’m an idiot for being a vegetarian and a few men asking if I’m pretty, wtf. Anyway I learned a lot from these many comment responses so thanks yall."

I did see some repeated comments I wanted to address. First through the comments y'all've made me realize that I am projecting my own thoughts about the situation & stress on to him thinking I'm going to traumatize him by saying we can't afford it. & By traumatize I mean make him feel food insecurity.. but as I said he'll always eat before us he'll never be hungry. He just may not be happy with the options. I do believe in giving some explanation just because I know it's what I'd want & he takes disappointment better when the reason is given, however I love & I'm going to implement the ""no that's a special treat & special treats aren't in budget"" along with involving him in the grocery list & coming up with some cheaper homemade versions of what he wants & having him help with the cooking. 
2nd as far as the school goes I'm a substitute teacher for the district. We're in the US & I'm not sure if every state is the same.. but we go to a title one public school. Which basically means most of the kids are coming from poverty. The entire district no matter who gets free breakfast & lunch. The reason it's set up to line up the way it is is because they give 2 options for lunch. For example today was chicken Alfredo or ham & cheese sandwich.the kids pick what they want first thing in the morning & then send it to the cafeteria so they know how many of each to prepare. At lunch they line up lunch boxes, the option 1 first then option 2, that way the cafeteria workers aren't slowing down to change what they're doing fixing trays & such. One entire grade goes at the same time. So one teacher will watch & help the kids with lunch boxes, one teacher will watch the kids waiting in line & the 3rd teacher will watch the kids getting their trays and the kids taking it to the table. It's efficient & that's why it's done that way. It's not a single out the poor kid getting a free lunch type deal. 

Edit: wow I didn't expect this big of a response. Thank all of y'all you've been very helpful & supportive. I've been trying my best to reply, but I probably won't reply anymore till tomorrow. Again thank you so much 

We're broke. Money's tight. My son has been asking to bring lunch to school. His reasoning is because lunchboxes line up first. The school provides free lunch & breakfast. We don't really have the money to send a lunch box. We make sure he has enough food. He eats before me or my husband. We've also been making lots of food from scratch & there's been days he's gotten upset because he doesn't want that he wants chicken nuggets or pizza... 
Id like to include him in grocery shopping, but right now we're using the food pantry & when we do go grocery shopping when I take him with me he's wanting stuff like those little bags of muffins, chicken nuggets, pizza, & I just can't afford it.... Any suggestions please I don't want to traumatize him with the truth that we can't afford it but I need him to know he'll always be fed even if it's not exactly what he wants "

wujq13,There’s a woman outside of my house who’s been there for about an hour. She keeps knocking and ringing the bell which sends my dog crazy. I’m 16M home alone and she won’t leave. More below.,19600,0.83,2130,2022-08-22 09:51:11,NoStupidQuestions,4944439,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/wujq13/theres_a_woman_outside_of_my_house_whos_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/wujq13/theres_a_woman_outside_of_my_house_whos_been/,self.NoStupidQuestions,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"My family is at a party and this woman won’t leave. She keeps saying “hello”. She wont leave and keeps knocking frantically. It’s Been at least 45 minutes. What do I do? I’ve barricaded myself in a room with a lock and lacrosse stick.

About an hour and 15 minutes ago I got a call from an unknown number and it was some guy with an Indian accent whispering about if I’ve “gotten my package”. My dog is freaking out to. 

How do I get out of this situation?

EVERYONE THE SITUATION IS ALL TAKEN CARE OF—

She left eventually and I’m ok. If you want the full story it’s in the comments.

UPDATE- Situation is solved. It was a neighbor or something who thought we had her package. Doesn’t really explain why she was there for over an hour and consistently knocking/ringing doorbell/trying to talk but idc. Anyways, thanks for the suggestions and help, I’m ok.

More backstory i guess—

She ordered a laptop when she was on vacation in Europe to our house and told my parents. So that we could like hold on to it when she’s gone so it doesn’t get stolen. She came over tonight and tried to get it from us between 8-10:30 pm without telling my family at all that she was coming. Anyways my family left for a party so I was home alone which leads me back to the original post and all that happened there. For those of you wondering why I didn’t contact my parents, I did. It was one of the first things I did after heading upstairs and barricading myself in with a lacrosse stick. If you don’t know much about lacrosse it hurts a lot to get hit with pads on so I assumed it must really hurt without them. They checked the cameras and couldn’t really see much other than that there was a woman. That’s why I didn’t go to the door. Eventually they tried talking to her through the cameras and it worked. If you’re wondering why she did it or something, we don’t know but we think they have a mental illness or something. Also, with the phone call, I have no idea what that is. I did order some DoorDash tacos that arrived about 20 minutes before the call. But they were delivered by “Amy” and not some middle aged sounding Indian guy. Anyways the guy was whispering and like “did you get your package… did you get your delivery”. And then I asked what he meant and he just said “your package” so I just hung up on the guy. Also I’ve never gotten a call after getting DoorDash delivered. Honestly, it’s probably not connected and I likely won’t learn what was up with that call.

I also was hesitant to communicate with her because my house is in an affluent area above the main part of my city and lots of people (mainly homeless and stuff because my city has an extreme homeless problem) try to come up here and get lucky through things like searching through trash cans, breaking into cars, robbing homes etc. I didn’t want to risk anything like that so I decided staying out was the best option and I had the lacrosse stick if I really needed it.

The neighbors behind me claimed to receive my DoorDash order. I don’t know anything about if they actually got a copy of it or something or if it wasn’t actually for me. I mean I could’ve gotten 2 orders of tacos… 

But anyways, The situation is fixed. The woman went back to her house (laptop-less) and I’m currently laying on the couch responding to all of the comments. Thanks everyone for your help and insightful comments.

I survived the night as well 💪🏼💪🏼

———————————————

At this point I’m basically just getting asked the same stuff over and over so I probably won’t respond unless it’s something new. Plus it’s been almost a day since this happened."

I’m a teacher and I’ve got a kid staying in my house right now because his parents kicked him out when they figured out he was gay. 

He’s such a sweet kid. He loves them dearly. He thought they would let him come home after a week. After two weeks. Then in week three he realized they really truly meant it when they said they never wanted to see him again. He is 16. 

I have kids, and I just don’t understand it. My kid could actually murder someone in cold blood and I would still visit them every day in jail. I just cannot wrap my mind around it. It’s infuriating. 

As a teacher I’ve seen parents disown their children time and again, for a multitude of reasons. I feel like I should know exactly what the thought process is by now. But I still cannot truly wrap my mind around it. 

Can anyone else lend some insight and help me understand it? Because I can’t even half way explain it to him when he asks.

*Edit: Thank you so much for sharing your kind words of support, thoughtful explanations, and most importantly of all, your touching stories. I am deeply moved and better equipped than I’ve ever been to explain this phenomenon not only to this young man, but any student who asks me a similar question again.

I'm an adult and have been living as a trans man for 5 years. I've only been medically transitioning for 4 months but I've started growing facial hair and have a noticably deeper voice. I'm not exactly what you'd call as 'passing' but I'm known by work and friends as my preferred name/ pronouns.

Now that my facial hair has started growing in I feel more comfortable using the correctly gendered bathroom however I've gotten some funny looks. Id like to think they don't care but I really don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable. Using the women's bathroom makes people uncomfortable, I've noticed it and have people ask if I'm in the correct place.

This is all in Australia btw. Do you guys care?

Edit: This blew up! Wow, thank you everyone for your advice and kind words. I will hopefully be able to pee without stress!

Edit 2: Wowowoow. So many responses! Thank you all very much. It seems like nothing to you but it's very nice to hear for me. A massive confidence boost as well. Also thanks for gold!!!

Edit 3: Wow okay, that's a lot of people. I cannot appreciate you all enough. It's crazy how many people are excited to reveal their potty times when asked! Seriously though very funny and insightful responses everyone!"

I’ve been “disowned” or something. They made it really clear they wont be taking me back. Im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

I was able to get my bike from my parents’ since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I’ll have to buy something every few hours so I won’t get kicked out. 

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there’s an app or a website for that I’ll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won’t be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I’m extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I’ve considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. Im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. My situation isnt that bad. And again, thanks to everyone for all the advice"

Long story short, I grew to love both of them.

I'll spare you the very depressing details of my wife's passing but she was sick for over a year and finally she had enough of the treatment.

We brought the cat to the hospital for her to say goodbye. She kind of just sniffed around the room and laid down on a seat.

After my wife died, her behavior is basically the same.

I know this question is so stupid but entertain me.

Even if it's just an article saying ""Cats get sad when they don't see you for 2 days"" or some shit.

I feel like she loves us but there's no object permanence.

Working, trying to exercise, trying to have time for my dog, trying to have a social life, trying to keep up with family, trying to find a date lol all sorts of stuff.

During all that time of stress though I was neglecting myself.  I spent so much time trying to do other things that I didn't really even know who I was... if that makes sense.

During this isolation I have been able to really look introspectively as to who I am as a person 

I have determined that I am a good son to my parents. A good brother to my siblings. An awesome uncle. A good friend.. I look at my dog and I can see the love she has for more me. I've determined that as a whole I am a good person.

I have realized that I can comfortable with who I am. Before I was always trying to fit in with all sorts of things. Now I know more of what my direction and ideals/beliefs, and Interests are.

I was able to indulge in some nostalgia and play some games ive all but forgotten and never really had time to finish. I even busted out the GameCube and nintendo 64, xbox 360 and just indulged in some things I loved from childhood. I even found that peoppe were still even playing Halo 3 and Halo reach online! I had a blast 

I have majorly gotten myself into cooking. Before my meals basically consisted of food from places like chipotle, noodles and company, etc. Now I've realized that when I put my mind to it, homemade food can be fucking delicious. I even plan meals throughout the week based on what ingredients I have!

I have read a lot more. Before I'd be hard pressed to read 1 book a year. I've already read 5 in 2 months.

Most noticeably I've felt less stress about money. I'm getting my normal pay from unemployment, but I'm missing out in spending all that extra money on material good or going out to eat.

I've finally been able to set myself up financially. I'm always i month of rent ahead and I have also been able to put a few thousand dollars into investments. 


I also feel less stress having to hang out with friends. Before i always wouldn't feel very psyched to hang out with friends because I was so tired. Now I dont have to worry about being tired. Plus my friends and I just chat over the phone. So im.still keeping up without having to maintain a physical presence 

I've realized I actually hate my job and am shifting my goals elsewhere.

Idk i mean obviously I haven't been this happy the whole time. But once I realized more and more that this is the new normal for a while it kinda shifted me on from stressing out about the virus, to redirecting me in a different direction in life and making me realize the positives I have to offer as well as the negatives and how I can turn those negatives to positives.

Sorry if this was a long read, it just felt really good putting my thoughts into words

**Quick edit: Wow! Wasn't expecting my 1AM word vomit to get so much attention**

For those of you who are struggling (which simply based off of comments on this post) I know is the majority, I have a favor to ask of you.

Today, I want you to just turn your phone off, turn notifications off and shut that part of your life off. Phones these days are just the harbinger of negative news. Constant Flashing headlines and beeps of negativity. When you are already in a down mindset, having negative things constantly getting shoved in your face is not going to help.

If you are able, just remove yourself from your phone and get nice and comfortable on a couch or a bed with a cup of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc and watch your favorite movie, play your favorite game, or read a book. Remove that negativity and instead replace it with something positive that you know you enjoy. Even if its just for a day, having nothing but positives and relaxation will do wonders for your health. 

For those who are struggling with loved ones who have COVID,  I am so sorry you are going through this right now. I know hopes and prayers are a dumb thing, but given that I'm just a random stranger on reddit, that's all I can give. I will hope and pray that your loved ones make it through.

If any of you are in an abusive relationship be it family, or a significant other, please understand that you are worth more than that. For some of you I know it is not easy or maybe not even possible to escape that situation right now. But you are worth more than the abuse, be it physiological, mental, or physical. If you are in need of help, use the site below.

If you have someone who monitors your phone, use incognito mode so it won't show up on search histories.

There’s this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she’s looking through my social media profiles, won’t stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I’ve since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded “don’t you like to be touched?” to which I responded “not by you”. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said “no chance”. 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said “I’m only joking” before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn’t present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said “dude, isn’t that basically sexual assault?” I responded “is it?” He said “man, she literally molested you and tried again” 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she’ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I’m a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn’t taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I’d be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

So female sexuality is already looked down on when it comes to masturbation (which is still a mystery to me as to why,) but what is wrong with masturbation if it works as an effective form of birth control, you’re not creating any soul ties with anyone(spiritual bonds/ties formed through sexual intercourse) and you’re not getting into trouble assuming that it’s not an addiction?

I thoroughly enjoy masturbating and I feel no guilt afterwards like I used to when I was younger and new to it."

My family and most of my friends reacted confused or even laughed at me because ""I wont get far with this mindset"" and similar things. I may have to add that I was already very overqualified for the job I am doing and I already got a lot of shit for that.

They mentioned ""being stagnant and lazy"", ""you wont grow like that"" or ""with your potential you have to aim higher"" and more.

Now I kind of agree with them (not 100%) but why is this a bad thing? I like who I am at the moment. I like helping my coworker who maybe didnt have the same education I did. Also I hated the stressful time during University.

It even surprises me more that with the climate change and overpopulation becoming more and more serious people still dont understand that maybe just be content with what we have is also a good thing.

Edit: I guess stagnation was the wrong word. Maybe ""not being ambitious"" is the better fitting term."

But i can't help but noticing that my close guy friends have not even reached out to us for a visit. And i talk to them regularly online and whatsapp. 

When the baby was a week old, I've invited them to come visit us and their replies sounded positive. But now its been 2 months. 

This feels weird and I dont want to remind them or come across as desperate. 
They know how important this birth was. 


My wife and I lost 3 2nd trimester children in the past 3 years. So having a healthy baby means the world to us. 
Everyone in our social circle was supportive. But the lack of interest of my guy friends seems odd. And in high contrast with girl friends we have. 

So, do dudes just dont come to see babies? Even if they know the struggle their close friends had?"

I love baseball, was my first game. During the national anthem me and my girlfriend we got caught of guard when everybody stand up when the anthem started, we had our hands full with our drinks and food. We just kept sitting down, not really saying anything, but we immediately start to feel that people were staring at us, shaking their heads. It felt uncomfortable AF. When the anthem ended a lot of people in the stands just started looking at us, a full section of people just looking like we stole something, some of them yelled things, the lady next to me said ""what's wrong with you?"", one person said ""Please have some respect!"" among other things.

Really made us feel really uncomfortable and unwelcome, when we didn't mean to disrespect people like that. lasted a couple of minutes but made the game feel awkward at the begging, i did learn my lesson and stand up in ""God bless America"" tho...

Is it that bad to do that? Im not American.

Edit: for the people sending ugly messages just to clarify it was my first game with GF i know i didn’t express that correctly in my post. Also, the other times i went never got on time to the national anthem. I remember going to the old stadium an as far as i remember didn’t get any shit like my last game. Im still curious, as i don’t want to disrespect people. I don’t know if that changes anything of my original question. 

Some of the messages i have received are ridiculous, borderline toxic nationalism. I didn't want to make a riot between Left vs right, or whatever it's going on in your country, im just an outsider, asking a question. Sort it out yourselves, i don't want to take part on this fight as the United States it's not my country, and every nation has some tense between people, im no one to judge what's going on, as this doesn't not affect my life. I was asking a question and got my answer, i will definitely stand up next time out of respect.

Edit 2: people are going to my latest comments and replying that i kill myself, also a lot of unread messages about that are atrocious. Seriously people, i came here with an osbervation/question, i was left again with the same impression i felt in the game, you are into some North Korea/china/Russia shit. I don't know how can you even have to gut to critique those regimes when a simple question makes you so fucking angry that you tell me to kill myself, go back to my country (whish btw, im already back in my country), never come back. Im not generalizing, im sure there's plenty of sane people in America, but some of you are drinking that nationalism Kool-Aid no different from a dictatorship."

I am a nice guy (edit: Nice Guy ^TM, not genuinely nice guy)


I am nice to women in hopes they will, eventually, see me as a romantic partner. And even though I don't pursue any romance with them and just continue being nice and hope they'll make the first move, I get very angry when they completely see me as a friend. Thankfully though, I don't lash out at them and just rant about it on 4chan- and even slowly cutting contact with my failed targets.



After my most recent episode, I suddenly realized that I am a ""nice guy"" and immediately asked myself what the hell am I doing. I've been getting angry at a woman for seeing me as a friend despite me not doing anything to further our relationship.



 I realized I have been extremely idiotic. 



I guess my teen brain thought since women always moan about wanting a nice guy, I thought that if I was a nice guy, they'd immediately jump on me. But now I realize that's not the case.



What do I do now? How do I fix my thinking when it comes to romantic relationships? And especially on women? I understand they're just humans like us and have their strengths and weaknesses. But a conflicting part of me believes they're all whores.


I am sorry if this post upsets anyone. I genuinely want to change my ways before it's too late (don't wanna be like this in my 20s, 30s, and so on) but I have no idea where to start. How do you even repair a worldview?

I appreciate it as your comments have really opened up my mind and made me realize how toxic my thinking really is. Heck, in this post alone, I  subconsciously referred to women as targets and subhuman. Hopefully I'll be able to fix/change this thinking soon.

Edit: thanks for the early replies. I know the perspective about the US millennials and economy can be discussed forever (and it is all the time) so I am hoping to get a perspective on the view of other countries and their age group.

Edit #2: good morning! I haven't been able to read all the comments, but the input is from all over the world and I didn't realize how much interest people would take in this post. I asked the question with a genuine curiosity and no expectations. To those who are doing well at a young age compared to your parents and wanted to comment, you should absolutely be proud of yourselves. It seems that this has become the minority for many parts of the world. I will provide an update with some links to news stories and resources people posted and some kind of summary of the countries. It will take me a bit, so it won't be as timely as I'd like, but I promise I'll post an update. Thanks everyone!

UPDATE****
I summarized many of the initial responses, there were too many to do them all. Find the results here (ignore the terrible title): https://imgur.com/CSx4mr2

Some people asked for links to information while others wanted to provide their own, so here they are as well.

Update 10/29: After rehearsal I caught him alone and asked what size shoe he was. He answered eight? after a little while and I explained that I had gotten some shoes a while back that didnt fit and was wondering if he would like them. He said he was fine and that the only reason he didnt have new ones was because he was too lazy to get them. I told him that he didnt have to take them but it would be a help since theyve been sitting in my car for ""like a week"". He changed his mind and took them off me, saying he'd try them on and just say he bought a new pair. Thank you all for helping me figure out what to do and sorry if its confusing or written poorly.

I go to the ATM, it's one of those outside ATMs. There's no one around, it's 1am on a Monday and dead quiet. Also cold af. I make the withdrawal for $60 and it spits out $90 (in all $10 bills too, which is strange because they usually give $20s).

I counted it over more than twice. Yup, that's $90 all right. I check my account on my phone, and it says only $60 was withdrawn.



......out of curiosity I do it again, to see what would happen. Same amount, $60. But the second time it gave me the correct amount.


I went home. Now here I sit $30 richer.


I know I'm not supposed to keep it but... there was realistically nothing I could do at the moment. It was 1am, an outside ATM, the adjacent business was closed and no one around.

I truly thought the US was ""the best"" and no other country could remotely compare.

That realization led to a further revelation... I know next to nothing about ANY country except America. 12+ years of history and I've learned nothing about other countries – only a bit about them if they were involved in wars. But America was always painted as the hero and whoever was against us were portrayed as the evildoers. I've just been questioning everything I've been taught growing up. I feel like I've been ""brainwashed"" in a way if that makes sense? I just feel so disgusted that many history books are SO biased.

I am on a diet (and have a biggest loser competition at work), but I will definitely do this tomorrow, diet be damned.  I am still as curious as I was when it started.  I'll have my wife as a spotter to make sure I don't die.  I will probably use wonderbread since that is the consensus ""bread"", even though I feel like I should try multiple breads.  I'll probably post the link here, but I also need to know where I can post the youtube link as a follow up so everyone can watch this go down.  

I am equally psyched and afraid of what might happen, that is going to destroy my insides.  Let's do this!

PS. I will have this filmed and post it on youtube with links.  Not gonna be happy, but I will post video evidence whenever I can, maybe even the poopy (gross).

Update #2: I'll be buying bread later today and doing this. I'll post a link here to YouTube with the process. Two questions: What sub should I post it in, in addition to linking it here? And is there any free video editing software, for trimming any boring parts, or blurring anything out (in case I have like a letter with my name and address out and I realize after the fact)?

Thanks everyone! 

Update #3: I just completed the video recording of this and will be uploading it to YouTube shortly. I'll post the link here but I'll have to post a link to it in a new post somewhere too, I can't let this go to waste.

Update #4:  Okay, the video exists!  I didn't watch the entire thing, but I made sure it was full.  Please be gentle, this isn't r/roastme!  I posted it at the videos subreddit.  The link is https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/apbdaq/squishing_an_entire_loaf_of_bread_and_trying_to/ and I will follow up one last time on here later with how I feel afterwards.

Whenever he comes over to my apartment to hang out I ask him to take off his pants when he’s sitting on my bed (no outside clothes on the bed). So because he doesn’t wear underwear he ends up being completely naked from the waist down and gives me a hard time if I ask him to put on shorts. We argue about this every time he comes over, I think it’s so weird that he does this but he thinks it’s completely normal. Am I overreacting?

Edit: I did not realize this topic would spark such a heated debate in the comment section lol 
To clarify, I give him shorts or pajama pants to change into if we’re going to be in my bed for an extended period of time. 

We also live in NYC, where there are all kinds of germs on the subway and sidewalk. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask that he not track that onto my bed where I sleep every night."

In the UK the vast majority of schools start between 8:30am and 9:00am, finishing around 3:30pm. For example, my school started at 8:45am and finished at 3:15pm.

I couldn’t fathom leaving the house, as a teenager with messed up circadian rhythms, before 8am! I’m not sure how it’s done in the rest of the world, but it seems fairly cruel.

***Edit***
Thank you everyone for your responses, super interesting! It seems that the UK may be the exception, as schools across the world seem to start early too. 
I have to say, although a lot of people seem to say that the extra time in the afternoon was appreciated, I still prefer the UK timings!

***Edit***
Just another note, I’ve seen so many comments about universities starting classes at 7:30/8am. Anyone who attended a UK university can imagine how horrendously difficult it would be to drag a hungover 18 year old, with no parental guidance, into a 7:30am lecture! My university was hesitant to run 9am classes just because attendance was so poor when they did, never mind any earlier!"

I'll see what I can do to help him more; ask his family to help out with the paperwork so he doesn't have to worry about that, figure out what his comfort food is and make that for him, and be there all the time. I'm going to stay at his place for a few days, or at least until he tells me to leave if he chooses to do that, to make sure he's doing as well as someone in his situation could be.

Edit 1: Thanks for the quick response, friends. So I guess the answer is yes, people do actually do this. I understand people's reasoning for it, and I get why a lot of people dislike spam calls so much. I think I'm just used to getting calls from numbers I've never seen before due to work, so I've learned to live with the occasional spam call. Thanks again.  

Edit 2: After reading more comments, it seems like getting a large number of spam calls is a bigger problem in the US. I live in the UK and I probably get one spam call every two weeks. If I were to get the volume of spam calls our American friends get then maybe I'd screen my calls more strictly too."

My friends birthday is in a few months and she adores Starbucks, so when all the stores reopen I really want to buy her a drink. However the last time I tried ordering there, there was a huge queue of impatient/busy people behind me, the barista got irrated at my lack of knowledge and I messed up the pronouncatuon of the drink size so I ended up having a panic attack in the bathrooms. So could someone please run me through the ordering processes, and how to prounce the drink size names? Thank you!


Edit: Okay, wow I was not expecting this to get so many replies, thank you all so much for answering, it's incredible. 

A few think this is a shit post and have addressed my anxiety in the comments, either says it's fake or that I'm over exaggerating. So I'll explain a little more, 
I'm going to brush over the details, but my anxiety is linked with my depression, so if I have a depressive period then my anxiety will get worse. In this situation I was not in a good place because of my own mental health issues and some family issues that have been ongoing, so when I decided to order from Starbucks, I was having a really tough time. The panic attack itself wasn't directly linked to the fact that I was in Starbucks or that I messed up my order but rather just triggered everything else that was happening, and made the situation a lot worse than it really was. I wanted to ask for some help on reddit, because I struggle going back to places that I've had panic attacks, and so I can't say how thankful I am to those that have replied with suggestions and pronunciation tips. 

A few of you suggested downloading the app or writing the order down but I want to go in and physically order the drinks, to prove to myself that my anxiety doesn't always have to impact my life. 
Some of you also seemed concerned about the extent of my anxiety, I know that it's bad and that panic attacks are not normal which is why I do have help for it because it isn't just a sole issue, its connected to a lot of other stuff that has gone on in my life. I find these issues kinda hard to talk about, so it makes progress slow however some of you suggested some stuff that may help so I'll definitely go look in to that.


Edit: Most of you are truely amazing and I wish I could thank you all personally for being so kind and  supportive. You're all offering your own experiences or tips and I'm desperately trying to read them all. 
However I just want to state for those commenting that I'm not an advatisment for Starbucks or in it for Karma? (I literally don't know what that is) I downloaded reddit yesterday because I heard its a good place to ask questions, gives you better answers than other platforms and has an amazing community. I really did not expect the post to get this much attention."

I'm not sure if I'm bi or what, but I honestly don't think I'd be happy marrying and spending my life with a man. 

Should be a simple matter of just starting to date women, right? Well, I've been openly gay so long that it would look really weird to my family and friends if I showed up with a girlfriend suddenly. Also, how would I explain to her that I thought I was gay for ten years? How do I even go about straight dating?

I feel such a fool for only starting to figure this all this out at the age of 24. I even have a boyfriend right now, who I would call one of my best friends, though at least he's aware that I think I might not be completely gay. 

I'm at a complete loss for what to do.

I was walking my dog when i saw a heated argument go down between a young boy and a young girl right infront of my apartment door. While my dog was taking a shit i heared her scream „let me go!“ and stuff but he was holding both her hands hindering the girl from walking away. Then when he slept her in the face, i let a loud whistle off and yeld to let her go. He looked at me and said some profanities but didnt let her go. So i walked very close with my dog who happens to look a bit threatening, which scared him off and he stopped holding her. I asked the girl if she wants to walk with me a bit tonget away from him and she agreed. While we walked away, the kid yelled „i‘ll remeber your face, i’ll look for you and im gonna beat you the fuck up when i find you without your dog!“ 

While i walked the girl a few blocks away, i talked to her a bit. Both of them were 14 years old (!) and the kid is apparently a huge troublemaker and lives a few houses further. Apperntly comes from a very troubled family.

When she felt safe and the dude was nowhere to see, i let her alone and went back home. But there he was, right infront of my door waiting. I, a 30yearold 1.9m big guy, didn‘t feel threatened and just smiled at him while i entered my home with my dog. He also smiling back at me, making gestures suggesting that he wants to beat me up like in a bad oldschool highschool movie with bullies. 

I laughed about it at first. But this happened yesterday and the kid is still infront of my door waiting for me everytime i go outside with my dog. Im not scraed to get hurt or anything, he is like 1.5m small and im a big guy. But i mean what am i supposed to do? I guess i go to prison if i defend myself against a 14 yearold, if he really wants a fight, right? I guess i could just leave the house with my dog to just keep him away. But what would be the best corse of action if it really would come to an encounter without my dog and he actually tries to attack me or smthn, before i manage to find out who his parents are?

Tl;dr: 14 yearold kid camps my apartment door to beat me up. And i, a 30yearold big guy, would like to deescalate without going to prison."

I could write pages about that dog, but I’ll keep it short.

I left my understaffed job in the middle of my shift to go spend his final moments with him. 

When I got there, I was still in shock, I had no idea what was wrong with him - it hadn’t set in. It was the first and only time he didn’t wag his tail when he saw me. I just hugged the shit out of him, and encouraged him to lie down. He hesitated but then lay down in my lap. I tried not to cry, but his breathing was so laboured, I knew he was suffering. We then put him down, he passed in my arms.

Afterwards I learned that his lungs were filling with fluid. Before I got there, he was anxious, stressed, coughing and gasping for every breath. I had no idea, when I got there, he was so calm with me, and never coughed once. And he lay in my lap, a severley disadvantageous position for breathing, which most likely caused a lot of distress, just to calm me down and give me one final snuggle.

Fuck man, I loved that dog

I’m honestly a little too overwhelmed to respond right now, but I’ll try to go through as many comments and messages as I can when I’m able to.

To anyone asking if I have a gofundme set up, I am touched but I do not feel comfortable accepting donations for myself online. The cost of his veterinary bills and cremation is already covered. If my story has moved you or made you think of your own pets, and you would like to donate, it would mean a lot to me if you could consider donating to the humane society or a similar organization in his name.

jnibbp,"In the ""I told my child I ate their Halloween candy"" prank, people praise the kids who ""forgive"" their parents.

Let me get this straight, we teach our kids that it's wrong to steal, that you get punished if you steal and you will return your stolen property to the rightful owner....but when parents outright lie to their kids, telling them they stole their children's property, the kids are *not* supposed to ask for their property back?


Growing up, I never was taught ""stealing is wrong and you will be punished for it. But if somebody steals from you, you are *not* supposed to ask for your property back, and you are *not* supposed to expect the thief to be punished for it"".


So if stealing is wrong, why do we expect our children to *not* ask for their property to be returned to them?"

*[Didn’t expect this to blow up! Thank you for all your perspectives. I learned so much today. This is the first time I’ve ever heard of gender dysphoria/euphoria, and I think it makes more sense to me now. I realized my assumption below is flawed - having certain characteristics or liking certain things that fall under “men” or “women” traits isn’t the reason that people are trans.*

*I’ve heard from some of you that perhaps it’s the other way around - that it’s the societal binary gender norms that forces all of us into identifying within certain boxes. It’s great to hear from trans people themselves. I realized that I may not fully understand but am trying my best to. Thank you for educating me and having an open discussion about this.]*

For example, biological man wants to become a woman. She likes dresses and feels more feminine than other average males, so she identifies more as a “woman.” But to associate wearing dresses and being more feminine as “woman” traits just reinforces the societal gender norms that women have to be feminine and women wear dresses.

So, in a way, doesn’t being a transgender (wanting to change to another categorized gender) reinforce this societal binary norms of being a male and being a female?

Alternatively, she could still be her own person - and identify as her biological sex (male) - that is feminine and likes dresses.

This would break the societal norm of what it is to be a “man.”"

I was flabbergasted by this comment and explained to him that not all gaming is a World of Warcraft and Call of Duty time suck. The Last of Us Part 1 for example is like a 10-12 hour long game, which is basically a season of a TV show. It's not open world like GTA, so you really have to follow the linear path of the story. You can break it up into 1-2 hour sessions and play it like you would watch a weekly TV show. Or binge it in two sittings in one weekend like I did. After the story is over the game is done.

If you have time to watch a TV show, you have time to game. Especially most story driven linear single player games, they're all more or less similar in length. And with subscriptions like GameFly and Gamepass it pretty much costs the same as a streaming subscription as well.

I wonder why people got this idea that gaming has to be some disproportionate time commitment."

The girl keeps writing to me and i politely answer. I'm sure she expects a second date and i could just tell her that i didn't think the date went well (lie). Or i could tell her the real reason and maybe make her update her dating pictures so future dates won't feel lied to like i felt."

Because there was no anesthesia, doctors were praised for being quick (or so I’ve heard).  Wouldn’t a guillotine be super fast and efficient?

Edit: thanks for all the great replies!
From what I’ve seen, it seems there are 4 main reasons:

1. Amputations aren’t a straight perpendicular cut, the doctor needs to leave a flap of skin to seal up the wound

https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ioxvbl/why_werent_guillotines_used_for_amputations/g4hagal/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

2. The guillotine is large and impractical to transport, so since most amputations were done (during the world wars at least) on a battlefield, there was no access to them. - never mind, very few were done right on the battlefield. They were mostly done in field hospitals far behind the frontline.

3. The guillotine’s blade is large, dull and hard to sharpen. It was only effective against the head because it would wedge between the vertebrae. Against normal bone it would likely smash and splinter it.

4. The guillotine’s blade is large, dull and often failed to chop even heads off first try sometimes.

Edit 2: My karma has more than quintupled.  Thanks!

Edit 3: apparently it *is* a thing! Though very rare. Sometimes it is used as the first cut in a series, so the more precise ones would come after."

I've seen so many people happy of their coming out (which is great, by the way! I'm not disparaging it *at all*), but I never really 'came out'. Just mentioned it nonchalantly when it was relevant, as if I was just talking about my favourite colour.



Edit: Since a fair few people are asking, for reference I am 21 years old (and a pan guy)

Edit II: Since a fair few more people are asking - pansexual is the possible attraction to all gender identities and sexes, while bisexual is just for the main two gender identities and sexes. They are, by definition, not the same thing since the prefix pan means 'all' while bi means 'two'"

I was dorming in my college at the time and it was right after being raped. I had everything planned out and ready but decided I wanted to smoke one last cigarette. I didn't try and hide the fact that I was also self harming at the time because honestly I wanted people to see I was hurting.

As I sat outside to smoke another student walked up to me. I noticed that he saw my scars but instead of running away he sat down next to me. We never talked before but he started the conversation like it was nothing to him. We talked for a few hours from school to anime to gaming. For once I didn't feel completely alone. At the end of the conversation he told me that if I felt stressed and like games I should play a specific one. As soon as I got into my room I put my razors away and loaded up the game. Ended up playing all night.

He doesn't know he saved my life. Throughout these years I've gone back and forth between messaging him and thanking him. I don't want to come off weird or as though I'm expecting something. Especially since he has a gf now and I have a bf I don't want to cause any unnecessary drama.

Do you guys see any cons of me messaging him and thanking him after all these years? Should I just let it go?


Edit 1: I ended up messaging him. The message is in the comments. He actually just told me that it helped him immensely because he's in the same place I was. I'm near tears right now and just trying to be a good friend and listen to him.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking what game it is and it's called Katawa Shoujo. It's a game where you date disabled girls. A warning though, the sex scenes are pretty graphic.

Edit 3: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice! It means a lot and every comment has left a smile on my face. 💜 Just remember I am here if anyone needs someone to talk to you. Every life matters and you are needed in this world."

My daughter loves to dance and at school she and her friend do ""TikTok Dances"" which they love but none of them actually have TikTok due to their age. They must learn them from older siblings or something.

I've made a TikTok account on my phone so I can try and find videos of dances to show my daughter to learn and take back to her friends but I just don't know where to start, where to look, what to search.

Are there particular TikToks, or TikTokkers, I should be following to find out the dances? 

Is that how you learn the dances?

Please help out a clueless dad who wants to make his daughter happy.

Update: Thanks for all the love and helpful comments everyone. I've managed to find some great tutorials for the dances so all is sorted. My daughter is going to be so excited when I pick her up from school and tell her what we're going to be doing tonight!

I know there is a lot of concern when it comes to TikTok, particularly children and TikTok but rest assured that that is one of the main reasons I came here - to make sure I'd be getting good advice to find the good stuff and not the naughty stuff.

My daughter and her friends don't even know what ""TikTok"" is, they think it's just a name to describe dances that involve moving your arms and hands etc. haha

So, to summarise, thanks so much for the help and the rewards and don't worry; she won't be seeing anything inappropriate or posting videos on there."

When going through who he followed on instagram, I noticed he was following a lot of Andrew Tate pages. When I confronted him about it, and asked if he supported him, he said yes, because Tate was teaching him to be an 'alpha.' This immediately threw me off, but I've known this guy for a few years and I don't want to throw it away over something like this. When I tried to talk more about it, he told me to drop it and not to worry about it, which obviously rang a lot of warning bells in my head. I'm keeping him at arms length for now, but he's moving back to town in a few weeks and I'm concerned for both myself and him, since the area I live in is filled with negative people that would just cement his thinking. Should I just drop him? This opportunity is genuinely a dream come true for me, but he's shown way too many red flags so far that it feels kinda hopeless.

Edit: I'm going to avoid him for a while, and only talk to him if he starts the conversation. I won't be pursuing a relationship with him, I didn't really want a relationship with him to begin with. Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and helped me out, I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did.Everyone telling me to run, the moment I see any hint of misogyny or sexism, I'll be blocking him. He still has access to me via facebook messenger, so if he wants to talk to me at all, to apologise or otherwise, he can do it through there. As far as I know he's still moving to town, and if he wants to be friends I'll be fine with that, but he'll have to endure the 'friend test.' My best friend is an amazing judge of character, and they will be making a verdict once they meet him in person.I hope that he can see the error in following such a person, and once the heat dies down I'll be sending him some examples of better men to look up to (i.e. Jack Black, Markiplier, Daz Black, Jacksepticeye etc.) Any other respectful men I can send over to him as a better father figure would be greatly appreciated.Thank you so much to everyone who has helped me made a decision, I appreciate the concern and genuine advice everyone has given me. Hopefully he's not active on reddit and doesn't see this, that'd be an interesting conversation.  


SECOND EDIT!  
I messaged him asking if I can just be a mate, and play video games and just be chill, and he immediately turned it into a pity party, blamed me for him being depressed, threatened me, said I was 'nothing compared to him' and said he was going to send members from a gang after me. I have the entire conversation screenshotted, and will keep them if I have to file a police report.   
He couldn't handle me actually having a backbone I guess."
1dggvvb,I am going to smell for the first time. What should I expect?,15639,0.93,8161,2024-06-15 17:58:54,NoStupidQuestions,4944439,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1dggvvb/i_am_going_to_smell_for_the_first_time_what/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1dggvvb/i_am_going_to_smell_for_the_first_time_what/,self.NoStupidQuestions,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I was born with an internally messed up nose. It looks fine externally maybe a slight asymmetry but the real issue with it is it caused weaker breathing and deviated septum and a complete loss of smell. I will have to have 3 surgeries done on the nose to address the multiple different issues in August. I truly have never smelled a single scent in my life. I am soon to get a surgery to fix my messed up nose and the airways but also with a very good chance I can smell for the first time ever. I am 23 as well. What I am asking is simple.

1. What should I expect?
2. What should I do?
3. What should I smell good and bad?
4. Does anyone know how life could change from your own theory and hypothesis.
5. Truly how hard and insane will this affect my mind basically adding on a sense I’ve never experienced once in childhood, teenage years and truly never?

Edit: was not at all expecting this response. This stuff must be crazy that I’m missing out on. If you have a specific question just message me privately as I tried replying to as many as I could but this response is crazy. I am reading all of this but in practice I have no idea what any of the descriptions I am getting could feel like without experiencing it. I believe my surgery is mid August with recovery being grueling and I will for sure find a way to update everyone and possibly have a AMA.
Some quick facts too about my hopes and past with this
1. I want to smell vanilla more than anything.
2. I want to smell the worst smells there is for experience 
3. Tons of foods I can eat super easily because I have no smell or do things like take medicine and alcohol easily with no bad taste
4. My mother and grandfather both had similar nose issue. Grandfather didn’t care nor do I believe had the ability to get it fixed, my mother got it fixed ten years ago to success. So I have some hope but mine is definitely the worst especially in regard to smell/breathing.
4. Just message me for anything else

I am having 3 things operated on in the nose in August to address all my issues.

Also for anyone asking, there’s no absolute guarantee to fix smell just a good chance. The surgeries are truly more important to fix my shallow breathing and nerve issues. 

Edit 2: If anyone has a good way to update all of yall interested in some months from now let me know by private message on how to go about this. Could do it here, AMA or some other way. Did not expect this many people interested."

I pay $250 rent to cover my expenses and am a full time handyman lol. I dont necessarily mind living together, she lets me do anything I want, but the privacy would be nice. 

The only issue is the market is absolutely terrible right now. A 2+ BR rental in my area (CT) usually goes for $700-800 a person per month (before utilities), and I just cant stomach paying that much just to live in a different house than my mom. With other bills such as student loans & car insurance, it makes it difficult to budget for an expense like that. Especially considering my student loan payment is close to being a rental payment...

I guess I'm just curious what others my age are doing for their living situations. My friends are looking to move and me moving with them would make it a lot easier, but I just feel like its kind of a stupid move financially. It seems like im moving out moreso because of the stigma than my own well-being. 

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!









**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for all the input and rewards lol. It is super appreciated. This turned out to be a lot more helpful than intended. Hopefully it helped some other people as well. I really just wanted to get an understanding of what people my age are doing in these rough times, and you guys did an amazing job illustrating that. 

Seems like ~99% of people find it to be okay given the circumstances. I think my plan is to save up one more year and see where we're at. If the market is good I just may be able to get myself a house!

Once again, feedback much appreciated. Although I didnt get to respond to a lot of people, i read almost every notification I got, and I hope everything works out for you guys. Its nice to have people for reassurance.

Advice please?! 

*Stove is a properly installed and vented pellet stove. No chance of carbon monoxide poisoning. 

UPDATE. He went home 6 hrs after initial discovery. I wish I had a more positive update. My child has always referred to him as Rico. Doesn’t know his last name and I come to find out Rico isn’t his name. It’s his nickname. After hearing the child’s actual name, I do know OF the family. It’s not a giant community. About a decade ago his parents made false accusations against their childcare provider. I know for a fact these accusations were ridiculous and medically impossible, but cost the childcare provider $134,000 to prove their innocence. Rico’s older sibling is transgender and the parents were taking the stand of “they were born a girl and they’ll die a girl”. The childcare providers husband was targeted because they didn’t judge. Years before that they made accusations against another six year old peer and caused that family to flee the community. This changes things dramatically and although his parents thought he was somewhere else last night I must proceed with caution and protect my family."

I know Tumblr, which is super old, has posts over a million, and not just in total notes (likes + reblogs) but in just likes - [such as this one](https://snookeroo.tumblr.com/post/645001027210346496/lionowlonao3-lucyheartfiliaxxnatsudragneel), with 1.1 mil likes

Twitter has a bunch, and although they are political, reddit also hosts a bunch of political subreddits that often get to popular. 

Instagram also has a few, eg. Kylie Jenner Baby post. I feel like this is my biggest reason for my confusion since Instagram doesn't really have a big 'popular content' page, like all the other platforms. People seek that out to like, which i feel like could easily happen with reddit and its Hivemind. 

So I guess i just want to know why a website with such an active and connected userbase hasn't had a post with over a million upvotes yet?"

Like, could I somehow dry everything (but how?) And then use baking soda?

.

Update kinda: I believe this post is now locked

So I legitimately didn't realise how bad the situation was until you kind, wonderful members of the internet made me realise, so thank you for that. It was emotionally overwhelming to sort of realise the reality of the situation, I think on some level I knew, but must have been in denial or something. It has been one of the most emotionally difficult days of my life, and I just truly want to say thank you to each of you for being there. 

In regards to the bed, right now, considering everything, the bed is the least of my worries. Emotionally I am exhausted, I am fragile and I need time to digest this situation. So, feel free to judge, but I have left it and I'm sleeping on it. When things are this bad, sleeping on a wet bed is the least of my concerns. I will sort the bed out tomorrow. I will do my best to respond asap. But for now, I need to sleep. 

Thank you x"

My mother thinks you can only fit a couple thousand, my father thinks billions, my siblings think trillions and I think maybe a few million at the most, couple hundred thousand at the least. It’s sparked so much tension in my house nearly two fights have broken out since, and at least one screaming match between my sister and brother. I would really like a definitive answer, so if you can provide one please do so. Thanks.


Edit: I feel like I need to clarify a few things, as some people have expressed concern over my family’s passion about this issue. These aren’t actual screaming matches and fights, it’s more just laughter and yelling. The only actual fight that broke out was between my nine year old brother and twelve year old sister, because my brother wouldn’t stop yelling about how the bees are tiny and the car is big, so you could definitely fit a trillion. My dad might’ve been joking and then just stuck with it, or he might just be stubborn and dumb. We all love each other, and I’m certain they’ll get a kick out of the fact that I now have an actual answer. Speaking of, this has become a popular enough thing that it actually shows up when you google it, so yay.




GREAT NEWS! I HAVE BROKEN SAID GREAT NEWS TO MY FAMILY DECLARING MY VICTORY OVER THEM IN THE BEE ESTIMATE! While my father wasn’t entirely wrong, as you could fit 955,209,177 Peridita Minima bees in a Lexus GX, credit to Davor_Penguin for that. The most convincing answer for this question regarding honeybees comes from JillandherHills, who says that 6,351,111 honey bees could fit into the interior space of a Lexus. Smug as I am about my victory, my father feels slightly nettled being so far off from his estimate for a honeybee, and I doubt the fact that the smallest bee in the world is still a little less than five million away from just 1 billion is any consolation. My brother has begun to reevaluate his concept of a trillion, though he’s nine so I’ll give him some leeway for being so far off. My mother was never really into this in the first place, so she’s not very put off about being wrong. My sister is, to say the least, not happy."

Some people have to ask what it is, and it only takes, like, 2 extra seconds to do, and I’m very proud of it.

I started doing it years ago because I had the realization that nobody could stop me. There’s no where in the law that says I can’t do it, plus, I really love dragons. I’ve never looked back since then. I even drew it on my driver’s license and other legal documents since then and haven’t experienced any problems yet. It’s not like I’m gonna get arrested for some extra lines at the end of my name, and what’s the government gonna do? Judge me? People have told me “you can’t do that,” but I haven’t really heard any reason with an external consequence.

Anyways, I’m in college now, and I’m at this point wondering if this is something I should continue. In my eyes, it’s something completely harmless that gives me enjoyment, but I’ve been thinking maybe I should stop as I am developing into a professional. Developing into a professional is especially important as I’m in music education to become a band director, and (as with most things but even more so for educators) a good standing with colleagues and students is supremely important, so it makes me wonder if I should cut it out with the dragon as to not appear childish to potential employers and other musicians in my profession. I personally don’t thing it’s childish- I think it’s completely harmless- but perhaps I’m being blind sighted. Could it actually have an impact on my future career and the respect I demand?

Sorry that was long, but any input would be appreciated.

TL;DR, I quickly draw a dragon next to my name both in print and in my signatures. To me, it’s completely harmless, but could it have an impact on my future career or some other unforeseeable consequence?

EDIT: Oh dang, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. Thank you everybody for your advice and input! Lots of people have asked for the dragon, so here he is. (This is not the full signature, for obvious reasons.)

EDIT 2: Not that anybody knows unless I tell them, but the dragon’s name is Leeroy."

I used the term “gaslight” because I knew for a fact she was wrong, but the way she kept insisting made me believe I was wrong about some detail.

The whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that Steven Crowder guy from the meme). You see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

Don't get me wrong, I think they are tools. I'm not trying to bait discourse, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

But I never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. Hell I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

Again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. I don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image Ben shapiro seems to commercialize"

I've been in situations where I shared a room for a week or two and that is manageable, but I feel like anything longer than a few weeks and I would suffocate. I'm fairly outgoing, good with people, but I just need a certain amount of time a day that I spend completely alone on my room with no social interaction whatsoever. Without that, I wouldn't be happy.

So how do people manage? Do you just accept not having actual, private alone time or do you somehow get that elsewhere? If you come back to your room and there's a sock on the door, do you just sleep on a park bench? How does all of that work?

My question is, do we warn them? I don’t want them to be freaked out. I’d have to have my gf or one of my friends be uncomfortable, but I’m feeling stuck. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to handle it? Am I over thinking?"

Current example; we watch quite a bit of YouTube, and right now pretty much every unskippable ad is for Disney's new Haunted Mansion movie. Now, I initially had no interest in this movie, but if someone asked I'd have been all ""yeah, sure, let's go watch the dumb movie. I like Danny DeVito."". After the last three days on youtube, I specifically will never ever see this movie simply out of spite.

It wouldn't be so bad if there was some variation, but if you make it every ad break and make it unskippable? No, fuck you, you've taken enough of my money simply through what I pay for internet every month, and I didn't even agree to you taking it.


Edit: Apparently I am in the minority where aggressive advertising does not work. I assumed everyone was like me. I was wrong.

I got told I was wrong and selfish for not wanting to date someone with kids. 

I personally don't want kids and feel that eventually, especially if marriage occurs, those kids become part of your life. At some point, you become a parental figure in their life.

Edit: For a little more context, this has happened to me a few times. If you have kids, put that in your dating profile! I was talking to someone and found out through IG that they have kids. They went off on me and said I was selfish and wrong. I have dated with men with kids, even ones who promise there is no drama, there always is. I think it's a huge responsibility to date someone with kids and if it ends up serious, it's a responsibility I don't want!

Edit2: I am a woman. I think people just assume a woman wants kids and I'm selfish for not. So some men with kids think it's selfish of me or there is something wrong with me because I'm supposed to want and be around kids.


Edit3: I asked because it has happened multiple times! I'm like am I the asshole? 🙄🧐

Edit4: I'm 33. I'm pretty firm on this stance of no kids.

I like black pepper just fine and use it plenty, but IMO it belongs in the spice rack with the other spices.

There are definitely plenty of things that should have salt and other seasonings that pepper doesn't quite fit with, but is always lumped in anyway.

In reality this just doesn't seem feasible to me. I'm not saying it's not possible, but sex is pretty much a work-out, so I would imagine if you made it even 1 hour in, your muscles will be sore and starting to cramp, you may feel dehydrated, and not to mention the likelihood of chafing from all that friction, no matter how much lube you use.

I've heard of tantric sex, but that seems to be more focused on massage and slow foreplay than the actual sex itself.

So are people really out there having sex for hours and hours? From a fantasy perspective it sounds exciting, but just like sex on a beach or in a shower, it seems to have way more cons than pros.

**EDIT**

***

So the consensus seems to be that YES you can have sex for hours and hours IF:

* You include lots of foreplay and breaks
* You are on drugs
* You're a lesbian
* You're under 30

So a 21 year old coked out lesbian who enjoys slow-burn could theoretically never stop having sex."

Those people feel like this person is being shy in front of us and needs someone to urge them a bit and then they’ll drink. Sometimes some people think, “Damn, this person never took a sip? I gotta make it my life’s mission today to urge as frequently as I can or at least bring up this matter of the person’s sobriety”

The real reason is that I have a history of being raised in an alcoholic family and have very traumatic childhood memories because of which I vowed to never touch any alcohol or anything that makes you intoxicated.

Of course, I can’t tell this reason since it’ll straight up sour the mood since most of the times I’m an odd one out in social gatherings and everyone becomes curious why I refuse.

So, please help me. Any way I can articulate this so that people don’t ask more than once and get the hint that this person never drank and neither will?


Edit: Sorry, I should have be more specific. Friends and complete strangers usually stop pestering after I decline when I attend parties. But it’s those old people, family friends, relatives who put me in such situations during gatherings and any family events that take place. They get the impression that since we’re close and ""this person is one of ours, everyone here has fun with booze"" we are allowed to have the liberty to urge this person. And my life is filled with people who like to meddle in other people’s lives or hunt for more gossip

Recently I saw a woman on Twitter claim that every woman she knows has nude selfies stored on their phone. As a male in his 20s, I’ve never felt the need to ever take a nude photo of myself, so why is it so common?

Related, why do men send dick pics to women they want to hit on? I hear so many stories from women who are disgusted or irritated by having received them, so why do certain men still send them anyway?

EDIT: Holy shit you guys love talking about what turns you on! This question was sparked by the recent scandal at Rooster Teeth where two people were fired when their nudes were leaked. I know there were other moral and legal factors in play but I couldn’t wrap my mind around why they would take such risky actions that led to the ends of their careers."

On one of these stops, we noticed that behind a row of trees there seemed to be a field. I wanted to check it out so we did. It turned out to be a pond just behind the trees, their shores maybe 10 feet apart but it smelled really gross. 

We started back to our kayaks when I said that it smelled of something dead and rotting. (When I was younger, I’d seen a dead possum floating in water at a golf course, and it smelled just like that).

My girlfriend gave me a weird look and went back to check the smell again and I followed. It again reminded me of that smell only it was much stronger than the possum had been when I was younger and despite us looking, there was no animal near us to be found. 

We turned back to our kayaks and saw what looked like something was dragged in the sand through the spot we’d stood at to look at this smelly pond. We thought it was odd but figured maybe it was a beer cooler. We’d seen some beer cans on the small lakeshore. 

We got back in our kayaks and started to paddle away. We kept close to the shore and discussed what could be making that smell and the drag marks when we heard something in the woods off to our right. It sounded like something was walking through the woods, what I assumed to be either a person or a large dog. I’ve never head a bear before but I suppose it could’ve been that as there are bears in the UP. 

I started towards the noise with my kayak &  told my girlfriend to not follow me toward the shore. The sound stopped as I got closer. After a few minutes of silence, I started paddling back to my girlfriend. 

She told me she thought she heard someone say “stop, they’re right there” coming from the woods. We discussed this for several minutes while kayaking back towards our cabin. My girlfriend then also brought up that she heard voices when we were originally looking at the pond. I told her I too had heard them then but I assumed them to be far away, possibly even across the lake and just traveling over the water. My girlfriend thinks she heard it near the pond, more towards the woods than lake. 

So what we have in all is:
-we saw drag marks with no footprints
-had a smell of something rotting
-heard something/someone walking in the woods 
-may or may not have heard someone talking nearby

Should we do something?


**Edit for update:** We went to the county Sheriff’s Department and told them what we saw/what happened. They said they would send their ORV to check it out. They took our names and number and said they’d contact us if they have any questions. 

To answer some comment questions/replies: We honestly don’t care if they do or don’t do anything about it, we just felt we should maybe report it but weren’t sure. One Redditor said if you’re asking if you should, then do and from now on I’ll follow that. 

We are aware they could all be separate things, and it doesn’t make sense they would be there if the crime happened long enough for it to stink. But regardless, if it’s a hunted animal being dropped, it isn’t hunting season and that’s illegal too. There’s a lot of endangered animals here so I think it’s worth it to report it anyway. 

To the people who think I am making this up, I got all A’s in English throughout college and even received an award for one of my narrative papers. If this was fake it would’ve been better written and you wound my writing skills sir/ma’am. 

Either way, we will not be returning to that area."

I live in a country in Europe and at my school we had to bring our own food to school. You also had different options: You could buy a sandwich at school, you could go outside and go to the store to buy some food or you could go back home to eat and come back when break is over.

Is this just an American thing or do other countries do it too? Why so?

Edit: Thank you all for your answers, I’m glad I now know how it works in different countries :D 

(I also generalised my entire country when I shouldn’t have. I’m only speaking about my own school and other schools I know. I’m sorry, my bad!)

Edit 2: Also how long were your lunch breaks? Mine was 50 min, but in High School it could be as long as 2 hours when we had no class.

Edit 3: There are so many answers and I would like to thank all of you for sharing your stories and answers :) very interesting to read !

Edit 4: I live in Belgium. I grew up in The Netherlands. In middle school (Netherlands), I used to eat home. Most kids would always eat at home.

At my high schoolschool (Belgium), we had two breaks: One 15min break (a snack break) and one 50 min break (but this could be longer).

It was “the norm” for us to bring your own food to school or eat somewhere else (home or at a store). Our school did offer the option to order a sandwich (they didn’t even make it, they would just order it somewhere else). The sandwiches were usually around €3. 

I would only buy one if I forgot my food or didn’t have any time to make it though.

That’s why I’m surprised that other countries actually get (full) lunch at school or even hot meals. My school didn’t do that at all (and other schools I KNEW of, but it’s different all around Belgium!)"

So, sizewise, are we humans closer to the size of a star or to the size of an atom?

&#x200B;

Edit: I know this is a big cliche, but I did not expect this to get so many comments and upvotes. But I'm really glad it did. And I'm really thankful to all of you who dedicated some time to answer me (even with all the calculus involved)!I'd like to point out that some people here are commenting something in the lines of 'the average human is not even 2m tall, and the sun is millions of kilometers wide, of course we are closer to an atom!', and yeah, at first it seems to make sense, but then again, as some kind people pointed out (and that's where my doubt originally came from), atoms are absurdly small. And, yes, although stars are massive, I proposed myself the following mental experiment: if I could increase or decrease the size of a human, at a same proportional and constant rate, would it take longer to a human reach the size of a star or be shrunk to the size of an atom? Of course, here I'm ignoring all physics and biology just for the sake of curiosity about the scale of such big and small things in the universe, and although I love this kind of matter and mental experiments, I'm not so great with math hehehehe! But anyways, thank you all for commenting, and also for the gold! It's my first! :)

Edit 2: Oh, another thing I forgot to mention, but I've seen some people adressed it carefully: There are atoms of different sizes, as there are people and stars of different sizes. In my mind I was just going with the most 'average' measures we could have, like an hydrogem atom, compared to a 1.7m human, and our Sun as our star-sized object in the experiment! Thank you all"

Here’s something for you: my brother (in middle school) is constantly live-streaming to his two or so viewers. As a bonus, he tries to be a soundcloud rapper. 

Just now he let the dog shit in the house (he was supposed to be watching her), pretended his B.B. gun was a glock and shot at some rabbits outside, punched a wall, and is now blasting some rather trash rap. He says today is his 24 hour livestream. 

It’s my one day off this week and I am desperate to read some of my book and do some yoga. How can I end this bullshit? 



Update: I ended up unplugging the WiFi and hiding his charging cable. Turns out he was using WiFi, so this was pretty affective. I made him come with me to the local park, though he screamed like a massive cunt. Brought a ball and we played football.

I’d like to thank everyone for there mostly legal suggestions, can’t say reddit isn’t creative. Especially the people who talked me out of any malicious actions and suggested more kind things I could do. Though I’d like to snip internet cables or have one of you lovely people hack him, I think it’s better to keep his music/videos for later embarrassment. 

Also, since 50% of you suggested whipping my dick out I’d just like it to be known that I’m a girl, and therefore have no massive wang to swing around"

The tracker is at a location in Baltimore city. It is located inside of a restaurant which is a 4 bedroom house. It has a kitchen basement which was shown to me yesterday by a few staff members, and it also has 2 floors above the restaurant. The upstairs has a locked door, and I cant get access to the building without having a key and there is no doorbell. I did do a stakeout yesterday, and picked up on a family coming downstairs to bring groceries up. There were a few kids, and a few adults coming in and out of this space. 

I am kind of at a standstill now. 

The police has no fucks to give, and I don't know how to gain access to the inside of upstairs. It looks like a converted apartment space.

But seriously how tf are you allowed to be overweight and a cop? I don’t think you need to look like John Cena but i definitely think they should be fit and in shape for the safety of everyone. Like some 300 pound dude isn’t gonna be chasing down some criminal and jumping over fences and shit. If our navy and army is required to be fit why would they not require that for the people protecting our communities (Edit: ok so maybe i’m wrong about the last part lmaooo but still) "

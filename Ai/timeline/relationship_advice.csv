Hey everybody, here’s the update. I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn’t post it because it was too soon. 

My husband came home at around 6 o’clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. 

I sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn’t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. 

When he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. 

He told me that the world was in a “shitty place” right now, and that we’re bringing a child into a stressful time. 

He said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. 

He said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he “doubled down” he could get through it. But the more he tried the “darker the tunnel got” and eventually he couldn’t see an end. 

He said that he feels like he’s “constantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.”

He said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn’t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said “this was for when it happens.”

I asked him why he couldn’t tell me any of this, and he said he didn’t want to “burden me with the truth.”

He said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a “protecter and provider”, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. 

Hearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn’t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. 

I asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn’t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It’s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. 

He said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. 

I told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he’d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he’ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. 

Once things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma’s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. 

He also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that’s the plan. I’ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he’s sick and can’t come in, it’s not like they’ll make a sick man come in to work. There’s a pandemic going on :). 

Right now he’s playing with the kids and it doesn’t feel like he’s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.

For the first time in months I don’t see the robot, I see my husband.

Edit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. 

I didn’t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. 

First things first, my husband says hi. 

1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it’s my responsibility. My husband’s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other “house maintenance” stuff. 

2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn’t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. 

3. The pregnancy wasn’t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a “if it happens it happens” kind of thing. We’re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. 

4. We realize that a one week vacation isn’t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we’re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that’s, “daddy’s time.” No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax. 

5. To those of you who think this fake; there isn’t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I’m not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys. 

You all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldn’t have been possible without you guys. 

I’m not going to reply to comments because, like last time, it’s an overwhelming amount. But just know I’m reading these as they come in. 

Goodnight everyone, it’s been great."

Hey guys! Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a ""story"". But I understand, haha.

I just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.

I also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like ""she's cheating, it's over"" and ""don't even confront her, just leave"". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work. 

And thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.

**ON TO THE UPDATE.**

I decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest. 

I basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?

She immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy). 

So, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN! 

Needless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha. Thanks for reading!! 

TLDR: snake

Edit #2: did you guys really award me 130 snek awards... I love reddit"

Hello, lovely people. As promised I am back with an update for you on all what happened the other day. [Here it is, if you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Want to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) 

Okay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. ""Friend"" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face ""Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?"" 

Well, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said ""oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird"". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. 

Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!"

Also thanks for all the gold and silver, it's appreciated although if you wanna spend money give it to charity or something.

I went and talked to him this morning I told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. He was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. I was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. I told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so I ended it and left him. I am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. Thanks everyone :)"
hxuhig,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat.

**TL;DR** My gf is a passionate vegan and wants me to get rid of my beloved cat because cats eat meat and kill mice.

First of all, let me say thank you for everyone who offered advice. There are over 7,000 comments on my original post and I have dozens of PMs. Frankly I'm still pretty overwhelmed with the magnitude of the response. I did my best to read most everyone's comments but obviously I couldn't get to everything!

I would also like to preempt this post by saying, as many users pointed out, that my GFs extreme views on domestic cats are not representative of the vegan/vegetarian community as a whole. I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.

So, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.

I called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. 

So, yeah. That's really it.

Oh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:

Thanks again to everyone who offered advice. It really helped."

Twice. I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know. 

Next morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit. 

But she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way. 

So how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?


EDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much! 

To clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here. 

Secondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it. 

For those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now. 

And to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you. 

And for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b


Again, thank you so much for your kind comments. Y'all are amazeballs."
gxh3g6,Update: My [36M] wife [34F] keeps tying my boots after I've told her to keep her hands off of them.

I've gotten a few requests for update but didn't want to post until I felt like I really had anything to say. A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.

My wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.

I responded, ""But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it.""

A few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.

He then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, ""This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out."" ""Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck."" ""Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life.""

After that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.

I told her, ""I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it.""

She acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.

After I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.

She's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, ""I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do."" Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.

Is everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.

tl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since."

There was a few idiots telling me I needed to be Alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn’t a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

Thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

Hi! Since my last post I spoke to my grandparents and told them everything. I asked if I could stay with them if I wanted to and they agreed. I then spoke to my dad again and tried to tell him how I felt and what I had heard. I didn't want to film or record because I knew that he would be mad at that and wouldn't listen. He didn't believe me again and thought that I was jealous of having to share him with someone else. I got upset and told him that I was leaving so he could live happily ever after without the burden of having me around. He looked shocked but didn't say anything. 

I had already packed my bags and had brought some things to my grandparents house already. My dad didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My grandfather picked me up and I've been there since. I haven't gone home and I haven't heard from my dad. My grandparents told me that they would handle my dad and that I shouldn't have to be the one doing it. 

I'm upset that my dad hasn't called or texted me once to see if I'm ok. At the same time I'm feeling so much better being with my grandparents. My grandmother is probably the sweetest person ever and my grandfather is a little rough around the edges but he's really a softie."
czhvrp,I (M28) broke up with my ex-fiancée (F27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. I am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.,68665,0.91,9043,2019-09-04 13:35:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czhvrp/i_m28_broke_up_with_my_exfiancée_f27_of_4_years_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czhvrp/i_m28_broke_up_with_my_exfiancée_f27_of_4_years_2/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,,False,"Hey guys,

I need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

A little background: 

Me and my ex-fiancée had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. I didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

Imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

Heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

Everything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""Sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fiancée at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

When i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

She cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

I told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

I did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancée had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

I am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancée friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

I am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do."

Update 2:

Sorry for not updating, my grandpa passed away yesterday morning.

Nothing happened to me, but my situation is a secondary concern right now. Regardless, I think I will be alright, thanks to your amazing support and help.

My sister is aware of everything, and told me not to worry, she has my back and I have her support.

I promise to update when and if there are any significant changes, right now I need to support my grandma.

Thank you again to everyone.

Update:

Sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

Managed to talk with my mom yesterday, but I chickened out half way through what I had to say :(

The good news is that I am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

Thank you for all your support, everyone, I will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

My grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

I will let you know how I manage.

Thank you again.

Pretty much the title. I have no idea how to process all this, and I am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

Both my older brother and sister went to the same college. My brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. Both had their college paid by our dad. Dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

My brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

My sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

I got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. I always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

Instead I was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how I am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

Dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. He said it was never is place to say anything since I am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

Apparently my grandparents know I am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

My siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as I am because there was never a hint of anything being off. I might be naive, but I always thought I had a great relationship with my dad. We go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when I had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. I never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. I mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. It's a story he tells from time to time. He likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

My mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

I feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. I am not even sure I will be able to go to college any more, I always assumed my parents will pay for it. I never had a job, and I am not sure what job I can even get to support me through college, I have no idea how to apply for loans.

All my mom has done is cry and apologize. But nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

I don't even know if I am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, I feel shame leaving my room, and if I will be asked to move out I don't know where to go. I don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

I am angry at my mom, I am confused about where I stand with my dad. There's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. I feel rejected and I have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

Anyone have any idea what to do here?

Do I apologize to my dad? What do I say to him?

Idk, I've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. I have no idea what to do.

Edit: Comments are coming in faster than I can reply, but I am making a list with all the advice about financial aid, health insurance, getting my own phone plan, etc, things I didn't even think about before. Thank you everyone.

I will try to answer as much as I can, but there's more comments than I can handle."
h9wv4x,[UPDATE] You were right. I ignored every single one of your comments and eventually caught my wife with the other man,61973,0.95,3201,2020-06-16 10:18:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h9wv4x/update_you_were_right_i_ignored_every_single_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h9wv4x/update_you_were_right_i_ignored_every_single_one/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This is a tough pill to swallow, and I can't say I hadn't been warned. [This is my previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said) Many folks asked me to follow up with an update so here it is, fresh from the oven.

After reading every single comment of the reddit post, my brain just couldn't overcome the catastrophe and the collapse of the world I had built for me in which my wife is my love, my best friend and partner, as well a the person I admire the most. She was entirely perfect, and made me happy for many years. I thought no couple in the world could have what we had. We were both very happy for a long time. We were both attractive, we were both inherently good, had big hearts and were individually wildly successful in our careers.

After the reddit post, I moved to an airbnb and eventually with family to think things through. It was a terrible time but a psychologist helped me recover from a terrible mental state. It coincided with the pandemic hitting very hard in my city (I caught the virus), which didn't help.

During this time, we kept talking and my wife was very sorry and continued saying they hadn't met. I knew it wasn't true but was willing to forgive the woman of my dreams, who continued being in the highest altar of my universe.

Fast forward last saturday morning, I went back to our place, ready to forgive her and talk things through in the most mature way possible. And well, there she was, but I was the one who received the biggest surprise, to say the least. The guy was in my house naked, and so was my wife. The guy from the messages, the guy from the pics. The one she said she didn't even like. I caught him hiding in my bathroom as my wife was putting her pajamas on. When I saw him hiding in my bathroom, he uttered ""sorry dude"". For a second I asked myself, is this were I kill him? But I instantly replied ""I got nothing against you"", because the guy was just nailing this hot woman. Even if he was doing so in a house full of pictures of me. Pictures of our wedding and our families. Pictures of my dead father who would be so sad to see how the marriage he never witnessed was going to end. He has always been the reason I try to make the world a better place. He passed away two months before our wedding.

I'm sorry. I still love her to death. But I understand enough is enough. Even if my world collapses, I hope I can build a new one without lies and in which I'm not just a blind believer under an altar of a fake god.

Godspeed."

Hi all. First off, I want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or PM. I am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support I received and I spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as I read your messages and well wishes.

The night after I wrote my original post, I wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/Witchy_Woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Dear \[Wife’s name\],

I love you more than you can imagine and the most I want in this world is for you to be happy. I understand that as a man I probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. I’m doing my best to help you but the fact that you won’t help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. I honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don’t make an effort to get better. However, I want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. I’m ready to talk whenever you are.

With all my love,

\[My name\]”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. The next morning (March 16th), I woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed OJ. When I walked into the bedroom with her food, I saw her reading my letter. When she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. Full on, Niagara Falls level crying. I hugged her tighter, told her “I love you so, so, much”, and started crying too. I honestly don’t know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. It could’ve been 10 minutes, it could’ve been an hour, I didn’t care. When she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. Reddit, you guys don’t know how thrilled and proud I was when I heard those words. She then asked me if we could go on a trip to Japan because in her words “I really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.”

I was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. She’s always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels I saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. We just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. We have a 5AM Uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

We’re not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

EDIT: I'm going to bed. Thank you to everyone who followed my story and offered their well wishes."
fv7ec7,"My son and his ""friend"" are a couple. How do I let them know it's okay?",61524,0.92,3130,2020-04-05 09:21:41,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fv7ec7/my_son_and_his_friend_are_a_couple_how_do_i_let/,self.relationship_advice,0,10,,text,False,False,False,"Hello Reddit. Please bear with me regarding my formatting and things. I have read the rules and things, but I'm an old fart who is rather on the wrong side of 40 so I'm not overly well versed in the art of efficient internetting. 

My boy is 20 years old. He's absolutely my pride and joy, and there is nothing he could do that would ever make me love him less. For the first half of his life, I regrettably wasn't involved very much. His mother and I parted ways when he was just a few months old and at the time I was struggling with a heroin addiction and was absolutely not as present in his life as I should have been, nor was I suited to fatherhood at all. I saw him, at most, two to three times a year for the first 12 years of his life. I won't discuss details because that's his private story to tell, but when he was 12 he revealed to me that he was being badly mistreated at the hands of his mother and her boyfriend. Despite not being the best father at the time, I didn't want my boy suffering any more so I got myself cleaned up and sorted out in order to get full custody of him. I've effectively been a single (and sober!) father ever since and he has little to no contact with his mother. He's everything a man could want his son to be; he's uniquely kind and fiercely loyal, he's unflinchingly brave, he's incredibly generous and, despite the horrors he suffered as a child, he's unfailingly positive and sunny to the last. Somehow I of all people was bestowed with the honour of watching him grow from a sweet young boy to the greatest man I have ever known. I cannot stress enough my pride in him.

When he was 18, he got accepted into a top ranking university on the other side of the country. I was sad to see him go, but simultaneously overjoyed that he got into his first choice and was starting a new chapter in his life. He comes home once every other month, and on the month's he doesn't come home, I go to visit him. He's doing well in uni, has made lots of friends and seems incredibly happy there, which I'm obviously chuffed about. Since his second year, he's lived with his ""friend"" in a flat off-campus. I've strongly suspected since his early teens that my son is gay, and I now more or less have confirmation that this is true and that his ""friend"" is actually his boyfriend. 

So, for this COVID-19 faff, my son decided he'd rather come home and quarantine at mine than stay at his uni flat. His ""friend"", however, would be left alone if my son came back as he's a Candian and his family are back over there, and I gather he doesn't have the best relationship with them anyway. He asked if it would be okay if ""friend"" tagged along to my house and I said of course, no problem. 

They've been back at mine for about six weeks now. They think they're being subtle I know, but I've caught them doing coupley things on several occasions now. The ""friend"" has slipped up a couple of times and called my son 'babe' and 'sweetie' in front of me, which I pretended not to notice for the sake of saving embarrassment. There have been nights where we'll be watching a film with the lights off and, thinking I can't see, my son will have his arm around the ""friend"". One day I walked into the lounge and I'm positive they'd just been kissing and were trying to cover it, though I admit I have no confirmation on that one. The most solid evidence, however, came a few mornings ago. I get up very early to go for runs in the morning (hence why I'm making a reddit post at five in the morning haha). As far as I was told, my son was sleeping in his childhood room and his ""friend"" was in the guest room. I don't know what possessed me to do so, but on Tuesday morning I cracked my son's door open to check on him like I used to when he was a kid. Lo and behold, they're both asleep, snuggled up together, in my son's bed. That's more or less solidified for me that they're together. I didn't say anything, just shut the door and went for my run, and I haven't mentioned it to them yet. 

What I want advice on is this; how do I let my son and his boyfriend know that I'm okay with them being a couple and they don't have to feel like they have to sneak around in my house? I want them to be comfortable here and I want them to know I support them both no matter what. Or is that not a good idea? Am I better off leaving it alone and waiting until they tell me themselves, if they ever do? I obviously don't want to force either of them out of the closet, but at the same time I hate feeling as if they feel like they're being forced *into* the closet in my house. What's my best course of action here?? 

TL:DR - my son and his ""friend"" are staying with me for quarantine. It's abundantly clear they're a couple, and I want to let them know it's okay and they don't have to sneak around in my house. What's the best way to go about it?"

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he’s taking it so well and he told me he’s experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn’t allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he “got his head straight”. 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn’t give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they’d be in love with him. 

Well I think it’s working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn’t start eating until he arrived. 

I’m just so incredibly happy that I get to keep both relationships."

Tl;dr: Turns out you all were right, I was an asshole. My friends are no longer welcomed in our house and now I'm playing with my gf.

I've decided to post this update becauce you were all right. I didn't have a gf problem. I had friends problem.

So I had a talk with my gf like one of the users have suggested. I explained to her that I'm not ashamed of her hobby, I just didn't want her to know what our friends were saying behind her back. She said she doesn't care about their opinion, she's just doing what she's enjoying the most. I apologized to her. She has also agreed to move her pokemon plushies so they wouldn't take up so much space.

Fast forward to today, few hours ago our friends have visited us. It didn't take long for them to start making fun of my gf. This time I got mad - she organized her plushies so they were all in our bedroom, she has not even once mentioned pokemons nor did she opened pokemon go app. 

Long story short they were forced to leave. I've realized they don't have problem with my gf hobby - they have problem with my gf and I have enabled their behaviour by not reacting sooner. Told them they are the ones who needs to grow up & to visit us again once they will stop being boomers.

hyx61u,UPDATE:My girlfriends father discouraged me from proposing because their family isn’t thrilled about us having “Dark Babies”,54774,0.91,1067,2020-07-27 23:23:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hyx61u/updatemy_girlfriends_father_discouraged_me_from/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hyx61u/updatemy_girlfriends_father_discouraged_me_from/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx9boq/my29m_girlfriends27f_dad_discouraged_me_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Thanks for all y’all’s input it really helped and most of y’all were right on the target.

Yesterday afternoon I sat my gf, Naomi down and had a conversation with her about what her dad said to me. I tried to leave out any mention of proposal and told her I was in their neighborhood and decided to pop by (Terrible lie, I know but she bought it). I told her what her dad said about us having dark babies and asked if she had any similar feelings about our kids popping out half black. She looked at me like I was out of my mind. She told me she didn’t give a fuck about the color of her kids as long as I was the dad, which was reassuring. She was not so happy with her dad. She wanted us to take a drive over there and talk with her parents about it. 

That evening we dropped by unannounced and when her mom opened the door to see us she immediately asked Naomi to show her the ring. Naomi was confused and I about shit myself. I, like a dumbass, didn’t call ahead to her parents that I hadn’t proposed. I guess her mom thought we were going to surprise her with the engagement and assumed I had already proposed. I was speechless. They began speaking in Korean, but from context I assume her mom was asking if I was too cheap to buy her an engagement ring. And Naomi looked at me and started hugging and kissing me. My secret was out and I told her I had already asked her parent for their blessing. She was a few seconds from crying but sucked it up so we could speak to her dad. 

Like I said in my og post my future father in law isn’t great at English so he and Naomi spoke in Korean. According to Naomi, she asked him why he told me that, and he said that he was worried about their extended family not viewing our babies as Korean and being rude to them or me for being black. I guess this did not come across well in English, because he was just concerned for me and our kids. He didn’t care that our babies would have dark skin. This was a huge relief. Her father isn’t the racist their extended families are (but like, fuck them who cares what they think). I am just so glad that our future kids are going to have grandparents that are going to love them. Only downside is now Naomi is expecting my proposal so I really got to knock her socks off.

Thanks so much for all the help.🤟🏿"

[^((Original Post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life."

Well it turns out she had had a lecture today at college (she studies psychology) and the topic was on peadophiles. Apparently one of the talking points was that pedophiles are attracted to the lack of body hair. 

When she told me this, I asked her ""are you seriously calling me a pedophile because I find completely shaven attractive?! Can I just point out that you're 21 and not 12?"" She basically skirted around my questions and then stormed out of my apartment when I kept pressing her on it. As she left she called me revolting and is now ignoring my calls and text messages. 

What. The. Fuck.

Honestly not even sure where to go from here. We've never had any issues and was planning on proposing in the next year. Where has this even come from?! 

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend pretty much called me a pedo because I told her I liked shaved pussy when she asked me my preference."

Thank you for all the advice. I ended up bringing it up yesterday and it instantly turned into an argument again. He asked me why I’m defending ‘thots’ so much yet again. Asking me why I cared so much about what he thought about woman who sleep around. He then went on to say I should of known better than to sleep with so much guys and that I ‘knew what I was doing’. He said I was straight up a thot in my past but he loves me and is willing to look past it. Yeah no. I stood my ground and said I can’t be with anyone who sees woman like that and that I wasn’t going to let him talk to me like that. I broke things off and he called me stupid for thinking he would let me break up with him and that turned into a whole new argument about how I ain’t ‘loyal’ and I ain’t no ‘ride or die’ chick. I also blocked him on all my socials and he is still making accounts to contact me on. Definitely made the right decision to end things. 

Also to the people who messaged me saying he was right and that I deserved to be dumped. That nobody likes a used up chick, and many other unkind words, it was so unnecessary and I hope you step on a lego.

We have generally had a good relationship and a good marriage.

We had a reasonably expensive wedding, which we're still paying for now. I get the bill every month to prove it. My wife took charge of planning the wedding, so it was to her tastes. She seemed to enjoy it at the time and for the first few years of our marriage, she would look back at the wedding with me happily and without issues.

In recent months I've noticed my wife's attitude to a) our wedding and b) our marriage itself shift. It began by her (I thought jokingly) referring to herself as my 'girlfriend'. She told me to buy her a 'girlfriend' card for Valentine's Day rather than a 'wife' one, for example. 

I thought she was just playing around at first. But this behaviour has only escalated. Two months ago my wife stopped wearing her wedding ring. I was understandably upset and asked her if there was something wrong. She told me everything was fine and she just 'doesn't the sensation of jewellery on her hands'. My wife has never liked rings and jewellery so this could be the case.

But when we are with friends, my wife will get upset if I talk about her as 'my wife' rather than just a girlfriend. She will go as far to interrupt me if I'm talking/telling a story to 'correct' me on our relationship. Initially, this was something our friends laughed at, but now everybody just finds it understandably awkward.

One of our friends was talking about their own wedding, which is scheduled for early next year. They asked for advice from my wife about how she'd planned ours and my wife responded with 'what wedding?'. When our friend continued talking about the table decorations my wife had used, my wife visibly teared up in front of the whole group and had to step outside.

Later that evening, I asked her directly if she has a problem with our relationship or if I'm doing something wrong in our marriage. She assured me that everything is fine between us. From my perspective, outside of this issue, our relationship is as strong as ever. We are considering kids in the near future, our sex life is great, and my wife recently suggested we get matching tattoos as a renewal of our love.

Is there advice anyone can offer on why my wife might be acting like this and what I should do?"

We're both white, so she was forced to admit that the child was a result of a one night stand last year. 

I've started divorce proceedings, although we're still living together for now. Between our two boys(aged 2 and 4, I've had paternity tests for them and they came back positive), her infant daughter and her having lost her job due to COVID, living together as amicably as possible until the divorce is settled is an unfortunate necessity.

Naturally I have no ill will towards the baby, and I've been disgusted by some of the comments I've heard from family members, friends, coworkers and others, all who seem to be fixated on the racial angle of this. As if the most salient part of this isn't that my wife cheated, but that she cheated with a BLACK man and that the baby is BLACK.

What really worries me is that my two sons might pick up on these narratives. They're too young to really understand what's happening now, but I'm worried that as they grow to understand the situation that they might grow to resent their half-sister for ""breaking up their parents marriage"". And worse that their resentment might express itself in a racist fashion, under the influence of the aforementioned racist narratives.

Any thoughts on how I should try to influence my son's away from that perspective? It probably doesn't help that we live in a suburb with very few black people and their half-sister is really the only black person my children know."

All of the following happened yesterday so excuse me if I ramble a bit , it's all fresh in
 my mind. 

ORIGINAL POST
--------------------------
Mandatory:  I have been with my gf Sarah for 3 years and been living together for 1.5. She is honestly everything I have ever wanted and I planning on proposing somewhere next year.

So 3 weeks ago I was out with Sarah at a local bar drinking and having a great time with her as it was just after quarantine had ended where I live. At around 3 am we decided to head home. As we headed to the parking lot where we had parked we noticed a group of 2 girls and a guy who was clearly drunk trying to hit on them and get them to go to his house. The girls were clearly very uncomfortable and trying to find a way out. Sarah told me that we had to do something and I told her go call the cops and get someone as well because the very leat I wanted was her to get hurt during this.

So I approached the group and try to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the two girls and long story short I got my ass kicked. The guy was at least 6ft4 and 220 lbs where as I'm 5ft11 167lbs . I'm fairly mascular myself but there was no way I could have taken someone that big, I knew it from the start. At least from all the noise we had made a lot of people rushed the scene and the girls got away safe. I was rushed to the ER because the motherfucker had broken my ribs which had punctured my right lung. Yay.

After that incident Sarah has grown a distant from me. Even though she visited and stayed with me at the hospital she hasn't been the same since. And I thought she just needed time to move past this. However 5 days ago she told me that she is not the same person after what happened and she doesn't know if she feels safe with me after I got beat up like that. Honestly hearing that hurt me more than when I got my ribs broke. She has  moved to her parents for the time being and she told me she needs time. Meanwhile I had no one here to help me so my brother left his 2 boys and wife to move in with me. I know I'm just venting at this point but I don't want this to be over like that. Reddit is there anything I can do to salvage the situation?

UPDATE:
_______________

Until yesterday it had been 14 days since my last contact with Sarah. My brother had left 4 days prior because I felt bad keeping him away from his family for so long, plus I could take care of myself to some extent. So around 2 pm while I was making lunch I hear the doorbell ring. I go to open the door and there she is. Sarah. With tears in her eyes, eye bags, frizzy hair,looking like a total mess. During the time we've been together I've seen her in her ups downs but I'd never seen her in such horrible  state before. So I let her in she sits on the couch , we haven't still said a word as we were both dumbfounded. I was so overwhelmed by emotions, I wanted to hug her, I wanted to full on blast on her, I didn't even know what I wanted to do. So I did nothing and waited for her to talk.

 After 5 or 10 minutes of silence she starts sobbing and saying she's sorry and, then full on crying. At this point I can barely hold myself together. So I hold her hand and  try to calm her down so I can figure out what is going on. After a while she finally somewhat calms down and starts talking. And that's where it got bad. 

Something that I didn't include in the original post, because it wouldn't make sense to anyway is that Sarah's mother has been divorced and remarried once. From what Sarah has told me, her biological father cheated on her mother while she was still a kid and that's why they broke up. And that's also why she doesn't have any kind of relationship with her father. It seemed odd when I first learned about it, but I didn't question it. That is not the whole story though. 

Sarah's biological father didn't only cheat on her mother. He was a drug addict pos, that also used to beat her up frequently. Without getting into a lot of graphic detail  in one instance when Sarah's brother tried to intervene and protect her mother he ended up getting beat up too. So when she saw me intervening and getting my ass kicked in the bar incident it triggered some kind of PTSD in her head that she could not control . That's why she had grown distant and eventually left. It all spiraled out of control and she could not handle it.

In those two weeks we'd been apart she'd barely eaten or slept and even made some really dark thoughts which I'd rather not go into. She told me is a horrible girlfriend for  leaving me alone in my condition and that she doesn't  expect us to be together again after that,which I told her  isn't the case.

So we have a very long road ahead of us. My number one  priority right is getting her to see a therapist, which I suggested we can do together if she's scared to do alone.


So yeah that's where we are at. Some of you were right, that there was some deeper issue behind what happened but I could not have possibly known.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to say something that I got messaged about a lot. I got a lot of comments and messages saying that I was a moron for what I did at that parking lot and that I should mind my own buisness next time and not play the hero, etc . First of all I did not initiate the fight with the dude. As I said when I got there  I tried to pretend I was the boyfriend of the one of the girls in case. When that didn't work I got between the girls and the dude trying to create some space between them and that's when he started to push me and eventually  started throwing punches.

Secondly no matter how hard I hit the gym I would never be able to take that guy one on one. As I said I'm pretty fit, and  I've been working out for several years but the fella was a lot bigger than me. Unless I had a gun or something, which isn't legal in my country I was doomed.

Finally  for the people telling me to mind my own business, well let me you that what exactly what I was doing. It is mine and everyone else's responsibility to look after the ones who can't protect themselves is this shitty world. No, I do not consider myself a hero, nor did I do it for the show. I did it because in some other instance one of those girls could have been my girlfriend, sister, mother needing help. And these girls  were somebody else's girlfriend, sister or mother .  If I was put in that situation a hundred more times I would  act the same.

Edit:I also talked to her about the proposal I wanted to make this year. I was planning on doing it as a surprise but in the way the things have turned out I figured it would be better if she knows it first. We both agreed it should be delayed for now."

Hey people, it's been a while since my original post and I have some free time today and not much to do with it so I'm gonna write this, why not.

A lot happened since my first post, in the end, my GF, now ex I guess, couldn't deal with the fact that I had a new priority. I admit that I wasn't the best at managing time between them two and I would spend a lot more with my sister than my GF but I think that's understandable, maybe. In general, my GF was on and off with my sister, one day she would be the nicest person to her and the other would completely blow her off and be borderline mean. I had a few talks with her that it needs to stop, but it would only end up working for maybe the rest of the week and the next it would be back to square one. About three weeks ago it erupted into a big argument, she accused me of not loving her anymore, and that I play favorites. I told her they're not my children to be playing favorites and that obviously for some time my sister is gonna need a lot more attention, since you know she lost her parents. In the end, she went back to her ultimatum, sister or her. I was angry at this point, because she has been mean to my sister that day, and I told her she can pack her shit and find a place to sleep tonight. I haven't seen her since and quite frankly I don't really want to. We texted for a bit, basically both sides confirming its over and arranging when she can come for the rest of her stuff.

As for my sister, she's a lot better. She doesn't stay in her room all day anymore and she's slowly going back to her talkative old self. She still doesn't like being alone but it was the same before the accident, so since my gf moved out, we've been sharing a bed for comfort. She still wakes up at night crying sometimes so it's better when I'm there and frankly it's a lot more comfortable. One thing I really regret is my sister heard that whole fight and she started apologizing to me for breaking me and my GF up, I ensured her it's not her fault at all and if anything she helped me see for who my GF really was. She still goes to her therapist and it's really helped a ton, she doesn't need me to be there while she falls asleep and doesn't panic when I go to the shop for 15 minutes.

All in all, these past 3 months have been the hardest time in my life but eye opening to my ex's disregard for my family and kind of me too. Sorry for no happy ending, I guess this is how real life is.

EDIT2: I would love to thank everybody for kind words individually but with this amount it's crazy, so I wanna give everyone who gave me advice and kind words a HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY YOU'RE ALL AMAZING. These numbers are overwhelming and I can't even express in words how it feels that so many people care, it's really something else. Didn't expect that strangers on the internet could make me cry either, so once again a huge THANK YOU."

God this is a doozy. I swear my life feels like a movie right now. Sorry for the weird formatting, I'm on mobile and this is my first time posting on a sub like this. 

I (28M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend of 3 years (26F). Now, I suck at picking out jewelry. Im the type of guy that doesn't see a problem with heart shaped jewelry (seriously why is it considered so ugly?) so every time I want to buy something for my girl, I usually consult one of our mutual friends. My girl's best friends are all friends with me as well and we all get along well, so asking them for help picking out jewelry is something I'm used to. 

When it came time to pick out a ring, I consulted my girlfriends best friend Justine (fake name). Justine and I are quite close and she knows my girlfriend better than anyone, including me. So, when my girlfriend when out to visit her sister and baby nephew, I invited Justine over to the house to help pick out a ring.

Justine and I looked through a few catalogues, but decided it was a dead end and it would be better to go to professionals at a jewelry store. However, I didn't know when my girlfriend would be coming home, so Justine and I thought of a clever text to gauge how much time we had. I asked her when she'd be coming home, as I was ordering takeout and wanted to know when to tell them to have the food ready by. 

She responded by saying it would be a few hours, she met up with Justine to go shopping. Now, obviously this took me by surprise since Justine was standing inside my house. I showed Justine the text, and she looked as confused as I was. 

It isn't out of the ordinary for my girlfriend to meet up with people out of the blue like that for shopping, lunch, etc. She's a very spontaneous person and loves making plans on the fly. So ordinarily, I would have believed this text in a heartbeat. However, obviously this had to be a lie. 

When she came home she acted completely normal, and I played along but it's been really hard to act like everything's fine. We got takeout, ate together, and cuddled on the couch after. So far she's caught on a little that somethings upsetting me, but I just can't tell her what. Looking at her kills me. 

I don't know what to do. My girlfriend and I have zero trust issues and we tell each other everything, so this lie is killing me. I want to ask her about it so bad, but if I tell her I knew she was lying, I'd have to explain why, and I really don't want to do that. What do I do? I know she lied to me but I don't know how to confront her about it. Should I just forget it? This won't stop gnawing at me. Please help!

Edit: I'm sorry for the lack of responses, it's been a hectic day and there's a lot of comments. Thank you to everyone who has commented so far, I appreciate them all!!

Edit #2: sorry again for the lack of responses, guys. It's really been a crazy day. My parents are moving and I've been helping them. Also, I've never experienced this many comments on a post in my life!! I am going to talk to her tonight once we're both finally settled in after such a busy day, and I will update tomorrow."

We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

What the frick frack do I do. I am currently at my friends house and I might stay here for the night. tomorrow would be our last day as an unmarried couple and I am straight up panicking."

Before I get into anything, I am safe, and I am okay and recovering.

Thank you to everyone that commented and reached out to me. Your advice and words of wisdom meant so much to me. Well, everyone but the guy that messaged me to tell me that ""guys won't like me"" if I tell them why I broke up with my now ex-boyfriend.

I can't go into a lot of details, but the clinic I went to sent me to the hospital, where I had a full work up done, and met with a DV advocate and police officers. The scale of injuries were severe enough that I was granted an immediate order of protection.

This was the [last text message](https://imgur.com/a/yaI8A7X) I got from him before I changed my number. I have a feeling that many posters were correct, that this was the test to see how far he could go.

All of my big things are in storage at my parent's house, and I've been rotating between a couple different friend's houses the past couple of nights. I have plans to move a couple cities over, so I will be as far away from him as possible. My advocate set up an appointment with a therapist, and I met with her this morning.

I'm not sleeping much still, but I am surrounded by good people that will help me get through this.

Thank you reddit. The clarity you all gave me probably saved my life."

Although I didn't get to reply to any of the comments except for one, I made sure to read all of them in my main account, so I would like to thank everyone for their great advices. Here I am now, excited to tell what happened in the course of 5 days.

So the day after posting that, nothing really happened. I spent that day reflecting on what kind of future I see and want with her. I also thought a lot about the past; how we messed it up, how we both got too lost in our jobs... etc. In my original post, I asked if what I'm feeling could be just an infatuation that would go as quickly as I came. But I realized that my feelings for her never really disappeared to begin with. It's like my heart just went in a deep sleep and I forgot how much feelings I carry for her.

I think some of you may know (and have pointed out) that I'm not really good at communicating my feelings. I tend to keep things to myself, and my fiancé is one of the few people who can be patient with that. Some suggested to write a letter instead, or a note, or marry her in sims... I ended up with drafts of sappy letters that I ended up scraping and a sad attempt to recreate us in the sims. But still, I wanted to make an effort to show her what I couldn't say through words. 

I've heard about her wanting a few DLCs in the sims in the past, so I had the idea to buy a few for her (sims' DLCs are pretty expensive especially in our currency..). Surprised her by stealing her laptop for a few hours and once I gave it back to her, she was elated and so happy. It was really nice seeing her get so excited over it. We played together that whole day and tried to solve the mystery in Strangerville (a game pack in the sims). It was so fun.

The next day, I found her in the kitchen trying to bake something. It was a blueberry cheesecake recipe she saw on youtube. I basically became her cooking assistant that day, helping her as much as I could and we ended up with a pretty decent outcome that I bet would've tasted better if I hadn't messed up so much. She still said she had so much fun and loved the cheesecake though.

The next day, which is just yesterday, something important happened. We were basically just snuggled up on the couch playing when our sims just autonomously ""tried for baby"" in the bed. It was hilarious and we initially laughed about it but then we got pretty silent. She then closed her laptop and hugged me tightly then, without saying anything. I think that was my realization that ""oh, she feels the same as I do.."" so I knew I had to speak up. I'm still impressed at myself for managing to talk yesterday without choking up, basically opening up the conversation like ""are you planning to go to your parents soon?"" and she said no, she doesn't feel like it yet. I asked her why, she told me she wanted to stay. I told her I wanted her to stay too. We went to sleep that night just huddled together. And even though we didn't really explicitly say it, I think we're now aware of each other's feelings and it feels like a really huge improvement to me.

Earlier we ate breakfast together. We weren't as chatty as we've been the last few months but the silence was comforting. We also watched ""Knives Out"" together. We haven't had \*the\* conversation yet, but I'm going to bring it up to her tonight. I'm really glad this whole ordeal went much nicer than I expected it would and I'm relieved I didn't let my doubts get the best of me. Though I still have to get better with how I communicate things, I'm going to learn for her. 

Thank you to everyone who left nice comments in my original post. I apologize again if there are any mistakes in my post, I'm not a native english speaker nor am I from the USA. 

TL;DR: We both feel the same towards each other. We're yet to have the ""talk"" but I know now, without a doubt, that she still loves me, too.

Original Post is Here: [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g86svn/i_accidentally_found_out_my_28m_fiancee_27f_has/)

She came back after i sent a large apology message, apologizing for laughing at her fan fiction and it was not done out of malice and more out of awkwardness.

We had a long talk about it, i explained i wasn't that comfortable with her keeping such a large amount of her life secret/hidden from me. She also admitted that often times when she was saying she was working late in our home office what she actually meant was she was writing/drawing stuff and just wanted to be left alone.

I told her i had no problem with her hobbies, which made her happy. She also told me that she is so embarrassed because a bunch of it is self inserts of her, and some of it would make me unhappy reading it. 

I asked her to show me, and she eventually agreed. I read some of it and it didn't bother me at all, (imo to me fantasizing about fictional characters isn't a huge deal as it is simply a fantasy and not real).    I asked if some of the things she writes are things that turns her on, and i told her i am willing to try anything at least once. 

Yesterday night she actually sat down next to me, and started writing while i was next to her on the couch, and she didn't seem embarrassed at all anymore. So i guess this is good.

Thank you for your help.

TL;DR; Me and my Fiancee were able to work things out, and she isn't so embarassed anymore about it, and is willing to share with me. Thanks for the advice!"

I used to be in this controlling, kind of abusive relationship. When I finally broke it off a year ago, my ex started showing up places, trying to get me to take him back. Eventually, it developed into full-on stalking. He would show up at my work (and took to just waiting outside of it after he was banned), leave notes on my car when I was at the grocery store, leave all kinds of flowers outside my house and then stick angry notes on my door after he saw me throw them in the trash, wrote me all kinds of weird, obsessive emails and letters. I’ve had to change my phone number three times. The behavior escalated over time, and got scarier/more threatening. In one instance, he started a small fire in my driveway but the police couldn’t get enough evidence connecting him to it. It was after that instance that I put cameras in my yard (I previously only had them pointing at my doors).

I was horrified to learn that the police couldn’t do shit about any of this until my stalker actually was caught doing something illegal, like breaking into my house. At which point, I might already be dead. I decided I wasn’t spending the rest of my life waiting for the other shoe to drop, so I got a handgun and a concealed carry permit, took some self defense courses, and started doing strength training. I also looked into getting an attack dog, but after all the money I’d sunk into my other methods of protection, they were prohibitively expensive. So I went to my local animal shelter and got the scariest, meanest-looking dog I could find. This is where Thor comes in. He’s a 100 pound American Bulldog, looks like he’d rip your throat out on sight, but is basically a gigantic teddy bear. He loves every person he’s ever met, is incredibly sweet and gentle with my 4-year-old niece, enjoys other animals, and even loves the mailman. I just kind of accepted that he probably wouldn’t do anything to protect me from my stalker, but it didn’t matter that much because having such a huge dog made me so much more confident. I brought Thor everywhere I could, and was working on getting him trained enough to be an emotional support animal, so I could bring him inside places with me (I absolutely would not do this until he was trained well enough to not disrupt a regular service dog).

Last month, I woke up in the middle of the night to Thor whining. I was groggy and thought he had to go to the bathroom, so I got out of bed and opened the door. At that point, my house alarm went off and pretty soon after that, I was face-to-face with my stalker. I started screaming and went to run for my gun. Before I could do anything though, Thor ran across the room in full attack mode. The memory is really blurry for me, but there was blood all over my living room and I remember my stalker was eventually able to escape, at which point Thor chased him outside and then came back to me.

When the police showed up, they said Thor was a hero who’d probably saved my life. I don’t want to list what they found in my stalker’s car after they caught him (and I’m shaking a little as I type this) but I’m sure he was going to bring me somewhere and kill me. It looks like he’s going to prison for a long time though, so my nightmare is over. Pretty much everyone in my life thinks Thor is a hero, except my SIL. She and my brother have a 4 y/o (the one I mentioned above), and she says she doesn’t want Thor around her (the child) anymore. She says since Thor has “snapped” in the past, he could do it again, so he’s not safe to have around kids (We used to see each other a few times a week before she decided Thor was dangerous). The way she words this makes me *really angry* because Thor didn’t “snap”. He saw a stranger break into his home, heard his owner scream in terror, and reacted to defend me, himself, and his house. Nothing about that screams “dangerous around children” to me, unless my niece is also going to break into my house and threaten me.

This is also a very emotional issue for me because Thor isn’t just a dog to me. He’s my safe place, my hero, the one who protected me and kept me safe when no one else could. I’ve also gotten increasingly anxious since this happened, and I can’t go anywhere without Thor. I barely leave my house, pay to pick up my groceries from the store instead of going in because I know Thor isn’t allowed inside, and all my friends know that if Thor isn’t welcome in their house, I’m not coming either (although they’re perfectly welcome to come hang out at my house instead). I am really going through it, and am working with a therapist to overcome this (luckily my office is still fully remote but I need to be able to go back to work once we’re in person again). But I really really need my brother and SIL’s support. I think my SIL thinks I’m just pouting and that’s why I won’t just leave the dog home and come over without him. I don’t know how to explain to them that the fear hasn’t stopped just because my stalker is in jail. It’s actually a lot worse than it was before. I’ve already suggested they come over and I crate Thor, but that wasn’t good enough for her. What can I do to make her understand the situation better?

tl;dr My dog took down my stalker after he broke into my house. Now I have severe anxiety and am too afraid to be without him, but my SIL thinks he’s unsafe around my 4 y/o niece. I don’t know how to make them understand that I really am too afraid to go anywhere without him and not just trying to win an argument."

Personally, I found it very mature of him to want too but, my husband disagrees and thinks it's a sign of him being lazy and immature. We've been arguing non-stop. 

My argument is so long as he is working and helping out what's the harm in him staying? Why should one be expected to abandon their kids the moment they've become adults? He's our only child; our baby. I want him to leave when he is ready. Why push him out so soon? I sort of feel that as a mother I've failed if I'm abandoning him so soon when he isn't ready."
avwpo0,I (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.,45061,0.92,5769,2019-03-01 03:33:13,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/,self.relationship_advice,0,26,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TL;DR: Found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. Asked girlfriend about it. She started yelling at me and crying and left.

I don't even know where to start with this. I'm dumbfounded. She just stormed out the house and I'm sitting on the bed asking myself A LOT of questions.

I live a pretty normal life, and I thought so did my girlfriend. We've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

This is really stupid and it shouldn't have happened but it did. Now I just want advice on how to make it better. Also this is the story my brother told me as I wasn't there.

He was in his room playing on his phone minding his own business. He got up to take out the trash. He came back to lay down im his bed. As he was laying down he noticed there dog walking out of his room. He ignored it.

Later on his sister 17 noticed clothes were missing. She went looking for it and found it in my brothers room. The problem was that is was wet and slimy. She immediately told our parents and they thought the worse. My dad, mom, and brother argued about it. 

Rude things were said. Apparently mom said I knew you were weird but not this weird. My dad said I raised a predator. In the end my parents asked me to pick him up and let him stay with me for a couple of days. When I picked him up he didn't say anything and just sat in silence.

He spent the entire time in the room he was staying in. He only came out for dinner. He skipped breakfast and lunch. His eye's were always red when he came out so I assume he was crying. I've never seen him cry. Most of the time when he's upset he just has a stone face so what they said must have got to him.

Finally at the end of the week he's parents called me and said they wanted to talk to him so they came over. Before they came over I tried to talk to him but he ignored me. When parents came they apologised to him. Over the week they noticed more of sister clothes in his room until one day my dad caught the dog with my sister clothes.

My brother just said okay and went home. I tried to ask my parents if he could stay longer but they said that wouldn't be necessary. Later on I got a call asking me what did he do over my house because he's just been in his room all day at there house. Is there anything I can do to help him feel better?

Advice would be greatly unappreciated.

Edit little update:Good news. He can stay with me until Sunday. I had to lie a little to parents to get him to come. I told them he should get out the house because he spends most of his day sitting in one spot with online school.

They didn't believe me a first but I said it would be a chance to get him out his room. They finally agreed. He was about to go to sleep so I came just in time. I think the plan right now is to just spent time with him this week. I'm broke so it's gonna be mostly home stuff.

I tried to talk to him on the car ride. I asked him if he's okay. He said he's fine and we had a little conversation about his school. So at least he's talking now. He's in the spare room so everything is okay right now.

Update 2: Here was the post that got removed

Holy shit, y’all. 
I haven’t been on reddit since I posted my original here and I did NOT expect this. I had to make an extra account with similar name to post because of the 48 hour thing, but I know a lot of people were genuinely worried about me so I wanted to go ahead and post an update (sorry if that’s not allowed). 

Thank you guys so much, I can’t even believe the support/response I got. I ended up calling my brother and telling him about it and asking him how I should handle it, and he got in his car to come get me before I even finished telling him what all had happened. Him freaking out more than anything else made me realize that I wasn’t overreacting. I didn’t tell my boyfriend I was leaving until my brother was parked on the street and I just walked out with a few things. So now I’m in a messy breakup situation where he’s already tried to come by my moms house even though I told him I didn’t want to see him and that I’d get my stuff eventually, both from his parents house where he’s currently at and his actual house. Things are gonna be weird to figure out but I just wanted to let you guys know that I’m totally okay, thank you. I can’t reply to everyone who reached out/messaged so I hope you guys see this and know I appreciate it.

Monday we decided to make the 8ish hour drive back to our home state and quarantine there instead for a few months. Right before leaving, we got into a big fight because I wanted to stay at my mothers house for a while, he doesn’t want me to, among other things I won’t get into. Well, before leaving we decided to eat dinner so we didn’t have to stop anywhere. 

Fast forward to our drive and not long after hitting the road I passed out. Don’t even really remember falling asleep. Woke up one time for a while, drank some Gatorade *which he gave me*, and then I fell asleep again. I thought this was extremely weird because I wasn’t tired hardly at all and we didn’t even leave super early. I kept commenting on how weird it was that I was tired the whole drive and slept 90% of it. 

Yesterday the tension eased a bit and he made the offhanded comment that he wishes he could drug me more when I “act out” and argue with him. I ask him what he’s talking about. Proceeds to tell me he put Benadryl in my drink and that’s why I slept, so he didn’t have to deal with me. He literally said this as though it wasn’t that big of a deal! I’m still reeling from the conversation and completely floored. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but something tells me I’m not, and it’s extremely fucked up to put medicine in drinks. I don’t know what to do"
b7lmii,Me [52M] just found out at least 4 of my 5 children [33F][30F][28M][24F][14F] are not mine.

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

gtcz33,My (23f) boyfriend (24m) wants to move in with me. I want him to live alone first.,43533,0.93,5860,2020-05-30 17:14:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gtcz33/my_23f_boyfriend_24m_wants_to_move_in_with_me_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gtcz33/my_23f_boyfriend_24m_wants_to_move_in_with_me_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,,False,"My boyfriend and I have been together 10 months. He lives with his parents (50s M+F) and younger brothers (10, 16, 18), no sisters. Before current events he was over my place basically every night. A couple nights ago he said that he wants to move in with me, if I'm up for it.

I've been to his place more than once, and I've seen how their dynamic works. His mother does everything for all 5 men in that house. Cooking, cleaning, the works. Basically all they have to do is put their laundry away after she washes/dries/irons/folds it. The reason the parents aren't forcing them to contribute is that this was the parent's agreement. He works, she's a stay at home, so she raises the kids/runs the household and he pays for everything, with one of the clauses being that as she's doing everything there's no need to involve the boys.

As a result, my boyfriend cannot do anything. I don't know how much of this is actual cluelessness and how much is him trying to get out of stuff, but he has told me, completely sincere (and I checked this with his mother), that he can't even fry an egg. Which is why, when my boyfriend suggested moving in together, I said I wanted him to live alone first.

His plan was basically to go straight from his mother's house to my flat. I told him my hesitation, which is that he can't do chores. He then offered to pay more rent (75%) in exchange for me doing all the chores. I said no. I don't want to be his mother, or his maid, I want to be his girlfriend.

Then I told him I wanted him to live alone. Go from his mothers house to his own place, figure out how to do all the things he's never done for himself, learn some basic life skills, and then revisit us living together.

This has caused a HUGE argument, biggest we've ever had. He's taken me saying he has no life skills as an insult, which it kind of was to be fair, and has basically said that clearly I don't want to live with him at all as I've pushed the moving in time back and have only said we'd ""revisit"" after a few months of him living alone, and I did say ""revisit"" because I wanted to make sure he actually knew what he was doing and wouldn't immediately switch back to offering more rent for no chores.

This was all a couple nights ago and he's just stopped talking to me. He's at his mum's, he's online, he's talking to mutual friends who have said he is responding, he just won't answer any of my calls/texts. He's told our friends what happened and they're all on his side, saying I was really mean/cruel. I love him, and I do want to live with him eventually, I just don't want to live with him if I'm doing everything, and the one thing I don't want is him paying extra for me to do all the housework.

Is there some sort of compromise, or some option I'm not seeing? What can I do to fix this?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is incapable of doing any household chores. He wants to move in together. I don't want to be his maid. We can't find a compromise and I would love any suggestions.

Update: he called me and agreed to talk. He then basically said that he was never going to be willing to learn to do anything, and even suggested dividing up the chores then I do my half and he hire a maid to do his half. Suffice to say this was something of a turn off and by the end of the conversation we broke up."

At that point, I sort of already knew what I'd be walking into. My husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. She's beautiful and thin and everything I am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. So, I talked to him about it. He encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

I walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. They were having sex. In our bed. With a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. I silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. Its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and I've returned to the hospital. He called me asking why I wasn't home and I told him my shift is extended but in reality, I'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as I type this.

I feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. I don't even know how to proceed. On one hand I want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, I'm an ugly woman....its not like I can do better. I just want to die. I feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. Advice please.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for the kind comments and support. Please stop commenting, however. I think I've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). I don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. Reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. I still have no idea what I am going to do and I know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. He was a great husband and I can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. I don't know if I will stay, but that's all I really know right now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did and while I'm incredibly grateful for all the nice and supportive comments...please please please stop messaging me about how I should stop eating or laugh at me for expecting a faithful husband while being overweight. It is incredibly upsetting and I am already going through a lot. I feel I need to clarify since everyone seems to care that I had food after I found out. I had been working a shift from 7am to 6:30pm during which I had been all over the place. I had lunch at 11am and nothing else until I left. I was starving and hurt and driving around with tears streaming down my face. Please stop harassing me about that."

Quick recap: My ex wife, who Ive known since I was 10, cheated on me but is now dying and wants me to be around before she dies.

It's been almost 3 weeks since I've posted and a lot has happened since. I got some solid advice from a lot of you guys, especially some who messaged me their personal experiences. I'd like to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart. 

So here's what happened... 

As many of you guys suggested, I talked to my wife. We had a long discussion about the whole situation and I assured her that no matter what, she is and always will be my first priority. I also assured her that while I wanted to say my good-bye, I would never act like her husband. It would be more like me seeing a childhood friend or something like that. I also told her I would never spend the night nor would I be alone with her. 

She was more comfortable after our talk and was pretty ok with the idea of me seeing my ex again. As you guys guessed, she really felt like she was forced into being ok with it when my sister asked but this time, she really was ok. 

So I talked to my sister and after a long, long heated discussion about what my ""role"" would be in the visit, she agreed to the boundaries my wife and I set. 

A week later my sister and I came over to our old marital home. It was surreal cause while the emotions from years before came back to me, I didn't feel any sadness nor hatred or anything negative. I saw my ex, who was waiting for us in the living room and she cried when I walked in. Most of you suggested she was faking it but while she was still strong, you could tell almost immediately something was wrong with her. I indulged her with a hug and we talked for a few hours while my sister made lunch. I showed her pictures of my kids and told her stories about what they're like. Honestly, I didn't know how I would react after I saw her again but it just feels like seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. There was no hate or anything like that. 

I walked around the house and it was pretty much the way it was when I left over a decade ago. Im not really sure how I feel about our wedding photos still framed and pictures of us still all over the house but it wasn't really my place to say anything. 

The three of us had lunch and played board games all afternoon. It honestly felt like we were back to when we were kids and the three of us would hang out together. It was nice. 

I left at around 6. She was sad but she understood. When I hugged her good-bye, she whispered ""I love you"" to me but then said how she's happy I was able to find the happiness she couldn't give me. That part got to me to be honest and I was fighting back tears. I told her I'd see her again soon and she asked if I could bring my kids next time. I told her I would and left to pick up dinner for my family. 

I told my wife everything that happened and she was quite happy about the outcome. I guess it helped that I brought home her favorite food but she also agreed to let me bring the kids next time. 

Overall, it was a great experience seeing her again. I feel like I needed that and would've regretted not doing so. 

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice. Also, please don't roast my ex too much. She made a mistake and paid the price but it doesn't mean shes an evil person. 

This will be my last update. Thank you very much, reddit."
ita3mx,My(26M) gf(24F) told me she is pregnant but I am sterile,43152,0.96,1136,2020-09-15 20:12:04,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ita3mx/my26m_gf24f_told_me_she_is_pregnant_but_i_am/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ita3mx/my26m_gf24f_told_me_she_is_pregnant_but_i_am/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I am from a SEA country and my first language is not english.

Backstory: I got into an accident after my college and will never be able to have kids. None of my family members know of this. They know about the accident but not about this. I have always wanted to be childfree so it did not affect me much mentally.

I have finished my Masters Degree last year and never dated before. I got a very high paying job directly through campus placements. My parents immediately wanted me to get married after getting a job but I wanted to work on myself and explore a bit. They said no and I said that it was my wish. All my life I did what they wanted and for the first time when I talked against them, they were not happy. This was last year and they gave up after covid started.

So I picked up some dating apps and went through them but no luck. Then my parents introduced me to a family friends daughter and we clicked kinda. Looking back, I was a fool. She said yes to anything I said and never complained about anything. I felt kinda weird about it. I wanted her to express her interests but she always said she was interested in whatever I do. Well, i did not think much about it.

I said that i wont have kids ever and she surprisingly said ok. I was like damn, she is probably the one as it is very hard to find a partner who is childfree in my country (or atleast i thought), but we were in the initial stages and I have not told about my accident. Long story short, we had sex a month ago, i used condoms because safety first. The next day on, she started ghosting me a bit. I thought it was due to my performance in bed and wanted to give her some space. Then she texted infrequently and only replied OKs and Ks and one line answers. I thought maybe she wanted to end the relation and was sad but left it at that.

Yesterday, all her family came to my house and she claims shes pregnant and the father is me. Needless to say, I freaked the fuck out and wanted to collapse on the ground. I did not say anything while they were talking about marriage and stuff that needs to happen because I got her pregnant.

Please advice me on what steps to take now reddit

UPDATE: Let me start off by saying im very very grateful for all the redditors who took their time to read and give me advice. I was overwhelmed by the amount of comments and how many of you said it might not even be my kid. Looking at it from a different perspective gave me much more insight on the whole situation. I called my boss and took today off.

I called up some clinics to get tested and was given a slot on Friday afternoon. Then I went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests and asked only her to come to my place tomorrow ( i.e today morning). I also called my parents and my before I said anything, my mom asked me if I had any good news, I was shocked by what she said and asked me what exactly she was talking about. She then played dumb and I knew that the situation was more fucked that I thought. I cut the call and cried all night till 3am, grown ass man crying for the first time since 8th class. 

She came today morning with her parents even after I told her to come alone. They were under the impression that I was gonna discuss engagement plans with them. I told them to wait outside and called her in and they threw a fit. I told they can all go back or let her alone come in, they said ok. 

I took out the pregnancy tests and gave it to her and told her to prove that she was actually pregnant and told her where the bathroom was. She started screaming at me(never done this before, I was shocked at this), then she went out the door and called her parents in. Now everyone is screaming at me in my own home because I asked her to prove the pregnancy not even a DNA test. I told them all to fuck off and one hour later my parents and they all came to my home and they spilled the beans. She was never actually pregnant(as many redditors said), my parents were afraid that I was getting old for marriage and wanted me to marry and give them grandchildren. They said that in arrange marriages, no need for the people to actually get to know the spouse because parents choose only the best for their kids. They planned this all and were only waiting for me to have sex with her to do this. I broke down and cried again. All my life, I did exactly what my parents wanted, always scored high and never asked for anything. I told them to get out and never talk to me again in between crying and they said parents know whats best for their kids and I should do what they say. Then I got extremely angry and told them to fuck themselves in my native language which was very bad. For once, I think they knew I was serious with them and they all left. I blocked them all before sending my parents a message to never again contact me in my life even if one of you is dying. 

Cried for some more time, went through some dog videos and went through all my messages on reddit and I feel like I owe you guys this update because it was you guys who helped me do this. That is all and I hope you have a wonderful day."

Thank you everyone for your help and advice. I did my investigating before talking to her. I went through his social media first but nothing explicitly saying anything was going on. There were a few mentions of “his love” in some comments but that could mean anything.  I did look at the phone bill and there looks to be calls with him pretty regularly. 

On to hers, I was able to get on her phone when she was asleep. (She must of forgot I knew the code) Nothing in texts and no weird calls. (So she deleted them) I did find some apps she tried to keep “hidden” like Snapchat and Kik. Sure enough, there’s their conversations. And pictures. (I took pictures of all of it on my phone to have as proof) She exploded when we had the conversation and left with our child to her mothers. 

I contacted a lawyer and am in the process of a divorce and figuring out custody. I’m heartbroken and am more angry than anything else. I’m angry at her but I’m also angry at myself for dismissing so many red flags.

ETA The conversations I found were confirming they were having an affair. The pictures were ones they were exchanging, including nudes"

Hey guys. Thank you all for your advice. My gf's grandfather came and we had our dinner yesterday, so this is an update to that post. I just want to say first, I am drunk, so please excuse any typos.

Anyway, I was really freaked out all summer about wanting to impress him. I was seriously considering  pulling the Skinner scam and buying takeout and disguising it, but I decided to just go for trying to make something myself. I spend pretty much all of July trying to make steak. I started with cheap stuff, and it was really, \*really\* hard at first, but I learned from my mistakes.

I wanted to go all out, so I bought really nice steak to make when the day came. I made three. One for all of us, and it ended up being better than I hoped, though obviously not Michelin Star quality. I also brought some really expensive (at least for a college student) Cabernet to pair, although he actually brought rum, so we had both. It's around midnight on August 16th here in the Eastern United States; this happened on the evening of August 14th (he came early due to changes in our school schedule). He said that the steak was nice. He and I went out for burgers and hotdogs the next evening (today, but technically actually yesterday). It was just him and I. We also had a metric fuck-ton of beer. All in all, it was a really positive experience, and we got along very well. I'm glad I didn't risk trying to pass off steakhouse food as my own, though I still want to try to see if I can fool my professor's friend. Maybe after the pandemic has passed (grandfather, gf, and I all got tested before meeting for dinner).

I really love my girlfriend :)"

So a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

My grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

I explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who Stan Lee was. Surprisingly she understood just perfectly. I was relieved. For a moment I thought that my dad and I would get shit from everyone.
My sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". I told her that she asked me and I just told the truth.

But what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. She again ridiculed my hobby and so on. One of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. The dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. She is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

My mom and sister came back in the morning. They didn't talk much to us . My mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. We had a short dry conversation till she asked me why I was making such a big deal about it. And I shut her up like you guys told me to. I started by explain who Stan Lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. It's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. You said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because I didn't lend her my jacket ""

Ya'll my mom cried. She apologized profusely. She said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as I was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

My mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything."

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

Edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. Stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please."

&#x200B;

Unfortunately my last post was locked, but I received a lot of helpful PMs from people. I'm particularly thankful for those who've lived through a similar situation(or have family and friends who've done so) and sent me advice on how this affected them and how to navigate the situation. I'd also like to thank the hundreds of mouthbreathing bigots who spammed my inbox.

The big takeaway for me was that if I'd need to lead by example here, not excluding her in any way because of her paternity so that she and my sons would see her as a full member of the family. Also that I need to be more active in confronting the bigoted and ignorant nonsense I've been hearing, and teach my sons to do the same to protect their sister. I've spoken to some of those responsible since and made clear my feelings on this, and that she is to be treated as a member family, and that if I ever find out that they've said things like that to my sons or their sister that they won't be allowed around us anymore.

I've spoken to my wife about this, and we're more or less on the same page. She's been begging me to forgive her and not go through the divorce, but that's not going to happen. Even if I didn't consider the cheating unforgivable, I just dont feel any love for her any more, other then a platonic affection for her as the mother of my children. 

My sons are handling this as well as can be expected. The 4 year old doesn't fully understand, but is upset by the change in the household, thankfully he's easily distracted. The 2 year old is thankfully too young to comprehend what's going on, but has definitely picked up on how withdrawn his mother has become. They're both fascinated with their new little sister, so there's that silver lining.

My wife OTOH isn't in good shape at all. She was depressed even before the birth, and now with everything- our divorce, her infidelity being revealed and the backlash from family and friends, PPD, and the exhaustion from raising an infant- she's barely functional. She's seeing a therapist, and I've been pressuring some of our family and friends to be supportive of her because even if they think she deserves it her current state is making it harder for me and our children.

It's become very obvious to me that even after the divorce is finalized we're going to have to live together for a while longer. She's in no shape to be taking care of three kids without someone else around to support her, and I'm not willing to deprive her of her sons by seeking sole custody. It's also too difficult financially, since she's lost her job because of COVID. 

As for the baby girl, she's healthy and fairly easy by baby standards. Since I've been helping care for her, I've bonded with her and I've discussed the possibility of adopting her with my wife. She can't contact the father, as the only thing she knows about him is his first name. And given our coparenting situation it feels like adopting her as my daughter would be the best outcome for all involved-

HOWEVER, there's been a wrench thrown in that plan. It was brought to my attention that there may be a way of finding the baby's father, namely by having her DNA tested by AncestryDNA. If the father or one of his relatives has also taken the test, we may be able to find him through there DNA match database.

If I'm being completely honest I'm not happy about this. I've already started to think of the baby girl as my daughter, and having him in our lives would massively complicate the family dynamic. Plus we live in Seattle and she met him in Philadelphia, so god knows how they'd even make it work if he wanted to be the kid's father.

However, I recognize that this is a selfish reaction. If we have a chance of finding her biological father we owe it to her do so, if only so that she has access to her paternal medical history and so that she can have a relationship with him if and when she chooses to do so. I've read a few accounts by children raised by non-biological parents and a common thread is their desire to meet their lost biological parent, so thats that. We've ordered an AncestryDNA kit for her, and I guess we'll decide our next steps once we get the results back in a couple of months."

We have been in a relationship for 1 year and we had a baby boy last week. I had a natural birth and my bf was there throughout the whole process. I screamed A LOT and each time I did he whispered something like ""can you stop screaming, you're really embarrassing me"". I also threw up a few times and I saw him cover his face in shame. When I held the midwife's hand for comfort he whispered ""let go of her, stop being so embarrassing"". He also said that my birthing position was embarrassing and called me a few vulgar names.

I'm really upset about his behaviour that day, especially when it was when I needed his support the most. When  I try to talk to him about it he denies ever saying it and that I'm being silly...

Edit: I know that there are a lot of comments but I am reading them all, and I just want to thank everybody for the advice and support so far. :) 
I spoke to my mum about this but she is the very traditional type and although she said his behaviour is wrong, I should try couple counselling first. I really don't think he is going to listen to me when I suggest getting help but I'll try. I am also going to talk to my public health nurse.

Edit 2: Thank you so much to everybody who commented and dmed me with words of support and those who have also been in similar situations. I have since tried to discuss the option of couple counselling to him but to no avail, which didn't surprise me. My mum has agreed to let me stay there until I can find a new place for myself and baby. I haven't said anything to him yet, I've been advised not to so I am still planning out how I am going to take the next step."

Based on the advice of you guys, my parents and my brother, I broke up with my boyfriend.

So I asked my boyfriend what he expected to happen that night if he was allowed to spend the night with me. He repeatedly said nothing but let slip that maybe he hoped we’d have sex in the morning. So you guys were right, he wanted to have sex that night with me and he probably would have if he was allowed to spend the night with me. 

Even the thought of it gives me a lot of stress. I always knew rape is a danger a lot of women (and men) face, but never felt it so close to me. Maybe because I’ve always been with people I trust. I don’t know. I never thought it could happen so easily to me. It would have happened to me that night if my brother hadn’t protected me the way he did.

I’m going to be a lot more careful about my own safety from now on. I won’t be as trusting to strangers and I’m now learning my drinking limits so that I won’t overdo it especially where I might be vulnerable. My brother also told me to never accept a drink from the people I don’t 100% trust.

I tried to teach her a lesson and really hurt her feelings.,40600,0.94,6669,2020-05-24 00:15:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gpa82s/my_36m_wife_34f_keeps_tying_my_boots_after_ive/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gpa82s/my_36m_wife_34f_keeps_tying_my_boots_after_ive/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Yes, I know the title is bizarre and I can't believe I'm actually writing this. My wife is a neat freak. Always has been. She throws notes on my desk out assuming they're garbage, my belongings get rearranged to the point where it takes me hours to find them, it's something I've come to accept. I'm not happy about it, but we have a pretty happy marriage on the whole.

I am a volunteer EMT, and I keep my boots unlaced up against the wall next to my clothes hamper so that I can throw them on along with my uniform if a call comes in during the middle of the night.  Well, my wife has taken to tying the boot laces when she sees them untied. Not only does she tie them, but she tightens them and double knots them to the point where I need to undo the knot, open up the boots, and let a little slack out to fit my feet into them.  I ignored it the first two times, but the third time she did it, I made it a point to bring up to her the next day.

I very calmly said, ""Hun, I appreciate that you want everything neat, but please do not touch my boots in the future. Time is of the essence when I'm going on a call and at 2 in the morning I don't have the time to unlace them and open them up. It's not just a minor inconvenience, it's people's lives, so I would appreciate it if you left them alone.""

She rolled her eyes, said I was being dramatic, and that she wouldn't help me out by keeping my things neat in the future.

Well she never stopped. No matter how many times I've asked her, told her, begged her; she just laughs and says, ""Well you know how I am!""

The other night a page went out for a CPR in progress.  I went to throw my boots on and they were, once again, tightened beyond recognition.  So I'm sitting there on the edge of the bed, cursing, trying to get my boots open, and fumbling due to the stress of the situation.

My wife opened her eyes, groggily looked at me, and asked, ""Don't you need to go on that call?""

I know I was in the wrong here, and I regret it. I slammed the boot into the ground and yelled, ""Yes! I do! I would have been out the door five minutes ago, except SOME STUPID MOTHERFUCKER FUCKED WITH MY GODDAMN BOOTS AGAIN!""

My wife got up without another word, walked into the bathroom and slammed the door. I got my boots open and went on the call. By the time we arrived, the police had gotten her back, so I didn't have to do CPR, but I was sweating and shaking thinking my delay could have cost a life.

I got home and my wife wasn't talking to me. She ignored me the entire day until we finally sat down and talked. She said I had scared her with how angry I got, that she thought I was going to hit her, and she didn't know I was capable of getting so angry. Note: I have never raised a hand to her, nor have I ever yelled at her before; I am absolutely not a violent person in any way shape or form.

I apologized for yelling at her, and acknowledged that I hadn't meant to snap at her, I was frustrated with the situation as I needed to get to the person in need of CPR as soon as possible and it was a delay that didn't need to happen.  I, once again, pleaded with her not to touch my boots because lives were literally on the line.

She told me that if I was going to overreact and make her afraid then she would never touch my boots again because she didn't want to live like that.

Last night, before I got into bed, I had a sinking feeling, so I went over and checked my boots.  I was very disappointed to find them tightened up again.  So I decided to show her how it felt. I went over to her closet and pulled out her running shoes.  I unlaced the shoelaces on both of them, removed them from the shoes completely, curled them each into a little coil, put them inside the shoes, and put them back.  I then went to sleep.

At 6:15 I was woken up by my wife screaming, ""How could you!? Why would you do this?"" holding up both laceless shoes with tears in her eyes.  My wife likes to go for an early morning run and I knew she would want to get out the door as soon as possible.

I smiled and said, ""You know how I am! I just like things neat!"" She continued sobbing and walked out of the room.  So, by the time she was all laced up again, it was raining so she missed out on her run.  I actually feel pretty terrible about that because I really only wanted to delay her, not ruin her plans completely.

At this point, she's alternating between crying that I went out of my way to hurt her and ignoring my presence. I acknowledge that what I've done has been pretty childish and not at all constructive. I just don't know what to do.

She said, through tears, ""You admitted you were totally in the wrong for yelling at me, and then you turned around and took it out on me in a different way! What is wrong with you?""

The problem is, to her, an apology means taking on 100% of the fault.  When I apologized for blowing up, she took that to mean she was 100% in the right and that my feelings were completely unjustified. So at this point, I haven't apologized for ruining her run, because she'll take that to mean that she wasn't wrong to touch my boots.

I've tried to have these discussions but it's in one ear and out the other.  We have such a good relationship otherwise, but I feel like this issue has reached a tipping point and it's going to continue to result in arguments until we resolve it.

How do I make things right with my wife while still letting her know that I won't tolerate her disrespecting my property anymore?

Edit: Wow! This blew up! I went through comments for six hours last night and I still have 1.8k to get through.  I promise you I am reading every one of your comments and appreciate the advice.  A couple things to address points that keep getting brought up.

1. My wife has never been diagnosed as having OCD. As an EMT, I'm very careful about labeling someone as having a disorder as I don't have the proper qualifications to make that diagnosis. I do agree that it's time for her to see somebody, get a proper diagnosis, and address these issues.
2. My boots lace up in the front and zipper on the side. They're not a full unzip but rather an unzip to open them up a bit. The way my wife is tying them makes them impossible to get on even with the zipper down. They're weather proof and great for standing on rough terrain or the highway after accidents. They're only about a year old and were actually a gift from my wife. I've not considered Velcro before, I'm a bit hesitant to do that as I don't know that they wouldn't catch on things or wear out quicker.  I've tucked the laces in but she still tied them up.
3. This is a bit of compulsive behavior on my part. I don't leave my boots in the garage because my mother was a smoker growing up and that's where she would smoke. So I would end up with ashes in my shoes and having them reek of tobacco after. So I developed a habit of wearing them into my home. Also, if I leave them there, they're likely to get moved someplace 'safe' where it will take me even longer to find them.  Putting the boots in the closet, she found them and tied them.  Putting them under the bed or out of sight they were found, tied, and moved to the closet.
4. I honestly believe that a footlocker or any other kind of box would get moved to where I would have to wake her up to find it. If it's locked, then my keys are likely to go missing. For some reason, sitting on my dresser is not appropriate but in the pocket of a jacket downstairs in the closet is.
5. I am likely going to start putting my boots in the car. Though I had to laugh at the people suggesting decoy boots. As much as it may seem like it, I'm not living in a Spy vs. Spy cartoon.
6. I am a volunteer EMT. We respond from home. We don't have sleeping quarters, and I work the overnight shift so I sleep during my shift, get out of bed when a call comes in, drive to the building, and take the ambulance to the scene. This is typical of volunteer organizations.  Paid EMS is more likely to have sleeping quarters or even require EMTs to be in the truck throughout their shift. Community based EMS is more likely to take 911 calls and respond to emergencies whether paid or volunteer.  Private EMS is more likely to take transport requests such as to/from dialysis or chemotherapy as well as hospital to nursing facility discharges.
7. To those who have told me that I don't have the right to use the word lifesaving, on my dress uniform I have pins for 3 defibrillator saves and 4 for CPR saves. I've crawled into a car wreck to open someone's airway and bag them until we could get them out. While transporting a patient I recognized signs of internal injury and ordered we divert to a trauma center, where he was put directly into emergency surgery that saved his life.  Did I do these things entirely by myself? No, of course not. I would never claim that I was the sole reason someone lived. However, I am, at my very basest level, as vital link in the chain or survival. So while I can't claim complete credit for any of the things I've done, I would certainly put a lot of blame on myself if someone didn't live because of something I failed to do.
8. I have a full-time job that I work 8-5 Monday - Friday outside of EMS.  That is why I volunteer on the night shift. My wife works as a payroll manager for a mid-sized office.  I earn about $10,000 a year more than her.  We've been married for two years. While I lived on my own before we were married, she didn't move into the apartment until we got engaged. So, I think to her, that was my place, not ours, and she didn't really touch my things.  I was with another EMS organization until we moved to a new town after our engagement.  When we bought the house, I joined the local volunteer squad as an EMT. My wife regards my job as part of my identity while she sees the EMS as something I volunteer to do. She would say, ""This is my husband, he is \[job title\],"" not ""This is my husband, he is an EMT.""
9. Thank you for all the awards on this post. You're all very kind. I appreciate so much that you took the time out of your day to acknowledge things and want to help me.

tl;dr Wife keeps tightening my boots when I'm not wearing them, delaying me on ambulance calls. I finally had enough, and she's calling my response abuse."
gswmw3,"I [46M] promised my son [18M] that his mother and I would match whatever he saved for a car upon his high school graduation. He ended up with a lot more than we could have predicted, and now we don’t know what to do.",40411,0.9,6705,2020-05-29 22:25:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gswmw3/i_46m_promised_my_son_18m_that_his_mother_and_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gswmw3/i_46m_promised_my_son_18m_that_his_mother_and_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"When he turned 16 and got his license, we allowed him to use an old car from a relative. At that time, my son had around $5k in savings. We made him a promise saying that we’d match whatever he ended up with at graduation. Reasonably, we thought he’d maybe double that to $10k through jobs and we’d match for a reasonable $20k car. 

He now has $35k to use for a car. He said he did have a little over $10k but that he bought smart stock options in April and now will have around $35k after tax (personally I don’t think he did anything besides get stupid lucky). 

He is insisting that we follow through with our promise and match that. Financially, it’s not a huge dent for us since he also surprised us with a nice merit scholarship (that he did *earn*). The problem arises in that we really don’t want to break the promise we made to him, but we also strongly believe that an 18 year old driving around in a **SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR** car is a very bad idea. He can’t even take it to school until his sophomore year, and the insurance on that will be a nightmare. 

What I am asking is, would the better course of action be to break the promise, and likely face resentment? Or keep it and cough up the money?

Thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit: Talked about it with my wife; we are considering a couple of avenues atm including trust or maybe fixed income until it can be used for med school. My son uses Reddit and considering that this is on r/all now, I’m just waiting for him to see it and burst into my home office room.

Edit2: He’s super duper close with his girlfriend. I told her, and she said she’d talk him out of it. Personally, I totally understand where my son is coming from. I wanted a car like that at that age too, and my parents did end up indulging just a little bit, but now I can see how it was a waste of money. I only used it for two years. I’ll make an update post in a few days about what happens."
fpxm56,"My wife ""baby-trapped"" me",39520,0.9,1615,2020-03-27 19:43:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fpxm56/my_wife_babytrapped_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fpxm56/my_wife_babytrapped_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,12,,text,False,False,False,"I put baby-trap in quotation marks because I'm not sure what she did is the actual definition of baby trap, she didn't have a kid to make me stay, just against my will.

So my wife (32F) and I (34M) have been together for eight years. We have a little girl (5F) and a baby boy (2M). I love both of them more than anything and I finally feel like I have everything. A beautiful wife, two healthy kids, a great career, and a big house. The token ""American Dream"", minus the dog, I'm allergic.   
When we talked about kids before, my wife always said she wanted two. I only wanted one, it would be easier and we'd have more money for vacations and stuff, but my wife maintained it's important for a child to have a sibling. I grew up with four and my wife with none, so I guess I understand where she's coming from. 

After our son and getting through the baby years and sleepless nights for the second time, I didn't want to ever go through that again. Both kids were very fussy and colicky. But when he was a year old, my wife began casually mentioning a third. I would laugh it off but finally she sat me down and said we have to have a third. I said no, we agreed on two, but she said she wanted *four* and three is the compromise. I refused and said I wanted one and we have two. She got angry and called me selfish for taking away her dream of wanting a big family.

A couple days later, she apologized and we had sex. I noticed her drive increased exponentially but so did mine and I was happy to engage her. She was on birth-control, I had a condom, it was all good. Thinking back on it, I probably should have figured something was up, but I was barely handling two little kids and work on top of housework and yardwork and everything. 

I came home from work one day, while the kids were at their grandparents. My wife had a huge smile on her face and she sat me down and showed me a positive pregnancy test, literally dancing in joy.

My first thought was, ""*oh shit*."" My wife noticed a less-than-happy expression on my face and started screaming at me. She berated me for not being supportive and this was a ""miracle from God"" and I should be grateful. I said I was sorry and hugged her and said I was super excited for the baby. My wife was delighted and later that night she was calling all family and friends to happily tell them the news. When she was talking about the nursery and how we'll convert my office into a room I started to get a little suspicious. Everything was so well thought-out and it seemed like she'd been planning this for a while. 

When she was asleep, I took the condoms out of the cupboard and ran them under water. Holes.   
I nabbed her phone and saw she'd set a password. That was odd. Nevertheless, my wife has a terrible memory so I tried her birthday and it opened. Further up were texts with her best friend of my wife complaining how I wouldn't come around. Her best friend suggested ""arrange an accident"" with a winky face. My wife agreed and said she was going to come off of birth control. It went on for a little while, ending with my wife saying that yes, we *were* going to have a 3rd. 

So I woke her up immediately and asked her if this had really been a ""miracle""? She got that deer-in-headlights look and burst into tears. She wailed and then she got angry. Through tears she screamed I had no right to go through her phone and it's her choice whether or not she wants to take BC, the side-effects are bad and she was sick. She also brought up if I really didn't want a third kid, I should have had a vasectomy. She told me to go sleep on the couch, I laughed out loud and said no, I'm sleeping here, you're leaving. So while wailing she packed a bag and left to her parents. When she called the next day I told her I just need some time to myself. She said that's fine but I need to come around for our child. I told her I wasn't sure if it'd be ""our child"" and she cried more.

It's been two weeks since then. Governments recommended to stay at home and I knew staying home by myself while also working with two kids would not be ideal and she wanted to see our kids. So we're  in the same house, she constantly keeps on stopping me and trying to get me excited for our kid and planning the nursery and names and how happy our kids will be to get a younger sibling. I've been ignoring her entirely. 

What do I do? Staying home with her is bad enough and I don't know if I should leave her over this. I don't trust her anymore. She entirely betrayed it. I'm angry. But I have another child on the way."
c225le,UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,39290,0.9,7492,2019-06-18 18:48:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

I thought I'd update y'all since so many people commented on my previous post. 

As I said in earlier, I wrote her a letter and it was much more difficult than I thought it would be. But I wrote what was in my heart and how much I loved her and thanked her for supporting me. 

I made some of her favourite snacks and took her to a small park nearby. We ate and watched the sunset together and then I gave her the letter I wrote. She cried and hugged me and we sat there talking about future aspects. And then I showed the post to her. She welled up again and asked if she could come to a few therapy sessions with me so that she could understand better what I was going through. Also it might help her not burn out. I will talk to my therapist about it and we'll see how it turns out. 

But that's about it. We went home, watched a movie and went to bed. I seriously feel so lucky to have her in my life

 Here's to hoping for our best future together. 

Oh and, I seriously cannot thank you guys enough. Every single one of you who commented (even the rude ones) have made a difference. Seriously y'all are amazeballs. (I know many said to not say it ever again, but I like it so) 

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart."
ic4aos,My [23F] boyfriend [25M] used the dog's savings for a computer,39094,0.9,1001,2020-08-18 21:58:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ic4aos/my_23f_boyfriend_25m_used_the_dogs_savings_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ic4aos/my_23f_boyfriend_25m_used_the_dogs_savings_for_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I know the title is a little odd but it was the best way I could summarize what he's done. 

I have an 11-year old senior German Shepard. He was hit by a car in 2018 and we went through a very difficult recovery process. He had seizures, urine issues, constant fear of anything going fast near him like I couldn't throw a ball anymore. We had another puppy but our senior was so stressed we had to rehome her. You would have sworn he was displaying abused behavior but he was just scared. 

He's moved past all of that and I'm so proud of him. The vet prescribed zoniamide for his seizures and so far he's been recovering well. We were discussing ways to improve his ""mobility"". Its like a walking cane, but for dogs, and it has sensory objects on the end to prevent him from bumping into furniture. We tested it in the office and his mood improved instantly but at that time I couldn't afford more treatment for him so I opted to come back.

I met D earlier this year while walking him. He's known since day 1 that my dog requires special treatment and I would absolutely provide it. Everything went well and he wasn't controlling or abusive. Everything just ""clicked"" but its my fault because I was too comfortable. We were talking about finances and I told him about my debt and the money I was saving up for my dog. After paying off the debt from his previous treatments I didn't want to open another card so I started saving cash in a little fireproof chest. He stole it. Yesterday, I went to his place I noticed he has a new setup. I was asking him where he got the money from and we fought and he said ""he's half dead anyway, you need to let go"". 

He's not even close to dying. He's a little older but he's nowhere near dying age. We go to the veterinarian regularly and everything checks out as well as it can be given his circumstances. No one has ever mentioned death, we've only been looking at the future and improvements. 

I'm so upset, what do I do? We're both students I don't want to call the police and ruin his future but that was for my baby to get what he needed so he can walk around my home comfortably."

So I got lots of feedback on what to do here. A good majority of the commenters told me to say something. To clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but I was never planning on doing nothing. Of course you gotta tell your bro if they’re being cheated on. I just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

Some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. Some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which I ended up getting from Alison, the third party friend. Some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me I was a bad friend. Some were sure he wouldn’t believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. Well all of you were somewhat right. Here’s how it went down: 

I messaged Alison early on in the day, shortly after I made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. I said to Alison that I needed to tell Aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. This was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

Aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that Alison came over too. We all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about Mary. Alison showed him the text screenshots of Mary talking to her ex, and also told Aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

What was the most surprising was his reaction. He took it very well. He first got very quiet, and just nodded. Aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. He was not aware of the hookups, but he and Mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn’t allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. He told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. There were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. He knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn’t true. 

We started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. He cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would’ve given her anything. Then he got angry. At her, and even more so at the guy. Some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

Ultimately he told us that he’s going to be breaking it off at least for now. We told him a million times how much better he deserved. He’s definitely not going to marry her. 

Thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. We saved a good man from heartbreak!

Edit: Jesus Christ this exploded fast. Thanks for all the kind words people 😅"

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

UPDATE: The paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )"

Anyway so last night I tried my best to make her cum but in the end she told me to ""just stop"" so I did. Then she said ""your brother turned me on so much more than you do"". I was so shocked by her saying that I didn't know what to say back. She got dressed and left the house and we haven't spoken yet.

I just feel so confused about how I feel. I know I'm not as attractive as my brother but I didn't think she would say that. Am I just being a baby and getting upset over nothing? I understand she's probably fed up and she might have just said it in the moment."

Thanks to everyone who replied to my previous post. There were some mixed responses, with some people suggesting I insist on addressing it with her because she's hiding something, with others recommending I give her time to open up on her own.

Ultimately I decided to sort of go for a combo of the two. Friday, when we were both done with work, we sat down and had a discussion.

I told her that I could give her the space and time she needed till she was ready to talk to me about it, but I couldn't leave it unaddressed. She needed to acknowledge that there atleast WAS something that she didn't feel ready to tell me, and that was fine, but she atleast needed to acknowledge its existence, if only so I stopped feeling like I was going crazy.

She started sobbing when I was done and then she started explaining everything.

Some background that I didn't mention in my previous post because it didn't really seem relevant is that my girlfriend has PCOD. One of the consequences of this is that she finds it very difficult to lose weight and has been insecure about her body for most of her life. About a year ago (completely of her own choice, I have always told her that she's beautiful to me no matter what her weight), she resolved to start losing weight, both for her health and to feel better about her body. She started going to the gym a couple times a week, and I was supportive and also cut out all my own junk food consumption in solidarity.

Since the lockdown started and gyms shut, apparently she started slowly gaining some weight back due to stress eating and lack of exercise. I am ashamed to say I did not even notice that she was torturing herself over her weight all this while. She admitted that she stopped having sex because she was terrified I would stop finding her attractive after seeing her naked. I reassured her that I think she's gorgeous and attractive no matter what and I tell her this everyday, but she was afraid that would have changed once I saw the weight she had put on.

The rest of the conversation consisted of me reassuring her that she's beautiful and her appreciating but not really believing me. After a bit, she asked me to change the topic, and I reluctantly agreed. We had a fairly quiet dinner, she was a little sad and relieved at the same time at having told me, I think. And I was busy scheming.

The next morning before work I told her she looked lovely again and she gave me a wan smile, like she appreciated it but didn't really believe me. But that was okay. I was gonna convince her. I asked her to pick up the groceries that evening because I was gonna have a meeting run late.

The moment she left home, I got to work. I dug out some fairy lights and a bunch of candles from storage and started setting them up in the living room. Made a couple of playlists and charged the speaker. Snuck down to the florist and bought a giant bouquet.

Some more background, I hate dancing because I suck massively at it, while my girlfriend loves it. She used to go dancing every month or two with her girlfriends before lockdown. I'd join in sometimes because it was worth how happy it made her, but she definitely missed it way more than me.

So when she got back, naturally I greeted her with what were probably the most ridiculous dance moves in the history of mankind.

I'm not gonna lie, folks. She laughed. She laughed a lot. She took a short video, and we both laughed while watching it later. My movement resembled a five year old practicing kung fu more than it resembled dancing, and I had stuck a rose in my ear for maximum ridiculousness. Totally worth it, though. I have no idea how she ever thought she's ugly, her smile is just so fucking radiant.

We danced like idiots for a while before I switched to the slow dance playlist. It was definitely the happiest I'd seen her in a long time. I'd been a bad boyfriend and somehow missed how much she missed everything else. I should have done it months ago.

I told her all this. Told her she's the most beautiful woman in my eyes and always will be. And yeah, we had sex. Last night was all about her. She needed to feel special and I had been missing that for too long.

I offered to make dance nights a weekly thing afterwards. Kind of as a substitute for the workouts she's been missing, if she wants. She tore up a little, she knows how much I hate dancing. She told me that wasn't necessary.

Apparently sex is just as much of a workout as dancing. And we have a lot of missed workouts to catch up on. I'm certainly not complaining.

In all seriousness though, I'm gonna dip into my savings a little and order a home treadmill. She can't afford one right now because of college bills, so I'll surprise her with it :)

Thank you to everyone who helped me out with their advice!

Edit: Oh wow, I am completely overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support here. Thanks for all the awards! I just logged back into this account but I promise I'm going to read each of the replies. One thing I saw pop up a couple of times that I just wanna reassure you guys about is that she's mentioned wanting a treadmill but not being able to afford one several times in the past, so I know she wants one.

However, I figured that it's dumb to take the chance, and one surprise was good enough, and if there's anything this whole experience has taught me, it's the importance of communication. So I'm going to bring it up at dinner tonight that I comfortably have enough saved up to purchase a home workout machine (since I saw cycles/ellipticals being mentioned, we'll figure out which one we want!), and that I'd love to buy one for our home for both of us to use. Thank you all so much once again for your advice!

Edit 2: RIP me, lol, the comments are coming faster than I can read them now. There's no way for me to reply to every one of them, unfortunately. There are a lot of fantastic suggestions for diets, exercise machines, dance classes and everything in between, so thank you so much for all of them! She has a great endocrinologist, who's advice she will ultimately be following, but there are some great points to bring up with him. It is really touching and overwhelming to see all this support. Thank you all so much!

Final Edit: She loved the idea of getting some equipment to do our workouts at home together, so we're going to sit down and do our research tonight before picking the one we like most. We've gotten some fantastic advice here and we'll be looking at ellipticals, bikes, rowing machines, Just Dance on the Switch and a bunch of other stuff that you guys suggested.

To all the people who commented to insist she's cheating on me because I'm a simp (lmao), thank you for setting the exemplary standard for being macho. Insulting strangers online is so delightfully masculine. The lovely folks who told me to dump her ""because she's fat"" get the ""disappointing but not unexpected shitheads"" shout-out as well.

For the overwhelming majority of people, though, I am just breathtaken by the kind and supportive comments we've gotten. Thank you for the treasure trove of advice and LPTs, and all the love! You folks are amazing!"

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.

TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before."

#That ""Half Blurred Nude"" everyone's talking about is Rick Astley. Please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**

**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here’s what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she’s closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn’t pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that’s with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there’s a “google assistant” command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There’s her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she’s cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

My sister and her daughter Rachel were there too. She's a year older than Laura and they don't get along. In fact we try to avoid them as much as we can due to amount of times that Rachel has upset and tormented Laura. Rachel is naturally very smart and is always top of her class, and is also very pretty. While I've always been happy for her and wished her the best, these things have constantly been used to excuse her. My sister even went as far as to accuse Laura of lying because she is jealous of Rachel's looks and talents.

Laura took up boxing last year and has progressed really well. She's going to compete at a higher level next year and her coach is extremely proud of her. My sister has insisted that the boxing is nothing more than ''a phase'' and has gone out of her way to downplay it in favour of her daughter's academic stuff.

At my parents place Laura went to sort out some presents under the tree, and Rachel followed her. She was wearing stiletto high heels, and when Laura had her hand on the floor Rachel stamped on it. She was in agony.

We went to the hospital, and after a follow up visit to the doctor today Laura needs extensive physio, and will not be able to box for an indefinite period. She's in floods of tears because of this.

I was raging at my sister, who is so deluded that she insists that it was an accident. I'm sorry, but after years of calling Laura ugly, stupid, fat and anything else she could think of do you really expect me to believe that this was an innocent mistake? Rachel for her part put on the crocodile tears for everyone, and only her parents believed it.

My husband wants to tell the police and I do too. I warned my sister about this, and she broke down crying too, saying that her daughter's teachers have encouraged her to apply to the top universities because they think she's got a good chance of getting in, and that if she ends up with a criminal record then that will be ruined.

No sympathy from me. Frankly Rachel took something that my daughter loves away from her and left her in huge amounts of pain. She shouldn't just have her chances ruined, she should get locked up.

I know it sounds awful of me but she did an awful thing and needs to face the consequences. Laura is utterly heartbroken and Rachels parents won't punish her."

Final Update:

I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. I got a lot more responses than I had thought I would, so I apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It’s been a very hard couple of days and I’ve been grieving, as has my family. 

We were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. I was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. She was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she’s in a better place and not in pain. 

Thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice I was given."

**ORIGINAL** post for anyone hasn’t read it (the update is below) –

Link –  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ift0zm/i\_think\_my\_sils\_23f\_best\_friend\_23f\_is\_trying\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ift0zm/i_think_my_sils_23f_best_friend_23f_is_trying_to/)

My SIL (23/F) is my husband’s (28/M) half-sister, she was the product of their mother’s infidelity. His father divorced their mother when he was 12 after he found out through a paternity test she wasn’t his. My FIL refused to have anything to do with my SIL but continued to have a relationship with my husband, because of this my SIL is very clingy to my husband. My husband is also very protective of his sister and generally doesn’t tolerate anything negative being said about her, which is why I’m posting this here before mentioning anything to him.

My husband and I bought a house last year which has its own indoor swimming pool. My SIL was super excited when she saw it and asked if she could use it sometimes with her friend. We said it was fine, as long as she gave us a notice before she turned up. Her and her friend (Chloe) have used it many times before but almost never when my husband is home (he is a lawyer and works long hours). With lockdown, my husband has started to work from home. My SIL asked me if she and Chloe could come over and use the pool, I told her I was uncomfortable with them coming over as I’m pregnant and don’t want to accidentally expose the baby to anything risky. My SIL then asked if she and Chloe quarantined for two weeks would they be able to come over, my husband said it was fine.

Two weeks later they turn up to my house. My husband was in his office, so they go straight to the pool after making small talk. My husband ends up coming out after an hour and we’re hanging out in the kitchen. My SIL walks in to get a drink and she starts talking to my husband. Before she goes back to the pool, she says “Chloe’s going to be so happy to see you”. It was weird because my husband and Chloe aren’t close. Chloe comes into the kitchen two minutes later and spends the rest of her time talking to my husband until he excuses himself to get back to work. She’s super giggly and smiley when she talks to him. He would say something sarcastic and she would laugh like it was the funniest joke she’s ever heard. It honestly felt like she was flirting with him. Before she went back to the pool, she gave me this weird smirk-y look. Before they leave, they ask my husband if he’s working from home everyday of the week, he confirms he is.

The next two weeks, they come over to the house to ‘swim’ every single day. Except, Chloe never gets in the water. Instead she hangs around the house in her bikini (she was previously wearing a one-piece if it makes a difference) every single day. Whenever my husband comes out to hang around me, she quickly interrupts him and keeps him talking until he has to go back to work. I made lunch for us all and when I excused myself to call my husband down, my SIL quickly stopped me and said Chloe could call him for me. They shared a look and Chloe looked really happy when she went to get him. Chloe has also started to get touchier with my husband. She’s put her hands on his chest and arms, stands or sits really close to him. To my husband’s credit he does usually create space between them whenever she does something like this.

The reason I believe my SIL is in on this is because she’s made a few pregnancy-related jabs at me recently. She told me a story about how one of her friend’s boyfriends was cheating on her and then said something along the lines of “did you know a lot of men start cheating when their wives are pregnant?”. She’s also made comments about how I look chubby now and it looks weird next to my husband because he’s ‘well-built’. If she spots my husband out of the office she quickly goes to inform Chloe.

I know pregnancy hormones can mess with a person’s brain so I’m wondering if I’m just looking for something that isn’t there. My SIL sent me a text yesterday asking if they could come over to swim next week and I really want to say no but I know she’ll whine to my husband if I do. I ideally want to have a conversation with him before then but I’m not sure if I should mention the flirting.

Am I being delusional?

TL;DR – SIL’s and her friend are constantly asking to come over to use our pool but her friend never swims. Instead, she waits around to start talking with my husband. She seems very flirtatious whenever she talks to him but I’m not sure if it’s just pregnancy hormones getting to me.

**UPDATE –**

Well, I read and reread all of the comments on the original post to try and figure out how I was going to bring up the issue. Turns out, I didn’t have to. We were watching a movie and my phone lit up with another text from my SIL telling me she was now going to be here at 1pm the next day to swim with Chloe. My husband saw it and told me to tell her not to come. This is really weird behaviour for my husband because he tends to do anything to accommodate my SIL and very rarely refuses her anything. I asked him if something had happened and he shrugged it off and we kept watching the movie.

A few minutes later he paused the movie and said he wanted to ask me a question. He asked if I’d noticed Chloe never swam when she came to our house. I wish I could say I was calm and collected like the comments were advising but… I ended up laughing hysterically. I was honestly just so relieved he’d brought it up instead of me having to be the one to do it. I think my husband thought I was losing my mind.

When I finally stopped laughing, he repeated the question and said he wanted a serious answer. I said, “of course I’ve noticed” and he awkwardly replied “so… you must’ve noticed the other thing too”. To summarise the conversation that followed: My husband hadn’t noticed Chloe was flirting with him the first few days because he was so busy with work, he wasn’t really paying attention to anything else. He said when she started getting handsy is when he suddenly had the ‘light bulb’ moment that she was into him. He says he didn’t want to unnecessarily stress me out, so he never mentioned anything, but he was worried I’d noticed too and thought he was interested because he hadn’t immediately shut it down. He realised we would eventually have to have this talk, but he wasn’t sure how to bring it up (oh the irony). He did privately speak to Chloe and told her he was happily married and wasn’t interested in starting anything with anyone else. Apparently, she never took him seriously because she kept doing it.

In the end, he called his sister on Sunday to tell her either she got her to stop or Chloe couldn’t come over anymore. His sister ended up having a tantrum and said a few nasty things about me/the baby/our relationship. She insisted I was somehow behind his request and made some comments about how I was controlling and insecure because I looked like a ‘beach whale’ and Chloe was younger and hotter. He was pretty pissed at this and said if she said something like that about me again, he would stop speaking to her. She claimed I had baby trapped him and when my husband pointed out we were already married so I didn’t need to ‘trap’ him and that he was the one who wanted to start a family she kept insisting I had manipulated him into feeling that way. She claimed he was unhappy in our relationship and he always looked ‘tired’ because I was forcing him to slave away to fund my fancy lifestyle, whilst I sat on my ass all day. He pointed out he chose to be a lawyer knowing he would have to work long hours and I had only recently left my job, so her accusations were baseless.

She said some other stuff along the same lines but the thing that made my husband finally snap was when she said ‘it’ (the baby) was already ruining everything and it was just going to get worse when it was born and he should’ve dragged me to the abortion clinic whilst he had the chance. He told her neither her nor Chloe were welcome in our home anymore until they apologised for how they’d been behaving and for the things my SIL said. He said he wasn’t sure he could ever forgive or forget what she’d said about our child even if she did apologise and he couldn’t believe she would even think something like that, let alone say it. Apparently, she started crying and said she was sorry, that she didn’t mean it and she was just scared to lose him and that she wasn’t thinking clearly. He hung up on her. He showed me his phone and she’s been calling him and texting him since begging him to reply.

He asked if she’d said anything to me. I was debating whether to say anything or not, but he kept insisting he knew she had said something, and he wanted to know what it was. I told him the things I mentioned in the original post and a few other things she had said. He asked me why I never mentioned anything when she first said it and I mentioned how he got really defensive whenever I said anything even slightly negative about his sister and he… got defensive. I pointed out he was doing it again and after some back and forth he admitted that “maybe he was a little bit defensive when it came to her” but he promised to stop and he wanted to make sure we could talk about anything, including his sister.

He ended up mentioning wanting to try couples counselling. He said it wasn’t because he thought there was something wrong with our relationship but apparently he has been speaking to his dad a lot recently and he mentioned one thing he regretted about his marriage with MIL is that they never went to therapy until the cracks in their relationship were too big. In his current marriage they go, and it’s helped him avoid the mistakes of his first marriage. I agreed, so we’re probably going to try that soon.

My husband thinks my SIL will eventually turn up even if we tell her not to, but he promised he’d deal with her if she does.

So, reddit I guess you were right. I really did just need to speak to him. Thanks for the advice and comments, I enjoyed reading them all.

TL;DR – We talked. Husband already confronted both the friend and SIL. SIL said some really shitty things so we won’t be contacting her for a while. Communication is key folks! ;)"

This update was long overdue so I apologize to everyone who waited for this. I've had daily messages asking me about what happened and now that I'm in a better place to actually talk about it, I can tell everyone about what happened. 

First of all, thank you to the redditors who pointed out that I should tell my wife first before confronting my brother. You were right, she did appreciate the fact that I gave her control over the situation. 

I told my wife the next day after posting and needless to say, she did not take it well. She says she feels violated and unsafe in her own home. See, the thing is my wife and I have been together for almost 15 years so we literally saw this kid grow up. We took him out to the movies, to the beach, etc. We sometimes even joked to my parents that he was our practice baby. My wife has a tendency to distrust people in general, as a lot of people in her life have let her down in the past. Imagine how hurt and betrayed she was when she found out someone she trusted and loved dearly betrayed her like that. Honestly, if I wasn't consoling my wife then, I probably would've gone through with the initial idea and beat the ever living crap out of my brother. 

After she calmed down and went to sleep, I called my sister and talked about the situation. My sister and I are close, given that we're Irish Twins. I feel like she needed to know cause she has 2 teenage daughters herself and who knows what my brother would do to them if given the chance. We talked and she was clearly mad. She loves my wife like a sister and they're quite close themselves. She said she would support whatever decision we make and that our brother would also be unwelcome at her place for the foreseeable future. 

Then we confronted my brother. At first he denied it but when I showed him the evidence, he started ugly crying and begging us to forgive him. I gave him an ultimatum... Either he lets me in his phone laptop and delete everything, or I call the police. There was so much more shit on his computer than I initially thought. So many more stolen pictures of my wife that we're definitely taken without consent. The fucker even recorded the audio of us having sex. Who does that? So after hours of me looking for as much shit as possible, and pretty much clearing most of his hard drive, he eventually left without much of a fight. Oh and we definitely threw out my wife's defiled underwear and are most likely going to have the room he stayed in cleaned professionally. 

I checked and thankfully he didn't have any hidden cameras anywhere. Oh and if you're wondering how he got pictures of my wife in a towel... The shower for the masters doesn't have hot water yet so my wife uses the shared one in the same area. She would usually walk out of the bathroom with just a towel on and go change in our walk in closet. This shouldn't have been a problem cause the guest bedroom was in a different part of the house far from the main bedrooms and it had its own bathroom so my brother had no reason for being there. 

Needless to say, my wife is still shaken up about the whole thing, which is why I didn't think about writing an update until now. I'm sorry but my wife's well-being is my priority above anything else. 

My mom eventually called me asking what happened. She seemed very confused so I figured my brother didn't tell her anything at all. I told her what happened and needless to say, it did not end well. She kept asking me to forgive my brother and take him back in. She ranted about how difficult it would be to support him and how what I'm doing is breaking the family apart. I let her talk till I eventually said my brother would no longer be welcome in my home. I told her that she needed to get him therapy and that until then, there's no chance we would ever see him. My mom told me she'd talk to my sister about it and I said... Good luck, she's mad at him too. 

Not sure what's going to happen to our family now. The reason why we got the big house was cause we wanted everyone to come over during the holidays and stay with us but Im not sure if my parents will at this point and there's no chance my brother is ever coming back anytime soon. Thankfully my sister is 100% on my side and we're going to talk about what we're doing for Thanksgiving soon. 

My wife hasnt really been the same either but she's getting better now that my brother is gone. We're talking about therapy which is something she's very willing to try out. We took a drive to the beach earlier (chill guys, we didn't leave the car) and talked about the future. We both agreed that after this whole covid thing is over, we're going to finally start our family with kids. We want two. Being a mom is something she always wanted but we both wanted to be financially secure enough to give them a good life and for us to also be in a position where we didn't have to work so much and just spend time with them. The sparkle in her eyes when we talked about our life together with kids told me that while things arent good right now, we're going to be ok. 

I honestly can't wait to be a dad myself. 

So yeah, long story short brother is gone, wife is still sad, sister is on my side but mom isn't and I'm going to be a dad in a few years. 

Thanks to everyone who gave me their advice. It honestly helped me clear my head and make the right decision to tell my wife first. 

Oh and to answer questions that may come up... 

No, we did not go to the police. My brother deleted everything voluntarily and left without a trace. I'm sure the pictures are still out there somewhere but thankfully they aren't too explicit that it would severely damage my wife's reputation. 

And no, we aren't going to try and get pregnant or anything like that. We plan on adopting which is something we both talked about early on. 

So again, thanks to everyone who messaged and commented. I may not have read everything nor have I replied to everyone but rest assured you are all greatly appreciated."

(i'm on mobile. i apologize for any mistakes)

Hi. First of all, I'd like to thank each and every one of you for your help. I'm really grateful for the support I've received here and all those little messages some of you sent me really made me understand the situation I was in. The many MANY comments I read here gave me the strength I needed to talk to my sister. Thank you, guys.

I should probably tell you that this might not be the perfect badass ending you all were expecting, and I apologize for that. I've always had a hard time standing up against my sister. Like I said in my original post, my boyfriend doesn't like confrontations either and he's also a huge people pleaser which makes this situation harder for both of us.  

Nevertheless, I finally decided to talk to my sister yesterday. She was actually sitting in my living room in her underwear and bra, and I completely lost my shit. I told her multiple times to wear some clothes but she said it was too hot which it was not. She then made a small comment about me being insecure about my bf liking her or something like that, and that made me angry.

I sat her down and we talked. I told her she was making me uncomfortable. She was making my boyfriend uncomfortable, and we wanted her to leave. She looked very shocked by it because I don't think I have ever talked to her like that. She immediately apologized though. She said she didn't know or some bullshit which I wasn't going to fall for this time.

I gave her an ultimatum. She needed to pack her shit and get out in three hours. She looked very emotional and she apologized a lot, said ""sorry"" a lot and told me she loved me. She said she would never intentionally try to hurt me. If I ""misunderstood"" her actions, it wasn't her fault. She kept saying she didn't know. She said she was just trying to be ""friendly"" to my boyfriend which is not true at all. 

I asked her if sexually harrassing someone was ""friendly"" to her, and she started crying. By this time, my bf who was in our bedroom (avoiding my sister and her skimpy clothing) came to support me. She kind of directed her questions towards him. She asked him if she was making him uncomfortable (He said yes) and she cried and apologized. She then tried to gain his sympathy by saying that I was kicking her out when she had no place to go. She also lied that I was always mean to her. She completely ignored me and asked him if she could stay. She had nowhere else to go.

Of course he said no. What the fuck did she think. I will forever remember the look on her face.

So yeah, she actually refused to leave, cried a lot and said she was jobless and she didn't have money, no place to stay, no friends etc. I told her she had no friends because she was a bitch (the first time I said something like this to my sister) She then tried to guilt trip me to let her stay by repeating the words ""I'm your sister"" ""family"" ""I love you"" etc. Me and my boyfriend helped her pack all her stuff and put it next to her car. I told her that she can stay in her car, I didn't care. I wanted her to go.

It wasn't really ""epic"" like some of you wanted. I was actually crying a little while I was shouting at her because I was shaking so much. At one point my bf had to tell me to calm down. It was just so overwhelming. I'm just glad she's gone.

She did leave eventually. She was calling someone and I'm pretty sure she went back to her own flat. Thank god she's not going to my parents because I don't think she knows how to quarantine. I know she won't quarantine and this was the main reason I was hesitant to kick her out.

2-3 hours after she left, my mom called me and yelled at me for kicking her out. I shouldn't have been shocked when she accused my bf of bothering my sister. My mom also asked me what kind of man I was dating, I should leave him etc. I should've expected that, really. I tried to reason with her but my mom was just angry at me. She asked me things like ""how can you do this to your own sister"" and similar bullshit she should be asking my sister. At that point I was so fucking angry. I was in tears and shaking. I just told her to fuck off in anger and hung up.

It was just a weird day. I'm proud of myself for finally standing up to my sister, but I also don't really feel like getting up from my bed. My bf is back to his cheerful self and I'm happy about that, but I just feel like such an idiot. I should've realized my mom would never take my side a long time ago.

I just don't understand what I did to make my mom so angry at me. Why doesn't she love me? I have done everything she asked me to do, but she never takes my side in things. I just want her to fucking love me and support me for once. It just never happens and I feel like I'm a fucking idiot for even trying. I think she regrets I was even born. 

Anyway fuck that. I'm done trying to reason with them. My mom will never believe me. Pretty sure my sister lied to her so mom keeps calling and trying to speak to my bf.

I'm currently thinking of cutting off all of my family. All they do is make me feel like shit. I deserve better than that. My boyfriend deserves better than that

I apologize for venting. What's done is done. I don't regret it. I'm glad I have my boyfriend and he loves me unlike my family and we finally have some alone time. He's been so moody, but right now he's actually cooking and stuff and he hasn't done that ever since sister came here so yeah. I'm glad she's gone. My boyfriend is glad she's gone. I finally have some peace and quiet in my home.  

Thank you so much to everyone. I don't think I can thank you all enough. Some of you talked to me, sent me messages and it really opened my eyes. I'll take care of myself and my boyfriend now. Thank you :)

Edit: thank you everyone. I've been reading your comments. I'm still shocked by the support I've received here. Please know that I appreciate it so much, even though I may not be able to reply. Thank you."

I decided to tell my boyfriend what happened. I told him last night, at 2AM. He was livid. I barely had time to finish the story before he started packing our bags. He kept on apologizing for the situation he put me in, and I could see how horrible he felt about all of this. He told me he wanted to talk to his parents about what they said and asked if I wanted to be a part of the conversation or if I’d rather wait in the car. Not being a person who likes confrontation at all, I hesitated but ultimately said I wanted to be there. I just didn’t want to actively participate in the conversation, I was too uncomfortable. 

He woke his parents up, sat them down and told them what I had heard. They were clearly extremely uncomfortable and kind of just stared at him, like they couldn’t believe he was doing this. He told them it was unacceptable and how ashamed he was of them. He also told them that when/if we would decide to speak to them again, they better be ready to sincerely apologize and do better, because he wouldn’t tolerate anything else. He also mentioned that their opinion would have no impact on who he would decide to marry. His mom looked like she wanted to say something but he didn’t let her, got up and we left. We were quite shaken up on the ride home, but he took the time to explain to me what he knew of why his parents behaved this way.

Basically, he remembers his parents making racist remarks here and there when he was little (not just about black people but POC in general). He didn’t really know it was wrong until he got out of his hometown and realized his parents were very wrong in their views. With time, he saw his parents less and less, because their views regarding race and other issues just didn’t align with his at all anymore and it would create animosity every time he visited them. When he met me, even before we became a couple and were just friends, he would often post pictures of us on Facebook and his parents would see them. They never mentioned anything. When they learned that we were a couple, they said they wanted to meet me, and he wasn’t sure of their sincerity. He said they talked about me when they would call him, and for a whole year, my bf basically tried to make sure that they were actually okay with our relationship. His parents kept saying not to worry, that they had learned from their past mistakes, asking him to trust them. After a year, he finally believed them and that’s when he decided to introduce us. He was so happy to see how nice and accepting they were towards me. He said it himself, he was too naive.

He was pretty much crying telling me this, but I could tell he tried not to because he felt responsible and didn’t want to make it about himself. Maybe it makes me dumb, but I don’t blame him. I know him, and he wouldn’t put me in a situation like that on purpose. I believe him when he says he truly thought they changed. He apologized numerous times and told me I never had to see them again, and that he wouldn’t either for a very long while. He was already not close with them, and this situation didn’t help at all. He made it a point to say that what his mother said about him wasn’t true (that he wouldn’t marry me because he knows they would disapprove). 

We talked about it a lot since last night. We barely slept. And I decided I do want to stay with him. A big majority of the comments under my last post told me that my best option was to leave him, a lot of it coming from POC. And I understand why. But, I do love him very much and I really do not want to leave him because his parents hate our relationship. I think I would regret it. I’m not saying it’ll be easy and maybe I am making a mistake, but I want to be with him. Maybe it’s disappointing to a lot of you, but it’s my decision.

*btw I didn’t contact daily mail, they published my post without asking me*

Thank you all very much for your advice. x"

So I found out he was cheating on me with an underaged girl.

Yesterday morning after confronted him and asked flat out if he cheated on me. He admitted that he had receive a blowjob from another woman. He said he blocked her on everything, but she kept creating instagram accounts to contact him. I asked why he hid this, and he said he was ashamed and was looking for the right time to say something. 

Something in my gut told me he still was lying, so I snuck into his room and stole his phone while he showered, he forgot to take my thumbprint out of his phone. I looked at his most recent texts, and a few hours before he had texted an unnamed number, “I told GF I was cheating on her, we might not be able to see each other for a while. If you need me message me on insta”. I have never been so hurt by anything in my life, I felt my heart drop as I read the text, I looked at past texts and saw pictures of his dick and her body and him saying she looked better than me. 

I moved on to his Instagram, and like a lot of people said, he had a second one he used to dm women. I found a conversation with the girl he had been talking to that started in August 2019, and suggested he had been fucking her since October 2019. For at least one year of our relationship he was unfaithful. I checked the girls profile to see if she was better looking than me, and saw in her bio the name of a high school near us and C/O 2023. My stomach turned and I had to stop myself from throwing up. He was fucking a 15 year old girl. At that point I had seen enough and decided to leave the apartment. I screenshoted everything and sent it to myself. I went to my friends place where showed her everything. 

I felt so disgusted and guilty. A bunch of the people that commented on my first post spoke about how he groomed me, and I just now am realizing how right they were. If I hadn’t let our relationship continue and told the other young girls what he did, it might’ve stopped him from doing it to other girls. I refuse to look back at his Instagram because I don’t want to know how many young girls I helped him either rape or abuse in some way. I feel so gross for defending him. I also feel disgusted by the fact that it’s very likely I performed oral sex on him hours after he had slipped his dick into a high schooler. That evening we began the process of reporting him and hopefully he will be thrown under the jail very soon. I’m going to try to do what I can to right the wrongs I did with this, and am planning to get an STI test and some therapy to get past this and raise my self esteem again.

Thanks for those of you that tried to help me."
hy4vqw,I (38m) just found out that my brother (19m) has been perving on my wife (37f),34491,0.95,3403,2020-07-26 16:11:47,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hy4vqw/i_38m_just_found_out_that_my_brother_19m_has_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hy4vqw/i_38m_just_found_out_that_my_brother_19m_has_been/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway cause I'm still the only one that knows 

Background: My brother has been staying with us since lockdown, after his University closed. He couldn't stay with our parents cause they just sold the house and moved to a 1 bedroom apartment and our sister lives in a different part of the country. He was the ""oops"" baby so I hope that explains the age gap. My wife and I have a 5 bedroom home but currently don't have children yet (we decided to adopt 2 kids in our 40s) so we let him stay here. 

My brother has always been... Different. He's a bit of a loner and doesn't have a lot of friends outside of his online group. He's a shy geeky kid but he's otherwise alright (or so I thought) when you get to know him.

So here's what happened

The wifi doesn't quite reach my brother's room so he usually does his school work and other stuff in the dining room. A few nights ago, I was walking to the fridge after waking up in the middle of the night (wife and I sleep early) and saw my brother working on something out and as I got closer, I saw a very compromising picture of my wife (cleavage shot as she was gardening). He noticed me and quickly closed the window like he was watching porn. I was too shell shocked to say anything at that time and he just smiled awkwardly and ran to his room with the laptop. 

When I realized that something was up, I knew I had to find out. The next day, I asked my brother to pick up some groceries and some lunch for us and while he was away, I went to his room (something I've never done since he moved) and, well, it wasn't pretty. I saw a couple of my wife's bras and some of her panties which I can only assume he used to pleasure himself. I took his laptop and fuck it, decided to snoop. I knew his password cause I borrowed his Crunchyroll account to watch this anime my friend recommended (I don't usually watch anime). 

There I saw some of the most sickening entries I've read. There were pictures of my wife in a towel, her working out, her in compromising positions, etc. All taken without her consent by the looks of it. The fucker even logs every time he touches himself to the image of my wife. The creepiest part? He sometimes listens in on us when we have sex. My wife can be a bit loud but we didn't think it would be a problem since his bedroom was in a different part of the house (guest bedroom). 

I left the room feeling like I needed a shower. It was absolutely disgusting. 

Now I don't know what to do. I find myself fighting the urge to pummel him into next week every time I see him. I haven't told my wife yet cause I'm 100% sure she will feel violated and disgusted so I want to find the best solution first before doing so. I so desperately want to kick him out but I he has nowhere else to go. Even if I do, what should I tell my parents? The truth? This will most likely break the family apart. I do plan on telling my wife soon but if I do, I can almost guarantee she would want nothing to do with him and would never want to visit the family if he's around. 

I'm so fucking lost right now. Any advice will help. Still fighting the urge to beat my brother to a bloody pulp.

Edit: if you're wondering, I did take pictures as proof.

Small update: I told my wife. The redditors who said I should tell her first before anything cause she was the victim were absolutely right. I'm giving her all the power to decide what to do about it. A lot has happened but there are still things that need to be settled. Too long to add here and too incomplete to make a new update post. Hopefully we'll have everything settled tomorrow or the day after. I'll write the update once everything is settled and I calmed down. 

No, I'm not going to beat up my brother but I have thought about it. 

And to the people asking for the pics... You're disgusting. Hope the women in your life are proud of you. That's my wife, please have some respect."

We have been dating for about a year. I work as a high-level engineer at a good firm and my girlfriend works as a payroll specialist at a good firm too. I make significantly more than her (3x).

Things were good in our relationship until I showed her my retirement/savings. She now doesn't see the point of working and has started framing our relationship in that, she is the beautiful one and that I am the nerdy engineer that was lucky to have her. Before, when we met she was all about making it her own way, eventually starting her own company with her sister in sourcing and recruiting. But now she jokes about driving a Range Rover and wearing Lululemon and going to Yoga.

We were having a discussion again about this 'trophy wife' stuff she brought up that I was nerdy back in the day while she was very popular. I told her she is not a trophy wife, that yes she is attractive but its not a huge difference between us.

I told her had it been the case that I met her when she was 22 and I was my current age than sure, but she isn't 22 anymore. After I said that she just started crying like crazy.

She started saying that I think of her as ugly and used up that her best years are behind are. She just told me that if I am not happy to be with her, why am I even here? to stop wasting her time.

I tried to talk to her but she was in no state for a conversation. I don't know what to say, guys, for me, I just wanted to say that I think we are of similar attractiveness. Like I don't think anyone when they see us turns their head and is like oh she is with him the cause of money? Or damn he is so lucky to be with her. I think it's mutual. She was the one that if anything went after my attractiveness first.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I like the fact that we both work and I don't want to change that dynamic. And I don't want her to think too that she is above me that I am so lucky to have her. I want her to think of us as equals and in my attempt to do that I hurt her feelings. What's the next move?

&#x200B;

**Tl;Dr- ever since my girlfriend found out about my savings she has more often entertained the idea of being a stay at home wife. She has tried to bring up the fact that she was more attractive than me as justification why I am so lucky to be with her and why I should accept this.**"

Thank you all for staying patient. Also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

First off I just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. I’m still trying to work through all of your PM’s because I’d like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. I have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. I never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it’s my hope that if I can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice I used from Reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon CP and find this thread (at least in Canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

I also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, I understand. This is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as I wish I had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary Karma, I don’t. To provide proof I have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what I have written.

Yesterday I was picked up by my best friend Alex around 2:30. We drove around and talked for a while. I went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. We drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

Alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. David was home, in my room, and immediately I noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. He said he had to admit something to me. I prepared for him to admit to possessing CP but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn’t know how to bring it up. I feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. He  said no. I asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. I don’t know why I was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the CP but I really thought he’d admit to it then and there. Instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn’t think he would act on it. He asked me if that changed my perception of him and I said no. He grew quiet again and I left to go shower. When I came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. It was about 1030 at this point. When he left, I finally lost it and broke down. I grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. I was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

I grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency RCMP line for my city. Shaking and crying I explained to the lady on the phone that I had discovered CP on my boyfriend’s phone. She put me through to the report line and I spoke to another Constable who told me I would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. I waited for around 10 minutes. The officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. I asked if I could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, Crown Counsel has clear evidence that I was not coerced into stating what I witnessed. I don’t have my full licence yet and because of the late time I wasn’t able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if David was there and if I could safely leave without arousing suspicion. Luckily David knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so I made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. David didn’t seem to question it and I waited for the officer to arrive. 

He called me from a blocked number and I walked outside and down the block to his SUV. The constable and another officer greeted me,  I got into the front seat and we drove to the station. During the ride I asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. He explained that I had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying David. He said if I had taken David’s phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. It was about 11:15 at this point. They placed me in an interview room and I sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. The officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. He said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 He started off by asking me details about my life, where I grew up, past employment etc. After that portion he asked me about David, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else I knew about him. I told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we’d been together but I did express that things had been moving very quickly. He agreed. He then got me to explain how I came upon the photos in question, so I did. Then came the worst part. He asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos I explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. It was intense but by some grace of God I was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and I was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. He asked me if I would testify in court and I said I would. The officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. The full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

After I had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. They explained how the process would go and whether I wanted a no contact agreement.  I said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. That made sense to me so I chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

We got in the constable’s car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. I told them I was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (I didn’t want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. I’ve never felt so anxious in my life. I asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. About 15 minutes later I saw them bringing David out in handcuffs. My heart which had been dissolving in my stomach’s acid all day felt completely gone. I curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told I could go back inside. After another eternity (my phone had died by this point but I know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. I was told by the officer I could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. The officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that I did a brave thing and to be well. 

I went back into my house, put Planet Earth on for background noise and called my other best friend Paige who had been keeping up with me about this since I sent her my reddit post. We were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. It was David. He was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. My jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and I was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. Paige asked me if everything was okay and I told her David had walked through the door, I would call her back. Immediately David came to the bed where I was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. He said he didn’t know I would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. He asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. I lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. He sobbed more and loudly said “That isn’t me, that isn’t me, this isn’t who I am” and cried more and more. His body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. It was immensely difficult to witness and I wish I could have told him to get the fuck out but I just sat there immobilized, in shock. It was well close to 5 in the morning and I hadn’t slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

David began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. I asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. He said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. I asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. He said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. I nodded. I asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. He admitted they were very explicit photos and I asked how he even found them; I don’t recall we ever got to that. He promised me he didn’t use my internet to access it but I don’t really believe that. He apologized to me more times than I could count and asked if I hated him. I told him I wasn’t sure that I felt hatred for him but I was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; I told him how terribly I felt betrayed and hurt and violated. I expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

Then I heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. Three officers were outside, two of whom I recognized from earlier and they asked me if David was here. I said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because Paige had called in. I realized I had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know I was okay, bless her heart. The officers took David outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. I told them I was okay; that I would finish my discussion with him and if I had any issues I had them on speed dial. They nodded and left. 

David sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and I just sat and well, endured it. Tears just ran and ran and ran from him. He said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure I expected to hear this great big apology. He said if I thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he’d done, but what I had to go through. I just nodded. There was silence for a long time, I think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. I don’t know how long I stared at my TV screen that said “Are you still watching: Planet Earth?” but it could have been a lifetime. I had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. I think David was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. I didn’t know or care, I was just numb. I would have probably sat like that until I died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. I got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. My brain wasn’t capable of thought so I stared at my tv screen until I passed out sometime around 9. 

I didn’t sleep for long because when I woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. David was awake and crying still. When he realized I was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. I just stared at him. He started apologizing and apologizing more. He expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that I was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. He expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. I shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. At this point I finally asked him to leave. I told him I needed space to sort out my emotions, and I needed to get some sleep.  I asked him if he would be okay. He nodded and grabbed his things. He said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that’s what I wanted him to do. I said nothing. He expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. He said I love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

I’ve been laying in bed since then and writing this. I just want this to be over. I just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. Also I think I forgot to add that his court date is set for June. As far as sentencing, if he’s found guilty of possession of child pornography I believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  I will post updates again if I feel  they are important; otherwise I will update again in June when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

Thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. I have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and I would have been so lost without some of your advice. I’ll continue working on replying to your PM’s, but in the meantime I think I’m going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

TLDR: Filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested David and seized his phone. He signed a promise to appear in court in June. He awaits sentencing.

In January this year, we both together decided to save money every month for our wedding and honeymoon. In 6 months, we saved around $8000. Last month, my fiancé's bestfriend bought a new gaming pc, so even my fiancé wanted to buy one, so he asked me, but I denied it because we both already had laptops. I told him that he can play games in the laptop that he already has. He repeatedly kept asking me if he could buy a pc and I finally agreed to it (now I regret it so badly).

 After a week, the pc finally came and with the pc, a new table and chair also was delivered. Apparently he had ordered a gaming chair and a table as well. That night, I asked him how much it all cost and he was a little hesitant to tell me. After a while he told me and I was distraught when I heard that he had spent our entire savings of $8000 to buy the pc. We had a very big argument that night and I scolded him for spending all our savings because that savings contained not only his money but my money as well. And we were saving it for our wedding. After everything I told him, his final reply was ""I will earn it all back soon"". I don't trust those words at all. 

 I thought anything worse than this couldn't happen at this moment, but it has. It has been about 2 weeks since he got the pc and since then, my finacé hasn't gotten up from his new chair. Ever since he got the pc, he hasn't even seen my face. The only time he talks to me is when he is hungry, he calls to me and tells me to get him something to eat/drink. I call him to watch TV and he denies it saying that he's busy. I call him to sleep together and he denies it and says that he'll sleep later. His sleep schedule has been fucked. He plays games the whole night and sleeps as 5am and wakes up at 2pm. He's asleep when I'm awake and he's awake when I'm asleep. From the past 2 weeks I've been so lonely that it feels like I'm alone at home and nobody to even talk to. He is ignoring me so much that I think he has absolutely forgotten that I even exist in his life. I honestly feel like his waitress now a days because from the past 2 weeks, the only interaction we both have is him asking for food and water and me giving it to him.

He has also 100% stopped doing all the house chores. From the past 2 weeks, I have been the one doing all the house chores and it's getting very hard for me to do it all alone. We used to share our responsibilities and do all the house chores together, but from the past 2 weeks, he isn't even taking care of himself. He is barely even brushing his teeth and taking a bath, let alone do the house chores. Also he is actually supposed to be working from home, but ever since the pc arrived, he hasn't even touched his laptop to work and he's isn't even seeing his phone to check if someone has called/text him anything regarding work. I'm now genuinely afraid that he might lose his job.

Everything that is happening right now is so bad, I called my parents and told them about it last night and they almost had nothing to say. I'm thinking of calling his parents tonight and telling it to them, and maybe they can knock some sense into him. I honestly don't know what else to do now. I want to burn that pc. It would be very nice if someone suggested me something about this. Thank you very much for reading this and thank you very much in advance for your comments and suggestions.

Tl;dr : My finacé spent all the money that we were saving for our wedding to buy a gaming pc and now all he does the whole day is play video games. He has totally ignored me and he has forgotten that I even exist in the house. He has also stopped doing all the house chores and has also totally ignored his work that he was supposed to do from home."

She was significantly bigger than girls I normally date. But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I’d give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That’s very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don’t know.

So I explain to her that I’m actually waiting for someone and I don’t want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That’s when she springs it on me that she’s actually the one I’m waiting for. She told me how she’s lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here’s the thing, I don’t know how I feel about being “tested”. I don’t want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she’s also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I’m not sure how I should proceed.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to be downvoted so much. I guess people just prefer the standard “I just walked in on my fiancé and my father, brother, and best friend all had their penis’ inside her at the same time. Should I still go through with the wedding?”"

Thanks for all the help I got in my last post. As much as it pained me to do so I decided to do the right thing. Pam should know that my brother is cheating on her. 

I decided to give Jim a chance. I called him and told him that, I can’t keep this secret. It was tearing me up inside to do so. I couldn’t think about anything else. I told him I loved him so much but I couldn’t let him do this to someone else I loved like family. He begged me to reconsider. He didn’t try to guilt me or anything. But he did say that he needs his younger brother to just be there for him. I told him I couldn’t. I asked him what he would want if it was me getting cheated on, or our little sister getting cheated. He said that he understood that it’s wrong but he was just exploring himself. I told him that thats no excuse. I told him, that he had until that evening to tell Pam, and if he didn’t I would have to. We then hung up and I just waited. 

At 11pm I called Pam and stuck up a normal conversation. I asked her how things were with my brother, she said it was all fine and that, they’re thinking about having kids. I really couldn’t believe my brother made me do this but I had to tell her. I told her that what I saw. She was livid she refused to believe me. Luckily I was able to show her the screenshot of my brother being in someone else’s bed. She then told me she needed to hang up. 

I haven’t heard anything from my brother. But as of today, Pam is leaving him. So I guess that’s good, she won’t have to be hurt by him like that, and I can be there for her. My brother hasn’t answered any of my calls or texts, so I don’t know when we’ll talk again.

At least I still have Pam and my sister I guess."

You can find it on my profile.

First of all, thanks to everyone. While there were some rather unpleasant responses (like the guy who called me a pussy for being upset or the woman who messaged me to say that if I couldn’t satisfy my girlfriend I should let better men do so because she deserved it) the overwhelming majority were kind and sympathetic. I couldn’t respond to most because there were so many but I assure you, you are appreciated.

I talked to my landlord who was sympathetic and offered me another apartment if I continued paying my lease. It’s an informal arrangement where I’m still legally residing and paying for my old apartment but staying in another. 

As expected, my now former friends took my old roommates side and I’ve cut them out of my life. 

I’m not doing the best I could be mentally. I’m all alone and dealing with personal insecurities, loneliness and heartbreak. Still, at least I’m out of my earlier situation. I’ve taken a week off work and arranged to see a therapist. 

All in all, my situation isn’t great but it’s unlikely to get worse and I’m working on improving it.

EDIT: I have been completely overwhelmed by the response to this. I have literally hundreds of messages of support and lots of comments urging me to stay strong. There is no possible way I can respond to all of them so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. You’re all amazing!"

It’s been 5 years and my family think I should be over it already.,32713,0.92,1411,2020-08-25 20:17:28,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/igdkyo/my_28f_stepsister_29f_slept_with_my_exfiancé_37m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/igdkyo/my_28f_stepsister_29f_slept_with_my_exfiancé_37m/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I changed some minor details for the sake of remaining anonymous. Also, sorry this is so long once I started writing I found it cathartic and couldn’t stop word vomiting all over the post. TL;DR at the bottom!

When I was 23 (now 28), I was engaged to Ryan (was 32, now 37). Our engagement ended when my stepsister Kelly (was 24, now 29) begged me to leave him because they loved each other but Ryan was too afraid to break up with because he didn’t want to hurt me/my family. When I confronted Ryan about it, he denied it, said she had been trying to come on to him for some time and he never mentioned it because he didn’t want to ruin our relationship. He begged me not to believe her and so we continued how we were. Kelly grew resentful and made nasty comments about how I was forcing a man who didn’t even love me to marry me because I had low self-esteem constantly. A month later, she sent me a video of them having sex in my bed and multiple screenshots of him telling her he loved her, how he wished she was the girl he was marrying, how he hated that I wouldn’t let them be together. I was devastated and angry, but my best friend convinced me not to go nuclear on them and instead to quietly move out when Ryan was at work the next week. So that’s what I did. I contacted my dad and my stepmom and asked them if I could move in temporarily. I removed the money I had contributed into our joint account for wedding expenses and transferred the rest to him before closing the account. Once I got settled in, I sent all of the screenshots she sent me to all of our relatives and his. 

Ryan tried to get back together with me multiple times, but I ended up blocking him when I found out he had proposed to her with the same ring he gave me (I left it behind). Now Kelly is my stepsister from my mom’s side. I have another stepsister (36) and stepbrother (38) from my mom’s second marriage and a half-sister (26). They all went to the wedding. Whenever I tried to express I was hurt by the fact they were just supporting Kelly/Ryan as though what they did to me meant nothing they would shrug it off and say they couldn’t cut them out completely because they were family. I haven’t spent a single holiday with my mom’s side since, neither has my older biological brother or sister. I only see my mom and half-sister when I invite them over to my place as Kelly/Ryan moved in with my mom and my stepdad a year after they got married. Our relationship is very rocky, but I’ve grown closer to my dad/stepmom and their children (an older stepbrother and two younger half-siblings), who have all been very supportive since this all happened, so it’s not all been bad.

On new years day my boyfriend (now husband) proposed to me. We had a small engagement party which I invited my mom and half-sister too. They never turned up because I was “excluding half of our family”. I never invited my stepdad or stepsiblings because they were pretty hurtful when it came out that Kelly/Ryan were sleeping together. They claimed it wasn’t their fault I got in the way of “true love” and made me out to be some sort of vindictive Disney villain for being angry with them. We were planning to have our wedding ceremony this summer, but in late February my husband suggested we postponed until next year because he was concerned COVID would get worse and we would have to cancel/reschedule anyway. I ended up finding out I was pregnant a month before our original wedding date, so we had a courthouse wedding on that date with the plan to hold the ceremony next year. Only my dad’s side of the family were aware of both the pregnancy and the wedding.

My stepmom likes to knit so she’s been making some stuff for the baby. Recently, she posted about the things she had made on facebook with a caption talking about how excited she was to have another grandchild soon. I was tagged in the post. I have zero issues with the post. I never told my family I wasn’t going to inform my mom’s side, it wasn’t that I intentionally hid it from her she just never seemed very interested in my life/relationship so I never brought it up.

My mom called me an hour later to demand to know if I was pregnant and how she couldn’t believe I hadn’t told her she was finally going to be a grandmother. She has since invited me and my husband over to her house multiple times, I’ve declined every single time for the obvious reason. My stepdad, who I’ve barely spoken to in 5 years has reached out to tell me how excited he is to meet the baby and my husband, same with my siblings. Even Kelly reached out to my husband to congratulate us. I was furious. 

The next time my mom and stepdad called me I finally laid into them. I told them I didn’t want them to keep inviting me over when they knew I would be forced to see Kelly/Ryan if I came, I told them how hurt and angry I still am over what they did to me and how my ‘family’ dismissed my feelings, I told them how they wouldn’t throw Kelly/Ryan away but they were so quick to leave me out to rot whilst I was going through the worst betrayal I’d ever experienced in my life, I told them I wasn’t even sure I wanted people like them in my child’s life. 

My mom was crying hysterically and kept saying I was being cruel, and I couldn’t deprive her of her first grandchild. The thing is, my baby ISN’T her first grandchild, my sister has two adopted daughters already who my mom doesn’t even try to bond with. She kept wailing about how I might be the only person in our family to even give her grandchildren (my stepsisters are both having a hard time getting/staying pregnant and my half-sister has proclaimed herself to be child free). 

My stepdad got angry and defensive. He claimed I was petty for holding onto something that happened 5 years ago. He pointed out how I had found someone else so I should understand how love works and sometimes two people just can’t help themselves. You love who you love, basically. He said Kelly/Ryan were happy together, so I should be happy for them the way they’re happy for me and my husband. The ironic thing is my sister told me Kelly/Ryan looked like they were on the verge of divorce and they argue constantly (my mom complains to her about them) and how my siblings all hate him but pretend they like him for Kelly’s sake. 

I ended up hanging up because I was so angry and when I get angry, I start crying, I didn’t want them to think they got to me. 

Since, I’ve been receiving texts and calls nonstop from my mom’s family. They’re all essentially telling me I should be over things already. It’s gotten to the point me and my husband have switched phones so he can screen my messages for me, and I don’t have to read them.

TL;DR – My stepsister slept with my ex- fiancé and married him. I’m now happily married to someone else and we’re expecting our first child together. My family thinks I should be over it already since I’ve moved on, but the anger is still there, and I have no interest in forming a relationship with my ex or my stepsister again. They’re now putting pressure on me to try and get me to forget it ever happened.  

How do I make my family understand just how unforgiveable what Kelly/Ryan have done to me is? I would prefer not to go completely no contact but is that my only option here?"

&#x200B;

Super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

I wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love I received from people in this sub I feel like the least I can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. Before I begin I just want to thank everyone who gave advice, I didn't respond to everyone but I read almost every response. I stopped reading my Pm's because a lot of the messages I was getting were graphic and negative but I appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you. Now on to the update: 

It's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. My bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time I decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. I felt like everything I needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. His sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

We spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. He told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while I was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when I first suggested it. He said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (I don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when I brought up his tattoo. Obviously I knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but I must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because I never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

I was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. He regrets the tattoo and discovering I wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. Truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. He apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. He completely understood where I was coming from when I brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

I apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. Initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what I meant and was very forgiving. He apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

We then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

Up until now I was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. Not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. Apparently she felt like I was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

If that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. Not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. We're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

My bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. She was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. We've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

In the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. In the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. Bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. I'm a fan of this idea as well. 

As for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. I don't think he should, I feel like he's lost enough family but I'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

I think that just about wraps everything up. A huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

I mean this in the nicest way possible when I say I hope I never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - We both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. Boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. We're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable."
ibmiwf,(UPDATE) My stepfather killed my mother and then killed himself.

Hello, I guess in some way I wanted to give you people an update on what has been going on with me. When I posted my first post, I was slightly drunk, it was the night the police showed up at my house and rang the doorbell and I was confused. All of your messages, messages from random strangers, helped me in some way. I’d like to thank whoever sent me that poem by Mary Elizabeth Frye - Do not stand at my grave and weep, we used that for the invitation to her party. And also Bianca who painted that beautiful painting of her which she sent me by email. Thank you. 

Also, fair warning, this might be quite a long post, this might trigger someone and I’ve been writing this post over several days as more information keeps trickling in and the picture of that night is becoming clearer and clearer. I think I'm also mainly writing this for myself.

What happened that night (the 22nd of July) is just still so surreal.

I'm sitting at my mothers desk right now, in her little office in our apartment that I grew up in, in Berlin. Her presence in some way is all around me. It has been 23 days since the police showed up in front of my door at 3 in the morning and asked if they could come in. Since my stepfather hung himself. Everything has been so confusing

It's all sort of a mixture between crying, screaming, yelling, throwing things, and just emptiness. I go through phases (someone linked that famous post about grief and god it's so accurate) and it's really hard to cope. Since that night I haven't ever actually been alone. This is somewhat exhausting to me in some ways but probably also very important. 

I’m going to go through the series of events and facts because I also want to set it right, since in the media (since some of you found the articles online and connected the dots) there is so much false information, it’s hard to believe. 

My Mother and my stepfather were together for 8 years and he has only been living in Berlin since then. He has children from his previous marriage, that is all I will say. I am my mothers only daughter. 

He did not call me and confess to what he did (as many report) but he called some vaguely mutual friend who he walks his dog with sometimes. This was some time after 11 PM. At this point he was already up at the summer house. It takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get up there. This means my mother had been dead for about 2 hours (it says so in the police report as well). 

The summer house did not belong to my stepdad, but to my mom. She poured all of the little money she had and renovated it by hand. It does not in any way belong to him. 

The police showed up at my moms and my apartment late at night, they didn’t know the address of where he might have gone and were also worried he might come and harm me since he had the keys to our apartment as well. I was watching a movie with a friend of mine. 

I posted on reddit a few hours later, the news articles started coming out the next day, connecting my stepfather to a celebrity. I posted because I needed help. 

This celebrity and my stepfather are by no means „friends“ they are acquaintances and there is no reason for him to be brought into any of this.

That was wednesday night/thursday morning. On friday I was at the LKA (criminal police) and gave a 3 hour statement about them and their relationship.

***(This next part is about my feelings and mainly about my mom, feel free to skip it)***

Since then my whole world has been turned upside down. My mother, the person I honestly loved most in the whole world was just torn from me. It feels like I have this big bleeding hole inside of me. I’m not crying all the time, sometimes I feel ok, but more like empty. 

My mother has been with me my whole life, the whole 21 years and I’m not just saying this because she is dead, she is honestly the best mother you could wish for. She is goofy and caring, her laugh is infectious, she has such integrity. She is the most animated person, when she tells a story she will get up from the table and gesture all around. Her eyes are so shining. I think I might show some pictures of her, because I want people to recognise her beauty. I want the whole world to know she is gone. Because this is an honest and devastating loss to the world, believe me. 

She is so talented. She got her bachelor in Art History in America, she has worked odd jobs all her life. She’s always been a hippie. When I was little she started working at this English-language summer camp in Thüringen in Germany and she used to take me there for many weeks with her, on a hill, on a farm in the middle of a giant forest. 

She’s a magician in the kitchen, she can open the fridge door and magically make something out of leftover ingredients that nobody would ever think tastes good (noodles and carrots anyone?). 

She likes to make everything herself. She would let milk go bad and make her own ricotta, I have a thousand jars of her homemade chutneys and jams. She baked her own bread years before the pandemic. She made her own vinegar, her own syrups and alcohol and her hot sauces are legendary. I used to come home and open the fridge door and I’d ask her which of the many bowls she had covered with little plates were edible, and which weren’t ready yet. 

Since she’s dead I have found so many started experiments of things I don’t even know what they are. I wish I could ask her. There are so many things I wish I had the time to ask her. Writing this is making me cry again. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, March I believe, I moved back in with her and she ordered 14 different bottles of white wine on Lidl and every night we’d drink one together while we cooked and I’d write notes on the color and the taste and we’d give it a 1-10 on the Lidl scale.

She’s one of the funniest people I know. And she is so forgiving. Even when I was younger we would get into huge blow up fights sometimes and we’d scream. But five minutes afterwards she’d come into my room and she’d apologise and tell me she loved me more than anything in the world. 

We told each other we loved one another all the time, sometimes just randomly and hug each other. I’m so so grateful for this.

I would say we had a rare mother-daughter bond. I love her with all my heart, she has always been my idol, my role-model. If I’m even half the person she is, as generous, hilarious, creative, emotional, forgiving and understanding, I will be lucky. I see her face in front of me all the time. I can hear her laugh. 

Fuck, I’d really give anything for her to be with me right now. Anything. It really tears me apart. 

If it weren’t for her, I would have probably been dead 1 1/2 years ago. She pulled me out of my dark holes, she loved me unconditionally. She isn’t just my mother, she is my best friend. And I will never ever forgive him for taking her from me. Especially since more and more facts are coming out. 

***(End of emotional bit)*** 

It’s important to preface that I knew their relationship, or to be more exact, I was the closest to both of them together. And it’s important to understand that he wasn’t some creepy, abusive, scary bad guy. 

I loved him. He was like a best friend to me. When he came into my mothers and my life, I took him in with open arms. I’ve confided in him, I’ve told him secrets, we’ve had running jokes. We made bets with each other that I usually won and he had to pay up. He was my family. 

This makes me feel just as conned. I feel cheated. I feel like I’ve been blind. I’ve had bad fights with him as well and I knew about their fights but I didn’t see this coming, not even a little bit. 

I would never put my mother in harms way. I guess this is why she must have kept things hidden from me. 

The murder happened in his apartment (they had separate apartments) and afterwards he drove his car up to my mothers country house that they both spent every weekend at. Hunting mushrooms, planting and building things, going swimming in the lake thats right in front of the door. This was their refuge and I’m assuming this is the reason he went there. 

Since the day this has happened I’ve always assumed he blew up about something, lost control and he killed my mother while he wasn’t clear headed. This is what made sense to me. That he killed himself because he killed my mother. Because he didn’t know how to continue. 

But the more time goes by and the more facts we uncover (we being my mothers friends and I, not the police), the more it seems it was the opposite. 

That he killed my mother because he wanted to kill himself. And that he was covering something up. 

Since the night the police showed up, they’ve been asking me if I could know where their laptops are, they both had a laptop. And both are missing. They found the empty cases, but they’re gone. 

This sparked suspicion in us. His phone is gone as well, my mothers is not, the police gave it to me. Then there are the other facts. (TRIGGER WARNING) Despite what it said in the media, she didn’t have multiple stab wounds in her chest. There was only one very precise and very small wound that caused her death. He only let someone know what he did after he was up at the house. When he arrived at the cabin, he apparently parked normally, even greeted one of the neighbours.

The pieces are falling into place. That this was cold blooded.

I don’t really know why I’m writing all this down in a word document and why I’m going to post it on reddit, but I need to share. 

I feel so much hatred and so much anger. I feel it boiling underneath my skin and it keeps threatening to come out. I’ve smashed so much stuff, I’ve gotten so angry. Sometimes I snap and I scream at people and other times I just cry and beat my pillows. And sometimes I’m very calm. I can still feel joy. And my mother has this amazing circle of friends that I’ve known my whole life and who are supporting me. I saw her body in the coffin and I will never be able to get that image out of my head. She was so tiny, it breaks my heart. 

I’ve also slept two nights at the cabin and in the dark every shadow looked like my stepfather. I’ve become scared and started locking my doors at night. Murder used to seem something so far off, something that happened to other people, in a different world, separate from mine. But now it’s not. And I won’t let him spoil her place, her house. I won’t let him take that away from her and from me. I refuse. 

I just miss her. I miss everything about her. It hasn’t been that long yet and all I want is for her to hug me and say my name and say she loves me and that she thinks I’m an amazing young woman. I want her to cuddle with me in bed which she did for so many years until I felt myself too old. 

I want to sit at the kitchen table in the morning with her and have her ask me what I dreamt about last night and have both of us talk about our dreams. For her to talk with me about my story ideas and my poetry and to talk with her about the book that she was writing and will never finish. 

It just hurts so much, I don’t know how to ever get past this. She has always been the most amazing person I know and I can’t get over this. I don’t know how to get over this. I feel lost. I feel like I have to grow up very fast now and carry her with me. 

Theres so much more to tell. So much. But I should probably stop somewhere. I would appreciate all advice. 

Thank you for reading.

First of all, thank you so much for the support on my first post. I did not expect it to gain that much attention. I guess a lot happened since then? I don't know if it's even been a week yet. But this is going to change my life, perhaps for the better.

There were hundreds of comments, and I'd thought I'd address a few questions regarding the rape itself. I don't appreciate how some of these were asked, but I'll share anyway for the sake of clarifying things.

1. Was I under the influence? Yes, but I remember vividly saying no. I was drunk enough to have all my strength and mobility wonky but I didn't black out or anything. The force he used on me didn't seem that of someone who was drunk, he looked completely sober, but I could be wrong. I remember a couple of times when I was trying to lift myself off the bed and he would push me back down, I remember the expression on his face. Like you guys said, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.That's all I'm willing to share for now, the only person who knows all the details is Tina. Is it bad that I wish she knew nothing now? Maybe it would hurt less.

2. Why didn't I report it? Because I saw how that turned out for other girls I knew. I've had a few other friends (not Tina) who have had the same thing happen to them and nothing came out of reporting it, and it made them feel worse. Just the few comments calling me a liar stung, so I can't imagine how I would have felt back as my unstable teen self. Not only that, I was scared of what Rod would do if he found out I had reported him. There was just something about him that made me never want to cross him.

Reading all your comments, it seems pretty clear that how Tina was treating me was extremely inconsiderate and I should find a new friend. Although it was a huge slap in the face, I came to my senses and believed that I couldn't be around someone who would do that to me. Some of you said to expose them during vows, but that's just not the kind of person I am, and it might not turn out well. A few of you gave me example texts I could send which I am extremely thankful for, but I decided to send this.

""I've had time to think about it, and I just can't be your maid of honor anymore. It's so hurtful that you are telling me to pack up my trauma for who knows how long until your wedding day.I just can't do it. I don't think I will come at all knowing that he's going to be there. I'm sorry.""

It's pretty weak, but it's probably the ""meanest"" text I've ever sent. An hour later, I get a call from Josh. He asked me what was going on with me and Tina, and that she was extremely upset. A part of me snapped and I said ""I don't know, what's going on with you making someone who raped me best man?"" I don't usually blurt things out like that. He was confused and I repeated myself. He was silent for a few seconds and then asked if he could come over. I was a little wary of the idea but I said sure.(I know, we should be social distancing but this really needed to be discussed.)

He comes to my apartment 40 minutes later without Tina. I have never hung out with Josh one on one before, it was always with Tina. Josh always had a really cute and sweet personality, and I've always approved of him when it came to dating her. He was really only a friendly acquaintance to me though.

We sat down and spoke for over an hour.

Tina had told Josh that the reason I wasn't coming to the wedding was that I didn't want to work with Rod...BECAUSE I HAD A CRUSH ON HIM...and thought she was forcing the relationship too much. So basically, she said we had a petty girl fight. My jaw hit the floor and I was fuming. She had obviously never told Josh what Rod did to me. I shared that Rod had raped me back in high school, and that Tina knew about it. I asked if he knew too.

He said he didn't, but at one point Rod did mention that a few ""crazy bitches"" falsely accused him of rape senior year. This obviously didn't include me, since I only told Tina and a few family members.. Josh believed him at the time, but I guess after hearing ME say it it's starting to dawn on him that his friend was a liar.

Here's something that I didn't expect...Josh shared with me that he was raped when he was a kid by an older brother of a friend he had. He said that if he was forced to work with said brother on a wedding, he would absolutely refuse. He apologized heavily on behalf of Tina, but I won't forgive unless she says it herself. 

I know some of you may think Josh is lying, but I believe him. 

I could see it by Josh's face and body language that the realization really weighed down on him, and I felt bad. In a way, we were both going through a betrayal. I asked if he was ok to go home, and he said yes. He thanked me for telling him and left. I don't know if I'll stay in touch with him, but I was beyond furious with Tina at this point. 

I was expecting an angry text coming from her, and sure enough, I got it at like midnight. She went off saying that I'm gonna end up destroying their marriage, how could I do that to her, etc etc. I just pressed the block button and went to bed. Quickest decision ever made.

I'm feeling a little down in the dumps right now, yet slightly relieved. I'm going to try to connect with other friends and try to move on from this. If I'm feeling brave enough, I might try to find these ""crazy bitches"" and see if we can make a case against Rod. Knowing that there are other victims makes me feel so guilty I want to scream. Sorry it's not too happy of an ending, but I think it might have been more unhappy if I decided to go along with it. Thank you Reddit."

I don't condone hitting a womann and if i could go back I would. What's done is done and now my family is in turmoil.

So my aunty and uncle came to my house to talk to my parents. I though this was stupid because of Covid but they went ahead and came anyway. They brought my cousin who we will call Carly.

Me and Carly get along fine but yesterday we did not. We started to argue about about a game system. It was a stupid argument of who got the good controller and bad controller. Everything went down hill when I would not give her the good one (It's my system).

She tried to take the remote from me, but in the process slapped me across the face with her nails. I started bleeding so I got up and walked to the bathroom. I don't know if she had an adrenalin rush, but all I here is ""MY NAILS!"". She grabs me and punched me in the face. In the heat of the moment, I punched her in the stomach and she fell over screaming.

Her dad comes up the stairs and without asking any questions b-lines towards me. He grabs me, then my dad came and grabbed him before he could hit me. Him and my dad were yelling pretty bad. My mom and aunty are talking to my cousin.

My dad tells them to get out of his house. As of right now I have gotten text messages and phone calls from my family calling me a woman beater. My dad is the only person to believe me. My mom is saying she believes me, but is acting cold.

How do I fix this and stop my family from braking down even more? I blocked my cousin and her parents, but I don't know what to do know. I also feel like my uncle really wants to fight me.

My mom has always been vague about the details of the divorce, just that it was very painful and sudden, and that he never had interest in getting custody of me. 

A couple months ago I was going through documents looking for my birth certificate, and I came across their divorce papers. Surprisingly, my mom was listed as the one who filed for divorce, contradicting her story that he left us. I figured there must have been a reason for this, like him being abusive, but I know that my mom is sensitive about the topic so I didn't want to bring it up. I asked my aunt, her sister, but I was just told to drop it. 

It's been bugging me, so I found him on Facebook. His profile was completely private, but his profile picture showed him with a little boy, who must be my brother. I found his business email online, and against my better judgement I emailed him asking if he would like to meet for coffee. He agreed. 

Last week we met, and he was completely not what I was expecting. He was THRILLED to see me, almost cried, and wanted to hear everything I had been up to for the past 15 years. I asked why he left, and that's when I got his side of the story:

Towards the end of their marriage, my father confessed to my mom that he is bisexual, and that during high school and college he had a serious boyfriend. He was ashamed of his sexuality, which was why he hid it from my more traditional mom. My mom was angry, but didn't divorce him because of it. After the divorce he began dating his boyfriend again, and my mom freaked out over me being ""exposed"" to this. My mom petitioned for full custody, and was granted it. Over the years my father has attempted to reach out to my mom about me, but she has never budged. 

I asked my mom about what really happened, no bullshit. I told her dad's side of the story, and she tearfully admitted that it was true. She insists it was not out of anger or bigotry, but because she genuinely believed that it was best for me to stay with her. 

I am just so shocked still. She lied to me for years, making me think my own father did not want me. My dad and I are reconnecting now, but I have missed so much. Next week I am going to meet his husband and my 7 year old brother. I live with my mom, but I can't speak to her right now. She is begging me to forgive her, but I'm so angry and I don't know how I'll ever not be angry with her."

I've seen these videos before and normally the reaction is the man gets a smile on his face and they obviously get it on.  It's cheesy, romantic, funny, whatever.

My girlfriend is working from home during the pandemic and I work in the hospital. I got home from a 12 hour shift of potentially being exposed to covid-19, and just wanted some beers and to go to bed. I guess my girlfriend thought she would get the same reaction when i walked in the door and saw her naked. 

I barely had enough energy left to give any reaction let alone a good one. I basically just told her i appreciated the gesture but i was exhausted. She got moody at me basically comparing all these other tiktoks where the man gets excited to see their girl naked. I told her all these tiktoks have men working from home, not walking in the door after a 12 hour shift in a hospital during a pandemic. She then took this as an insult at the fact that she's currently working from home, when this wasn't my intention at all.

Since this happened a couple of days ago, she's acting like i don't find her sexy at all and giving my sarcastic answers. What do I even say to her?"

Every single day, at least once, he will tell me that I stink and smell of b.o. 

When we met I showered every day, applied regular deodorant in the morning, brushed my teeth three times a day. Now I am so paranoid about smelling bad that I shower at least twice a day, I apply new industrial strength deodorant every few hours (I have a reminder on my phone), perfume,  and I brush my teeth anytime I eat or drink something that isn’t water. 

I feel like I’m going crazy. I didn’t think I smelled bad in the beginning and I don’t think I smell bad now but I obviously smell bad to him right? Im that weirdo that keeps “sneakily” smelling their own armpits. I have been to the doctor and he has said there is nothing medically wrong. It has honestly gotten to the point where I literally shove my arm pit in friends and families faces asking if I smell bad, they all say I don’t smell like b.o. at all, one friend even said I smelled too clean like a lush store. 

I am getting so paranoid. He won’t cuddle or anything when he says I smell. I really don’t know what more I can do?

Update  - so unexpected edit. I waited for him to make a comment this morning so I could talk to him. It was less than an hour after waking up that he said “god you stink” I had already showered and put on deodorant. 
I snapped and asked what exactly was he smelling because, at this point I’m one of the cleanest people on the planet and if I still smell bad to him then we should just break up. 

He got all  panicked and upset, I eventually got out of him that this is what he father always said to his mother. Apparently his father told him that is was a sure fire technique to have a woman never leave you because “she will feel too low to cheat, will love only you, and will always be clean”.

Needless to say, his father is wrong. He’s packing his things and moving out of my house today."

He also told me he's never been with a black girl before and he thought black girls like rough sex. I was mad and I said no, I'm not ok with rough sex and I was mad he used a stereotype on me. I didn't want to have sex anymore and I asked if he could just leave me alone so he left. 

I'm just so confused like how is this even real. I've never even heard of that as a stereotype. Idk if it's a porn thing or not (I don't watch porn, just not into it) but even if that's a thing, I'm mad he just assumed things about me. He knows I'm a virgin but he still was rough with me. I'm unsure now bc idk what else stereotypes he has about me bc I'm black.

Edit: he's blowing up my phone asking me if we can talk about things and saying sorry. I feel bad for not responding but I keep thinking what else he thinks about me. I feel empty inside because he turned into another person when he got rough. He went from sweet to cold and scary. I think once I'm calm, I will talk to him.

Edit: all of these messages have been overwhelming. I'm going to call him now and hear what he has to say. I will update after. Thanks for the advice, this has been very helpful.

Okay last update cus I can't make a new post and this is getting really cluttered with replies.
 

So we talked for a while. I'm done with him. I read the comments and I decided to hear him out, I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thought black girls like it rough bc his friends girlfriend like that (she's black) and the porn he watches. I tried explaining how that's racist to think that and consent. He said he was sorry for rushing into it but he was raised in a racist community so 'give him a break'.

 I tried explaining that's not an excuse to act out his fetishes on me especially without asking. He got mad at me and I was too. We argued and then I broke up with him.  I am really upset rn, I thought he loved me but I guess not. All I wanted was to share a special moment with him and he ruined it. I told my friend and she said to give him another chance but I disagree. What he did was too weird and creepy for me to forgive him. Anyways thanks for all the advice, I should have just broke up with him immediately but oh well, too late now."
hrrf21,[Update] I walked in on my son having sex with my brother's wife,31697,0.92,3994,2020-07-15 22:34:07,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hrrf21/update_i_walked_in_on_my_son_having_sex_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hrrf21/update_i_walked_in_on_my_son_having_sex_with_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Original post

On mobile 

I first want to thank everyone for all the advice I got from my original post, im sorry for not replying to any comments, (I think I only replied to one comment) my head was all over the place. I'll try to keep this update short.

As was suggested by many of the comments I decided to tell my husband first and proceed from there, my husband lost it(he first thaught it was a joke). We talked about the issue and we decided we should first talk to our son before telling my brother.

We confronted our son with what I saw, he already knew what was going on as he saw my reddit post and put 2 and 2 together, he didn't deny anything he confessed, he told us him and SIL have been having sex since February last year( he was 17 at the time). My son said it started on SIL's birthday  party he attended they got drunk and had sex in a bathroom and they have been meeting at hotels ever since and sneaking off at family gatherings.

After my son's confession my husband just lost it and told my son to leave the house and go and to our condo in town as he didn't want to see him in front of him at this moment. When my son was gone my husband stormed into my brother's room and told my brother everything( SIL was not in the house at that moment).

My brother lost it and packed his stuff took the kids and left, he asked where my son had gone he said he wanted to teach him lesson, we didn't tell him and he eventually left. SIL didn't return I think my brother might have called her or my son warned her and she is afraid to come back(her things are still in the house).

In all the screaming and shouting my daughter's heard everything and are devastated that their family might be ruined they miss their brother and are afraid my husband won't ever let him in the house again.( my husband hates all forms of infidelity to the core and has always drilled this in our 2 eldest children that they must never cheat on anyone or be in a relationship with someone in a relationship)

 I know I did nothing wrong in this but how will I ever look my brother in the eye again, he won't answer and calls or text my husband said i should give him time to heal. My son has left the condo because he is afraid of what my brother will do to him and is now hiding at a friend's and he won't tell us which friend. No word on SIL.

INFO: SIL was the one who initiated sex the first time my son and her slept together, she was the one booking hotel rooms, buying my son dinners and lunches, my son was even receiving an allowance from her."
b1tpdw,Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,31679,0.94,6324,2019-03-16 21:06:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1tpdw/should_i_48m_tell_my_wife_44f_that_i_received_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b1tpdw/should_i_48m_tell_my_wife_44f_that_i_received_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I’ve never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It’s a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says “your eyes only”. It’s my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I’ve no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I’m assuming it’s one of my wife’s ex. Second I’ve know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn’t time stamped so I don’t have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we’re past that. But apparently this person or persons isn’t.

The whole thing is strange. I’m not sure what’s going on. I haven’t told my wife, I’m not sure how she would take it. She’s very sexual and adventurous but I don’t think she’d like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don’t think I’ll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I’m overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two “amateur” looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That’s why the camera doesn’t move and that’s why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it’s him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that’s still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn’t seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she’d rather I didn’t have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I’m just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn’t give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it’s slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I’ve been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I’m upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn’t say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It’s just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I’ll get past it , but it’s not an easy thing. And for everyone who says “it was 20 years ago lighten up” I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won’t love her less but you’ll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I’ll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it’s time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife’s Facebook account - childish and immature I’ll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I’ve given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I’m questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It’s time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest ."

I want to first say that I appear all of the support I’ve received after posting my first post. I have thought a lot on the suggestions that I’ve been given and decided to go forward on some.

I’ve talked with my mother about the situation and she’s agreed to take in my children until this situation is dealt with. I’ve also approached my husband about divorced and put my demands about wanting full custody of our children as well as the house and other things. He hasn’t put up a fight regarding any of those and has agreed to it. 

It’s been really hard into swallow all of this and I’m looking for a lawyer now to help with the divorce. My mother has also suggested to keep the real reasoning of our divorce away from our children as long as possible, especially my eldest daughter (14).

This’ll be my second and last post of this matter. I again want to express that I really appreciate all of the helpful comments and suggestions. Thank you all for the support. ❤️"
dsmcm0,UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,31303,0.97,978,2019-11-07 02:21:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsmcm0/update_to_i_found_out_i_have_a_daughter_who/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsmcm0/update_to_i_found_out_i_have_a_daughter_who/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

iftqhw,Terrified that my (25F) husband (28M) has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. Now I'm pregnant.,30988,0.85,1878,2020-08-24 23:10:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iftqhw/terrified_that_my_25f_husband_28m_has_been_having/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iftqhw/terrified_that_my_25f_husband_28m_has_been_having/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"For some  context, I have a serious medical condition that requires some pretty heavy medication. It does a lot of things, including destroy my sex drive, and knock me out for long periods of time. My husband and I were married before I was diagnosed, and he's supported my through diagnosis and treatment. He's a wonderful man.

We used to have a very active sex life, and it has been a considerable strain on our marriage that I never feel in the mood. I feel like a terrible wife in this regard, and I miss being able to do what we both enjoy.

To be clear, when I take my medication, I am dead to the world. You could blast a fire alarm next to me, and I wouldn't wake up. You could pick me up and toss me around, and I might not wake up.

Lately I've felt worse than normal. Really sick, dizzy, uncomfortable ect. I went to my doctor, scared I might be sick with COVID, and it turns out I'm pregnant. 5 weeks.  But I haven't had sex with my husband in at least two months. Maybe more. I did not cheat on him. I was not assaulted by anyone, anywhere, that I know of. This was not immaculate conception.

I told my husband and he was surprised. It's probably a million in one chance I got pregnant, due to the medication I'm on, and my condition. He was shocked, then excited, and I was just so relieved he didn't accuse me of cheating that I didn't stop to consider why he didn't.

It's been a few days. I've been thinking about when I first started taking my medication. It was hard for him to adjust to me not wanting to have sex, and he used to joke that I could just lay there and watch tv while we do it. Or, and here's what makes me scared, he used to joke that he could just have sex with me while I'm sleeping, and that way I don't have to deal with it, and he can be satisfied. He's mentioned this a couple of times, but always lets it drop when I'm not okay with it.

I've started thinking about all the times I woke up in the morning and had uncomfortable pelvic pressure that usually only comes for me after I have sex--my husband likes to be rough and I don't really mind, we were always pretty wild in bed or adventurous. Or bruises I've had that I can't explain.

I confronted my husband about this. About me being scared he did this to me, and at the least why he wasn't surprised the dates don't match up. He was angry I would accuse him of something so horrible, and insists that I'm just misremembering the last time we had sex. The medication does play with my memory sometimes, but I remember the last time we had sex. I remember every time we have sex now because I don't enjoy it.

I don't want to panic. I don't want to talk myself into being convinced he's been having sex with me while I'm asleep, and I don't want to talk myself out of this possibility just to protect our marriage. But I'm terrified. This is the only possibility I can come up with. And if it's true, I don't know what to do. I've been heartbroken for a while over the idea that I wouldn't be able to have kids. Now I'm going to have a baby and I'm so, so happy. But what if this baby happened because of what my husband did?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I think my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep because of my low sex drive, and now we have a miracle baby that may be a byproduct of it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just wanna say the response to this has been insane. Thank you so much to everyone. I'm really lost and I don't know what to think or do. I'm going to take some time to think about this, get additional information and resources depending on however this is going to go, and figure it out.  Just to be clear, however, because there are too many responses to answer directly, NO, I have never given permission for my husband to have sex with me while I'm sleeping. YES, I have asked him if I have ever instigated something while asleep, sleep walked, sleep spoke, or did anything in my sleep related to sex, and he answered no we have NEVER had sex outside of a time when I was fully cognizant and aware of what's happening. And YES, I am keeping the baby regardless of what happened. If people are interested, I'll post an update when there is something to write. Again, thank you, thank you for all the support and opinions. They all matter. "

Some of you guys have been asking for an update in my messages so I figured I might as well make a post, although it's probably not the „happy“ ending most of you were hoping for.

It's been about a month since my original post and pretty much all of you told me to break up and not to worry about her doing that. I wanted to do it. And I tried.. but it was just the same thing all over again. She started to cry, she kept calling and leaving crying voice mails that she's gonna do it. I just didn't know what to do. So I told her that we can stay together... but I'm just so broken.

She was always being mean to me and she always bullied me, at least for the last 2 years or so. She calls me ugly, makes fun of me and always tries to humiliate me. I was used to do that and I just kind of took it as it were. That I can't do anything about it.

But lately she started hitting me. Now, I'm 6'3"" and she's 4'11"" so it's not that it's painful physically, but it just hurts emotionally so much. Whenever we get into an argument she punches me in the face. Or in the stomach. I'm just broken and lost. I've lost all my confidence, I lost all my friends because she didn't like any of them. And it just sucks.

I just accepted that this is how my life is and it's probably not gonna change. I'm so sorry for disappointing everyone who believed that I can do it.

I'm sorry.

Also, I'm not from the United States. The Police won't assist me in the break up, they don't have any 72hr psych and they told me that they can't do anything unless she actually tries to kill herself. 

EDIT: I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna drive to see her tomorrow, take my parents with me as support and I'm gonna end it. I just can't anymore. Thank you guys.

7 years ago I got married to the girl of my dreams Denise(Fake name), we had been dating for 2 years before that and it was like a dream come true, that changed after our marriage. After our marriage she constantly started feeling down and out of it and eventually I got her to go to a doctor who sent her to a therapist and from there we found out she had depression to do with things from her past that she was trying to forget. I decided to be as supportive as I could be, I took care of most of the house work, despite working 40 hours a week and told her to just get herself in order and if she needed to talk to me I would be there for her.

That was 6 and a half years ago, before she left she was still depressed, she basically only lays in bed and complains, she does nothing, we had no intimacy, no sex, no cuddles, no going out, my entire day was filled with work and house work. Day in and day out I worked my ass off, came home to a mess of a house and started cleaning up, starting dinner and so forth at the end of the day I was exhausted and all I could expect was for Denise to unload more of her trouble on me and complain about herself, me and everything around her. I could not even hang out with my buddies to get away from it all as she would relentlessly call me saying she was scared and everything so I also had no social life, not that I had time for it anyway...But despite it all I pushed through hoping that sooner or later she would break out of it and we could have a proper life together as I loved her and as they say for better and worse and this was quite clearly worse, possibly the worst it would ever be.

4 months ago she got a new therapist and 3 months ago that therapist suggested she needed time away from me as her depression started when we married so I may be the cause of it, the moment she told me I was crushed, I started doubting myself, blaming myself, worrying, but beneath it all this creeping sense of having done everything for her, having sacrificed years of my life as a cashcow and a servant for her to lay in bed and this is my thanks? It is my fault now? But I rejected that feeling, trying to talk through it, but she decided to leave and stay with her mother, saying she needed time away from me and that I may be the cause of her depression and so forth, honestly the entire argument is a blur in my head.

I spend the next month when she moved out calling her, her family, begging and humiliating myself just to get her back, apologizing for everything I may have done wrong, honestly I was close to ending it all as I was so hopeless at that point. But that month passed and as it passed I couldn't help but feel relieved, I came home and it was quiet, I could indulge in my hobbies which I had not done in years, the place was not a mess every time I came home, I could relax and two months in I even realized I could hang out with my buddies again, grabbing a beer, enjoying life and slowly I started to realize that I had been miserable this entire time. Slowly that turned in to more and more realizations before I realized I honestly did not love her anymore, I felt like my youth was wasting away, I could do much, much better than this, I felt like I was a caretaker of a handicapped old lady, hell I still looked good and as I went out I started once again gaining back my self confidence, women would flirt with me, I felt wanted even though I never did flirt back.

After all these realizations I suddenly got a call from my wife, saying she made a huge mistake, she was sobbing her eyes out and how she was an idiot taking the therapists words as fact and how much she loved me. For a moment I wanted to say yes, yes please come back...But I couldn't, I just blurted it out and said to her she had left me and I was done with this relationship, I told her I would get divorce papers and I told her I had wasted enough time as it was and this final action of hers was the nail in the coffin, after that I just dropped the phone, started crying for a bit before turning in and feeling liberated.

The issue now is, is that everyone in my family is telling me I am making a mistake, I should take her back, I owe it to her to try and make it work, marriage is not always fun etc. The thing is, I never had fun in this marriage, I can't remember the last time I had fun and wasn't miserable, we are both young and fit and we never even go out, hell the last time we had sex is over a year ago, all I am to her is a fucking servant as it seems and I rather live along then spend one more hour taking care of her. But on the other end, I doubt myself, am I really dumping someone that is depressed? I feel horrible about it, I feel like a failure...I just need advice.

EDIT: Wow, I stepped away from my phone for a while and return to a ton of comments, thank you all so much, I will try to read them all.

EDIT 2: While I have a hard time defending my wife right now, let me clarify something that is popping up in some comments. I know for a fact that she did not sleep around with anyone while we were separated.

I finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. A lot of things that I never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

As soon as she opened the door to our apartment, I could tell that she was already starting to cry. Seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because I didn’t want to put her in that position. 

I had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

We sat down, there were lots of tears. I thought I would be bitter, angry and that I would be screaming at her the whole time but I felt disappointed instead. 

I told her that I saw the messages and explained how I ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

She kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn’t know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

Then I told her that WE go more way back than they ever did. I was there through her lowest point, I helped her get up.

She admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

I saw it coming, I had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. At that point, I was full on crying. I can’t remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. It still is now. 

I remember telling her that I was done, that whatever we had was over. She kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, I don’t think I ever will. I can’t tolerate people who cheat.

By that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

Obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

When I posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. His place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. He’ll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that I can’t bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

We both agreed that I don’t mention him in this post. I’m glad that I really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. Thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

It’s almost 3am, I’m heartbroken as ever but I’m trying my best. I’m sending my resignation letter to work this morning. Every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. I’ll be flying home as soon as possible. 

To all my Aussie mates,  if you live near/around Chapel Hill, let me know! 

America, you were great but now it’s time to come home. Thanks for the help everyone.

EDIT: I’m crying again, not because I got cheated on but because I realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. I almost can’t believe I looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. I am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

Anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

I may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but I gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

Other than that, I am feeling better. It still feels surreal that she’s gone but what can a bloke do? She made her choice so I made mine. 

I woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that I shouldn’t rush things and that she’s stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

It sucks that I may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. I thanked them and said that although I believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

Ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so I junked it straight away. 

I miss her like crazy. I know it will take a lot of time to heal me but I guess I can wait. 

ps. I’ll message my newfound Aussie friends when I go through all the comments. Exact date of my flight hasn’t been sorted out yet, but I’m hoping i’ll be home by next month.

We’ve been together for a little over a year now and it’s been going well! We met at college through a club and hit it off then reconnected a couple years later. He’s always been really kind to me and gives me compliments all the time and we generally have fun together. 

We’ve been quarantining together and have been having a lot of sex, which I love, but it’s been getting a little weirder, I guess? He sends me a lot of hentai and says he wants to try things out that are depicted in it which is fine. But he’s also been buying me outfits (which I do appreciate) and they’re very much like anime themed? Japanese schoolgirl, cat-girl costume, etc. etc. I know he’s being more open sexually with me but it all feels kind of... gross? Like he wants me to do all of these things because I’m Asian? Anyway the other night he asked me to “act cuter” in the bedroom and to speak Japanese to him in bed. I was really offended by this because while I’m Asian I’m not Japanese. I’m Taiwanese, but born and raised here in America. I firmly told him no and the night went on alright but he was a little quiet afterwards like I’d scolded him. 

I don’t think he means anything weird by it, but I want to tell him I’m not okay with the things he’s been doing but also I don’t want to shame him for being more open sexually with me. I just want to feel like he wants to be intimate with ME and not with Asian Girl #7, if that makes sense. I don’t know how to explain this to him though?"
fd6kbb,I (34m) conducted a paternity test behind my wife’s back on our 12 year old son.,30474,0.93,1556,2020-03-04 08:34:15,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fd6kbb/i_34m_conducted_a_paternity_test_behind_my_wifes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fd6kbb/i_34m_conducted_a_paternity_test_behind_my_wifes/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Typing this out in Mobile. Apologies for grammar or formatting 

A little back story before I get to the meat. My wife and I met when I was 20. We had a drunk hookup the first night we met. We continued seeing each other after that night. A few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. We stayed together and I proposed a few months later. I had doubts about her pregnancy lining up with our timeline but I never brought it up or discussed it. Not to mention I was in the military and deployed a few months later. My proposal weighed a lot on her carrying my child. I grew up in a home without a dad and never wanted that. 


Fast forward 12 years we are still married. Though it has been extremely volatile and rocky I’ve stayed together honestly because I could never part from my son. I can’t let him grow up with an absent father. So I’ve made it work. Our marriage is dead outside of our child. 


I ran into an old friend who I knew around the time I met my wife. He asked if I was still with her and I said yes. He mentioned how “it was crazy I dated her and then you stole her from me!” I wasn’t sure what he meant and asked him to elaborate. He said “it’s no big deal but I was seeing her up until that weekend you met her.” I dropped it but inside my doubt and insecurities ran wild. I couldn’t get it out of head. I broke down and bought a home DNA test kit and used it on my son and I without telling my wife. 


The results came back today. He is not my son. 0% chance I am his biological son. I’m destroyed. My whole world is upside down. I’m just on autopilot at the moment. I don’t know how to act or feel. I’m just a zombie right now. 


One thing I know is no matter what he is my son. I’ve been by his side the moment he was born and will absolutely never abandon him. Absolutely nothing will change that. 

What I haven’t decided is how if at all I bring it up to my wife. I feel like my whole marriage was a lie. I can’t help but wonder if she knew. How do I confront her. Regardless that I’m not in love with her I still love her. This will crush her. This will absolutely devastate her. I don’t know what to do. I plan on seeing a counselor/therapist ASAP. So many emotions and thoughts flooding my mind. Just need some help to bring me back down.

EDIT: I appreciate all the support and words of advice. Both good, bad and the assholes. I’m going to sit on this until I get my head right."

One of the things we’ve just recently come across is CNC. We both agreed to do and and came up with the safe word, as advised. 
While we were into it, he became extremely rough with me. I said our safe word because I wanted to stop but he ignored it, I said it again, he ignored it once more. I started trying to push he off and he just held me back down. He continued until he *finished* .

He’s been treating me like an asshole ever since. I told him what he did was wrong and he ignored our safe word. He told me that I’m overreacting and that he made it more fun and realistic. I told him he borderline raped me, and he said “ it’s not possible for a husband to rape his wife” He’s also treating as if I’ve done something wrong. I made dinner for us, he waited until I was finished and said that he’s eating out, after watching me spend 1 1/2 hour cooking dinner. I just don’t know what to do."
ijx2zy,I (28m) accidentally punched a woman. She went around telling people that I intentionally hit her and also that I was abusive to my wife.,30321,0.92,2780,2020-08-31 18:01:05,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ijx2zy/i_28m_accidentally_punched_a_woman_she_went/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ijx2zy/i_28m_accidentally_punched_a_woman_she_went/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Last week, there was a small get together at my friend’s house; just us 9-10 of us close friends. Now he invited one of his friends, Susan (28f) and she brought along her brother (30m), who none of us knew. My wife (28f) was present there too. 

Her brother, Dave, was being weird with my wife from the get-go. Half the time he was there he was staring at my wife inappropriately and trying to touch her whenever he found her alone. She even asked me to hold her hand the entire time because he was making her uncomfortable. I told her we could leave if she wanted to, but she said she won’t let a creep sabotage her evening. This was a bad decision on our part; should’ve left earlier. 

I got a work call in the middle of the party, and my wife told me to take the call and assured me she would be fine with her friend, Lisa. When I came back after 5 minutes, I see Dave trying to talk to Lisa and my wife and both of them looked very uncomfortable. Apparently he’d been trying to convince them to get inside the pool naked. I confronted him, and well, things escalated. He said some colourful words to my wife and Lisa, implied that my wife was totally leading him on before I came back. 

I physically shoved him away from my wife and Lisa. He retaliated and not proud of this but we got into a fist fight. It was all adrenaline and fists and punches. I raise my hand to punch him, gained enough momentum that’d have knocked his teeth out and all of a sudden,his sister, Susan comes in front of him trying to shield him. And my fist hit her in the face. I apologised, I profusely apologised and even offered to take her to the hospital. I’ve never raised my hands on a woman and I never will. This was a fuck up and I was very ashamed of myself. 

Susan didn’t accept my offer and neither my apologies. Dave took her to the hospital. The next day, she put up a story on Instagram about how I hit her, with a photo of her injury and her face. The story they’re going with is that my wife and Lisa were totally hitting on Dave and when I found out, I hit Susan out of anger. Now I’ve been getting threatening messages on my social media accounts, someone even found my LinkedIn profile and messaged my company asking why they hired ‘woman abusers’. Lisa and my wife have tried to mitigate this disaster by posting the correct version of this story, but it looks like people have made up their minds that I’m an abusive asshole. Some have even messaged my wife asking her to divorce me or if I abuse her too or why is she supporting someone who hits women. 

I contacted Susan through my lawyer and said that we’re gonna sue for defamation and slander, that let’s settle this in court and that other people present at the party are ready to testify against her. Dave and her are now begging us to forgive them as they’re very poor (they are, both have been unemployed since two-three years) and they’re even ready to post on SM that they lied. 

My wife thinks that we should definitely sue them. Lisa thinks that a court case will really fuck them over and destroy their lives. I kinda agree with both of them. What should I do?

Edit : I replied to a comment saying this and since a lot of people think that I shouldn’t have gotten into a physical altercation with the guy,I’ll replay his exact words. ‘Your wife was begging for my cock before you rudely interrupted us.’ This was when I shoved him away and then he threw the first punch. It escalated from there. I know this isn’t a justification for the physical fight but well, it is what it is."
ertsws,My (23f) boyfriend (29m) hates that I wear boxers to bed,30235,0.86,5843,2020-01-21 17:41:55,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ertsws/my_23f_boyfriend_29m_hates_that_i_wear_boxers_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ertsws/my_23f_boyfriend_29m_hates_that_i_wear_boxers_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,False,,False,"We've been together 3 months.

My sleepwear consists entirely of tank tops and underwear. I have underwear for during the day and for dates, which is primarily small and lacey, and then I've got women's briefs and men's boxers (usually a cotton blend) for sleeping. They're really comfy and really big. I don't think they're ugly, they're just not very cute.

My boyfriend slept over last night and I went to get dressed for bed and as I pull out the briefs he goes ""do you have to wear those?"" so I pull out the boxers. He says that's worse and asks if I can wear some of my ""nice"" underwear to bed. I tell him that wearing lace all day and then overnight and again the following day is how you get yeast infections and he asks me why I had to mention yeast infections.

I put them on and go to get into bed and he asks me to take them off, not for sex, but just so I'm not wearing boxers to bed. I ask him what the big deal is and he says ""forgive me for wanting to find you attractive"". I don't know what to say to that but he rolls over, straight to sleep, no cuddling.

This morning I wake him, we kiss, I'm thinking it'll lead to sex, but he touches my boxers, stops, gets dressed and leaves.

This is starting to affect my self esteem just a bit. I'm only wearing them because they're comfortable and I don't want to buy all new stuff, but this is apparently a real turn off for him and it's causing problems. What do I do to fix this issue without completely caving?

TL;DR: Boyfriend hates me wearing boxers to bed, wants me to wear my regular underwear to bed, and says boxers are a turn off. I like wearing them and don't want to buy new sleepwear. Is there a compromise that doesn't involve me sleeping with my arse out?

UPDATE: texted and asked. He thinks it's ""gay"". As a bisexual woman I cannot see an alternative to breaking up right now.

Edit: He is not gay. Or bi. Or otherwise experiencing internalized homophobia. 99% of homophobes are straight. He is within that 99%. This is not glee."

First things first: I had my healthy baby girl on Monday evening. We were discharged shortly after birth due to Covid so I have been just trying to adjust to everything. Her birth was a dream and I never want to do it again. Lol. 

Second: I talked to his wife for over an hour yesterday. I guess he decided to tell her. She wasn't mad at me, thank God. She'd had her suspicions but was trying to trust her husband which I understand. She was so nice honestly and even though she isn't angry at me I still feel bad because she's such a nice lady. She wanted to make sure I was doing okay and that I didn't need anything which made me cry because postpartum hormones are whack. She's getting a divorce from him (good for her tbh). We are planning to meet up and talk shit about him once the virus is over. 

I have a lawyer and will establish custody and child support legally asap. He hasn't bothered to contact me at all but I don't particularly care. 

I didn't want to leave anyone hanging even though it's not a huge update. Thank you to everyone who checked in. It means a lot."

isyxrx,Update: my [33m] wife [25f] constantly makes a conscious effort to humiliate me during my lessons over Zoom,29740,0.94,3188,2020-09-15 07:04:16,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/isyxrx/update_my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/isyxrx/update_my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"About a week and a half ago, I made a post here about my wife consciously trying to sabotage my lessons over Zoom. It seemed that everything she did was just to embarrass me in front of my students. If you want more information about the situation, you can find the original post here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/

My first lesson after making that post, my wife went straight back to her old antics. I was in the lesson room as students gradually joined, talking to a student who was interested in luxury cars. At some point during the conversation, I said “yeah I think I’d have to go with the Lamborghini there.” I heard from behind the door in the basement where I was teaching “LaMBorGhiNi” in the sarcastic exaggerated tone of voice that kids will use to mock you. I realized she was being childish again, but figured she’d eventually tire herself out.

A few minutes after the lesson started, I used the word “circumference” to describe a word problem. I then heard “ciRCuMFeREnCe” from behind the door at the top of the stairs, followed by giggling. Since the timing was right, as I was about to have the students take a shot at a problem, I set them to the task, muted my mic/disabled my camera, and quietly crept up the stairs. I suddenly opened the door to find my wife with a cup over her ear pushed against the door so she could hear me. 

I whisper-shouted at her for her behavior for about a minute. I asked if she was five years old and what the hell was wrong with her. She feigned fear and shock as if I had held her against the wall with my hands wrapped around her throat, which made me just sigh and go back downstairs to finish my lesson.

For the rest of the lesson she was quiet, but after it I went upstairs to bring up what she did. She started asking if I was going to yell at her again. I responded that I wouldn't, and I tried to get back on topic, but no matter what I said about her behavior, her response was the same. When I brought up her stomping in the room above before, “are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up her sliding plastic files under the door during a lesson before, “oh, are you going to yell at me again?” When I brought up anything she has done during lessons, the answer was the same, over and over again.

There is absolutely no way to broach the topic with her now. I called her doctor and said that her behavior is erratic, and that she might have PPD. The doctor said that he could ask about it when she came in, but there is not much else he could do. The next day I tried to sit my wife down for a calm discussion about the possibility of her having PPD, to which she responded she had PTSD from my “abusive shouting.” Right. When I suggested therapy, together, she said “oh, to fix your anger management problems? Sounds good.”

I teach in my car in front of a Starbucks now. Outside of lesson time we haven't really had any issues, and now that I'm outside the house teaching, we are strained but stable. I know this is not a very satisfactory outcome, but I think she has deep underlying issues that are going to need professional intervention. When I said I would happily go to therapy with her to find a solution to our communication issues, she told me that I should go alone. I think that may actually be a good step because having a neutral party to listen to my worries and guide me towards better de-escalation tactics would be highly beneficial. I could also try to entice her to join gradually.

TL;DR: my wife has no desire to change. I’m going to start therapy alone and see if I can’t get her to join. Her doctor will bring up the possibility of PPD in her next appointment."

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should “sit down and talk.” She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me “I already know what this is about.” My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under “popular.” Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said “I was just joking, I wasn’t serious.” She then went on saying stuff like “I love you, I love you.” I told her I can’t be in a marriage where my S/O doesn’t love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she “didn’t want to lose me.” I told her I don’t think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she’ll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I’ve never been so happy with a decision I’ve made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me “Fuck you.” She started screaming at me, telling me “you just can’t end things like that.” I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that’s when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, “You’re the fucking worst relationship I’ve ever been in. You think I can’t find someone again?” “Do you think you’ll ever from someone as good as me? You’re a fucking idiot [my name].” She grabbed her bag and phone, and said “I’m leaving!” Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you’d find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I’m still crying as I type this up. It’s both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I’m gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I’m gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that’s essentially where they belong. (I’m not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn’t. I’ve been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my “wife” yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don’t even know. I’m going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can’t change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, “Sweetie, remember it’s your choice. Don’t settle for just anyone. That’s the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up.” Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven’t said anything about it since. I honestly don’t know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset."

She was taking a turn and obviously wasn't looking because she took the turn wide and hit a kid from school who was riding to the bike racks. He was in the other lane that goes the other way. Our car went over him and I heard him yell out. I don't like ""know"" him but he's in a different year than me.

After that happened mum just kept driving. I told her we need to call the police or ambulance or something. Mum just kept saying that he swerved and hit her and that we don't call the police if we did nothing wrong. She told me to keep quiet and knows i'll do the right thing.

I saw a photo on insta of him in the hospital and he's all bruised and looks rough as guts. I've just been feeling really bad and it's like I can't eat and feel like throwing up. It's like mum did something really wrong and it feels really bad to not say anything. I wasn't even allowed to tell dad about it (but him and mum are divorced and I'm not allowed to tell him lots of things...). If I tell someone, mum will probably get arrested and then it'll be my fault.

I don't know and want to stop feeling so bad, do I tell on my mum or not?"
i6y27n,My unborn child absorbed it’s twin and now my wife resents it.,29300,0.92,1561,2020-08-10 09:48:54,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6y27n/my_unborn_child_absorbed_its_twin_and_now_my_wife/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6y27n/my_unborn_child_absorbed_its_twin_and_now_my_wife/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"At our 10 week scan we were told we were having twins. Having tried for 7+ years and this being our first real pregnancy, my wife was ecstatic. Cue a few weeks later our doctor is checking for heartbeats and he only finds 1. We go for another ultrasound and one of our twins had died and been absorbed by the other, which is why my wife had no glaring miscarriage symptoms. 
At first she was fine. Then she started joking that our baby would grow up to be a serial killer as “he already has 1 checked off”. Soon it was becoming clear that the idea our unborn fetus somehow murdered its twin intentionally was no longer a joke in my wife’s mind. I tried explaining the fetus had passed on its own, it hadn’t been absorbed to death. This didn’t work so I asked our doctor, her gynaecologist, her mother, her sister and her dad to all try explaining it too but it was no use. She has fully convinced herself that our unborn child is a murderer. 

I really don’t know what to do. My mom tells me she’ll go “back to normal” when her pregnancy hormones drop but I am really concerned as I know the drop in hormones can actually make people even more unpredictable and I hate to say this about my wife, but dangerous. I don’t want to leave her. We’ve waited so long to be parents together and I know this isn’t my wife, she is just grieving. The multiple ultrasounds have put us badly in the negative after already being screwed over by covid so we can’t afford therapy for a little while. 

Any advice? thanks"

I reported my ex friend to the police and based off the drugs in my system matching some that he had hidden in his room and all of the dna they collected from me at the hospital they were able to arrest him. My parents found out but haven’t apologized for blaming me.

hbn4w3,[UPDATE] I want to read my daughter’s diary to find out why she left us. My wife says absolutely not,29060,0.94,955,2020-06-19 02:42:16,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hbn4w3/update_i_want_to_read_my_daughters_diary_to_find/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hbn4w3/update_i_want_to_read_my_daughters_diary_to_find/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"First and foremost, thank you all so so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences dealing with losing a loved one. Secondly, I’m sorry if this post isn’t necessarily the neatest,  I am still at a loss for words.

Basically, I’m a pathetic excuse of a father for not realizing that my son goes on Reddit (I don’t keep track of the social media apps he uses), so he saw my original post where many of y’all were urging me to read my daughter’s diary. My son did so behind our backs and we only came to find out when he lashed out, calling his sister selfish and all the names under the sun for doing what she did. My wife on the other hand is beyond pissed at my son for reading our daughter’s diary. She said that our daughter is going to be mad at our family when she “gets back,” only to find out that one of us read it. I’m guessing she hasn’t accepted the fact that she’s gone and will never return. 

As for me and my wife, we haven’t read our daughter’s diary, only our son did. Based on my son’s reaction, I can assume that you guys were right, that her diary is filled with hatred, as if someone else wrote in it. I don’t know the contents of it but I know how and who my daughter was and her brother loved her who for who she was and now, he can’t stand it when his sister’s name is mentioned. That was exactly what I was afraid of that after reading her diary, our perspective of her would be completely different.

My son is temporarily speaking with a family member who’s a therapist and we’ll be switching him over to a different one hopefully by next week to avoid conflict of interests and as a family, we’re now in contact with a counselor. I want to talk to my wife about her getting into therapy too, as she still thinks our daughter is still here but she’s just away on a “trip,” my wife calls it. But beyond that, still nothing much has changed. My wife still cries every night and though my son very much upset with his sister, we still find him around his sister’s room. And for me? Nothing, still empty and probably always will be, which isn’t fair to my son and wife so I’ll probably seek a therapist for myself as well. Plus, I know many marriages don’t survive after the death of a child, so marriage counseling is something I want to bring up to my wife when I feel is appropriate.

What about the diary? It’s gone, hidden well within our home. Hell, I may even forget where it’s at years down the line but I do know I want to read it when I’m ready, whether that’s with my wife or not. I want to know her struggles, read her fun times (if she has any written), and what made her do it. I know reading it won’t give me closure, but it will give me an insight of what she was going through and let that be a lesson for me to be better for my son and to just always be there whether he’s feeling fine or not.

That’s about it. My heart still physically hurts from the loss of my daughter and for the rest of my family as they’re also in so much pain. Some of you guys might be expecting this update to be about the contents of the diary but I’m choosing not to read it for a long, long time. And if my wife wants to? I won’t stop her, but I do want to tell her that she may not recognize our own daughter as my son didn’t. Only time will heal our wounds and lots and lots of therapy and support. Thank you all so much for your thoughts and prayers. I can say for myself that it brought me a bit of comfort after such a massive loss.

Again, thank you all so much.

EDIT: Many apologies for the typos, my mind has been in shambles."
h7brue,My (24M) girlfriend (26F) fully believes that she is a cat in a human's body.,28985,0.95,3483,2020-06-12 07:28:55,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7brue/my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that_she_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7brue/my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that_she_is/,self.relationship_advice,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8wzqq/update_my_24m_girlfriend_26f_fully_believes_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Tl;dr: gf now thinks she is an otherkin, a cat in a human's body and refuses to see anything wrong with the situation. The echo chamber she is now has done nothing but enable her and I don't know what to do.

I know people are going to think I'm either trolling or baiting but please read before you comment + this post has nothing to do with gender or trans issues and I am in no way intending to be offensive or anything.

So Gf and I have been together for nearly 8 months, and she's always been a very quirky and nerdy person: does cosplays, very into anime and roleplaying, etc... Nothing too weird. We've been kinda distant lately with everything going on and me being an essential worker so haven't seen eachother and only talk for half an hour a day. Well, last tuesday we got to hang out at her place and she wore cat ears a and a belt with a tail the entire time. At first I thought it was either going to be a sex surprise or her testing  a new cosplay, but nope, she sat me down, asked me if I really do love her, then hit me with a very long monologue that essentially summed up to  ""I'm a cat in a human body"". Wish I was joking.

I thought I misunderstood and then believed that maybe it was a weird joke but she kept being serious about it, and doubling down. I left shortly after because I had a shift at work, and I still believed it was an oddly drawn out joke nothing more. She ended up texting me with resources to help me understand, which is when I realized that she really is serious. Apparently she believes she is an otherkin:  a person who holds the belief that they are not human. She says she was introduced to this by one of her friends months ago and has since joined discords and communities of others like her. Her friend believes he is a demon trapped in a human body, and she sent me a testimonial that was supposed to be touching but its basically just about a dude thinking he is naruto. I'm not joking. She explained her otherkin type as being a cat, and now she 100% thinks she is a cat. How did she know she was a cat you ask? According to her: sleeping a lot, liking the sun, hating water,  feeling more comfortable crawling on all fours, and claiming to understand what cats are saying and being able to talk to them through meowing. She has also apparently been distant with nearly everybody we know IRL as I got multiple messages asking me to let her know to be in touch with them.

My head has been spiraling this past week, I keep thinking its a joke but nope she is deathly serious about this and has handed in her two weeks resignation at her job because cats don't work. Again, I wish I was joking. I've been limiting my interactions with her ever since, because this is hurting my head a whole lot and I just can't cope. She has also surrounded herself with a large amount of yes men and women who support her 100% and are enabling this, some even encouraging her to make a patreon and make otherkin content that they would contribute to, which she brought up when I asked her about quitting her job. To make things worse, I can't discuss this with anyone in real life because I know how crazy it sounds and I know that leaving her is a valid option but I'm in love with this woman and now I don't recognize her and I know that there is something very very wrong and I can't reach out to her and she refuses to hear anything from me unless it is unconditional support. What the fuck do i do ?

EDIT: Just got off work and was very surprised with the amount of comments, I honestly just expected a bunch calling me crazy. I'm reading through them now and I want to say thank you to everybody who took the time out of their day to give me advice, I truly appreciate it. To address some things:

\- Her and I have been friends for 2+ years prior to dating, so that is why I am reluctant to just up and leave.

\- I've read a comment asking if she has a history of mental illness, and not to my knowledge? Aside from her being diagnosed with mild social anxiety in high school. I am going to try and reach out to her mom to get her to check up on her, and maybe even visit. They have a good relationship, so maybe that will help.

\- Yesterday was the first time I truly confronted what was going on, as I have been kind of shelving it and just praying and hoping it was some kind of drawn out joke. But now that I've had time to truly ponder it, I think it has been a long time coming. She's been buying a lot of cat memorabilia and a lot of her cosplays are cat related, and when I brought up the possibility of me getting a cat in the near future she made a joke about being too territorial for a cat, and now that I think about it...well, yeah.

\-I don't know who demon man really is, all I know is that he has been part of her virtual Dnd group since last year. Also so far no litterbox in the picture, sorry to disappoint/relieve some of you. When I asked her about her plans as a ""cat"" other than quitting her job, she had sent me her to do list which I didn't bother opening or reading until yesterday because I was too busy wishing all of this was a fever dream. The To do list includes purchasing a scratch post for her nails, switching to an carnivore diet, and dying her hair red because she is a ginger cat. Yup.

\-As much as it hurts, I have no intention to continue to be in a romantic relationship with her because she will absolutely not hear anything if it's not 100% support. I love her, but I love myself and I don't want to be dragged down to something like this especially when it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall. I will however try to remain in contact with her just to make sure she's not spiraling towards a mental break. I will visit her today to have a talk and officially break it off even though she's been refusing to see me unless I am completely on board, I will update if anything interesting happens. Then I will buy a couple of bottles of alcohol and down them in my flat, no judgement.

\-I've really enjoyed the cat puns, and apparently I need to google who Maureen is."
i98ccy,[Update] My Fiance's ex sent me their sex tapes and I made the terrible mistake of watching it,28943,0.91,903,2020-08-14 02:38:12,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i98ccy/update_my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i98ccy/update_my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Here is a link to the original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/?ref=share&ref_source=link

As for the update, after posting here and reading the advice and reflecting on my actions, I realized what I did was wrong and a violation of my fiance's privacy. I allowed my insecurities to dictate my actions. Even though my fiance is okay with me using his phone, my intent to snoop made what i did wrong.  So I decided to just come clean.

I sat him down the next day and told him that the ex sent me the videos as well, and also came clean about the snooping. He was pretty upset, but surprisingly he wasn't that upset with the snooping, he seemed more upset that his ex had somehow managed to cause drama once again in his life. He told me that he hadn't watched any of the videos because in a majority of them he was uncomfortable with recording them and only did it for her and was afraid if watching it made me look at him in a bad way. This made me feel even shittier for what i did and I apologized again and reassured him that they did not in anyway lessen my feelings or respect for him. I wanted him to have some time to process things and decide what to do about the ex and what I did, so I gave him some space.

That night, I decided to cook his favorite meal as a sort of apology dinner and discuss things. He seemed in a much better mood. He apologized to me for not telling me about the tapes right away and for being an idiot and not realizing that she would come after me when he had blocked her. He told me he appreciated me coming clean about the snooping and understood how I got carried away and that I could have just talked to him and he would have given me his phone and reassured me that he hadn't kept any of the videos.

I asked if he was going to press charges regarding revenge porn and he told me that he wanted nothing to do with her and that we should just move on and enjoy our engagement and forget the whole thing. I told him it was completely his choice and I support him and would delete the videos and block her right away.

Finally, I brought up the texts and he apologized to me for the rant. He told me that was the first time in a long time that he had actually thought about who was better and that he had never actively compared me with any of his exes before. He told me he should have just answered it with a simple ""my fiancee is better"", and tried to apologize again. I told him that he didn't have to sugarcoat anything and that it was his private conversation with a friend and I have no right to be mad when he wasn't really disrespectful about me or our sex life. I also told him that it was okay if she was better and I didn't have to be the best at everything.

He explained to me that after talking to Sarah he thought more about it and that he hadn't really expressed his thoughts well in the text but he would like to explain it better:

> You are the best I have had, I am not lying or sugarcoating anything. If someone asked me who is the most skilled or the most adventurous sexual partner that I have had, then yeah it would probably be her. 

>But that doesn't really matter because if someone asked me what was the best sex I have ever had, my first thought would be the time when we had sex right after you asked me to marry you, and then it would be the night when you first told me you loved me and third would be the time when we had sex in the kitchen the day I moved in. For all her skill and experience, she couldn't even make the top 3, and we have the rest of our lives to make sure that she doesn't even come near the top 100. So no, I am not lying when I say you are the best I have had.

I am not going to lie, despite what I said about not needing to be the best, just hearing what he said (maybe i butchered the quote, he was so much more charming and eloquent) made me really happy, so I kissed him and asked him if he wanted to try and break into the top 3 again. Then, we had sex :) . I didn't really specifically try to be more aggressive but I tried to focus more on what he was feeling to reassure myself that he was enjoying it as much as I did. That naturally allowed me to be the one in the lead and it was great. I could tell that he really enjoyed it as well.

I know I have to work on my insecurities and potentially see a therapist, but for now I will try my best to just forget what I saw on those videos and enjoy being engaged to the most amazing man I know.

TL;DR: I fessed up, my fiance was very graceful and even tried to take some of the blame. We made up and will continue to enjoy the post engagement bliss.

PS: I appreciate the harsh comments that told me I was wrong to snoop. But those of you that sent me hateful pms telling me that I was no better than his ex and that I should leave him? Seriously, fuck off. I maybe an insecure nut sometimes, but I have never ever taken it out on him and would never hurt him like she did. And me wanting to be the best sex he has had is not some narcissistic ego trip. It was because to me he is the best sex I have ever had (and hopefully ever will) and I wanted to be the same for him. I don't think there is anything wrong with that."
blird0,UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,28776,0.92,502,2019-05-07 04:08:25,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

Thanks Reddit."
hu9xlv,My (22M) vegan girlfriend (21F) wants me to get rid of my cat,28676,0.94,7746,2020-07-20 04:20:45,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu9xlv/my_22m_vegan_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_get_rid/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"I can't believe I'm about to type this but here we go.

I've been dating my GF for 7 months. She's amazing and we're super compatible in a lot of ways. She is an outspoken vegan, and she made it clear at the start of our relationship that it was important to her that any potential had similar cruelty-free values. Me, already being a pescatarian, had little difficulty transitioning to a fully plant based diet. My GF was proud of me for going cruelty free and everything seemed well. We became ""the vegan couple"" on our college campus.

Then there is my cat, Mittens... I've had her for three years and I adore her. She's such a sweet and cuddly cat. However, my GF was always a little apprehensive around her, and she blamed it on not growing up around cats. After a while we sort of made a tacit agreement to mostly hang out at her apartment instead of mine, so Mittens never really came up again in conversation.

Fast forward through all the quarantine stuff... My gf and I have spent a lot of time together during this pandemic and we've started talking about taking our relationship to the next level. We began seriously looking at either buying a new apartment together or having one of us move in with the other.

However, after a lot of talking and planning, my GF sat me down and dropped a bomb shell on me. She said that with this next phase of the relationship, she did not see a future with me unless I was willing to give away Mittens. She said that she believed owning a cat is unconscionable for vegans, because they hunt mice and eat meat, and because the very act of owning a pet is a violation of vegan principles.

I was stunned. I told her that I was absolutely not willing to give up Mittens, and she had no choice but to eat meat so I was reducing harm as much as possible by buying reputable brands of cat food. Plenty of vegans own cats and think along those same lines. My gf got mad and said ""how much flesh does your cat eat? How many animals died to make all that food? Would you be okay with that being human flesh?""

I got mad and told my GF that I would have really appreciated her telling me about her cat opinions before we got serious. She went on and on about cats killing animals. I ended the conversation there. I was so angry that I left my gfs apartment. And I snuggled with Mittens when I got home! Although the mood soured a bit when my GF sent me a link to a Reddit thread advocating for the extinction of domestic cats. Sigh

I think it goes without saying that I am not going to get rid of my cat. However, it pains me to think that an otherwise wonderful relationship could be ending because of a difference in ideology. I don't even really understand where my GF is coming from because like I said, a lot of vegans own cats. Now granted, cat ownership can be a controversial topic in vegan circles and I probably would not have gotten a cat if I had been vegan at the time, but I have Mittens now, and she deserves to eat. (Yes, I've researched vegan cat food, but Mittens has some digestive issues and my vet strongly cautions against it.)

I've talked to some of my vegan and vegetarian friends and they all think my gf has lost her mind. Some have suggested that it's not about Mittens and my gf just wants an excuse to end it. They probably don't understand why I haven't broken up yet, but I care about my GF so much. I'd hate for this bizarre curve ball to be the end of a beautiful thing. I want to try and work something out.

Where do I even go from here? I will not compromise on Mittens and I don't think my GF will compromise either.

Edit: wow, this completely blew up while I was asleep. I am trying to read every comment but there are a lot. Also, please allow me to take this moment to reiterate that my GFs views are not representative of those held by the wider vegan community!!"
cdzjre,My [33M] fiancée [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?,28630,0.95,1351,2019-07-16 22:13:46,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdzjre/my_33m_fiancée_27f_chose_to_save_my_deceased/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdzjre/my_33m_fiancée_27f_chose_to_save_my_deceased/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Two nights ago, my fiancée accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

Tl;dr: my fiancée had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. How do I repay her?"
bi38sa,My(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay.

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. She told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this. I'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. I love both of them very much and I'd like to help diffuse this situation. Can I get some advice here?"

I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn’t turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for “teaming up” with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible “prank” on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I’m Jewish. She didn’t believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my “dirtiness” which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn’t say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that “you people are all the same”. After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I’ve never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn’t go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn’t know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well 


**TL;DR Told her, broke up with her.**"
h9bwuh,"My wife lied about having a miscarriage and instead had an abortion, I don’t know what to do know?",28409,0.89,2115,2020-06-15 13:42:44,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h9bwuh/my_wife_lied_about_having_a_miscarriage_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h9bwuh/my_wife_lied_about_having_a_miscarriage_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,,False,"
My wife and I have been married for 3 years and for the past year we have been trying for a child. 

We both wanted to have children and after we got married we decided to first buy a house and get things in order financially before having children.
Last year we both mutually agreed that we were in the right place to try for a child, in fact it was my wife who put the idea forward.

A little over 8 months ago my wife found out she was 6 weeks pregnant with our first child. I was elated, I had always wanted to be a father and it seemed like something I never thought was possible was coming true. 
My wife and I began buying parenting books, planning a nursery, just doing all the stuff first-time parents do. I had never been happier at this moment.

Several weeks later, I had to fly out of the country for a work conference. I was gone for about 8 days. Whilst I was abroad, my wife called, she was crying and told me she had a miscarriage. She was 18 weeks pregnant at this point.
I flew back home immediately and told work that I had a family emergency. 
I was devastated with the news, but I never properly mourned as I felt I had to be emotionally strong for my wife who was a wreck.

This was a tough period for both of us, but I thought we had come out stronger as a couple. I knew I had to give my wife some time and space before we could approach the subject again, especially with this being, what I thought, her first miscarriage.

However, a week ago, a friend of my wifes called and told me she had something important to tell me. Apparently my wife had scheduled an abortion, whilst I was away at a conference. My wife’s reasoning being that she wasnt ready to be a parent.  My wife also said  didn’t want me to know about the abortion because I was so excited to be a parent and she didn’t want to hurt me.

At first I didn’t believe this to be true but after confronting my wife she told me that yes she had in fact aborted our child. 

I’m in shock right now. I’m hurt, angry and upset. I just don’t understand why she didn’t just speak to me about it. Maybe we could have talked this through, but right now I’m so mad that she went behind my back and led me to believe she lost our child. I understand that my wife is the one carrying the child, and at the end has the right to make any decision she wants, but why lie about the whole situation.   

I don’t know whether to carry on with the relationship or not. I love my wife but this is a huge betrayal to me, and I can’t even look at her right now. She’s currently crying and begging me to forgive her, I’ve just gone down to the spare bedroom and locked myself inside. Please someone just tell me what to do.


Edit: I did not expect this post to blow up like this. 
My emotions are all over the place and I’m a mess right now but once everything is sorted i will try and update you on the situation.
Thank you for you support

Right before our honeymoon, we bought a house together in VA, and after we got back, pooled our remaining money and time to completely redo her old starter home in MD and sold that in early 2019. 

We both work full time jobs in Virginia. I make pretty good money, she makes even better money. My wife, let’s call her Katie, decided to pursue an MBA and started last fall. She had an educational trust that her parents started for her, and therefore didn’t ask me for any financial assistance. However, because I saw how time consuming the MBA was on top of her already large professional workload, I took it upon myself to take care of everything related to our still relatively new home - including dealing with contractors, managing all our bills, maintaining the house, taking care of our dog, purchasing/assembling furniture, yard work, cooking, cleaning, laundry, and hosting/entertaining her family that insisted on coming over at least 2 weekends every month. 

Lately, Katie had been unhappy with our relationship, complaining that I wasn’t spending enough quality time with her and not making her feel wanted. I tried to argue several times that between her work and studies, and my work and home responsibilities, that there simply wasn’t very much time to spend together in general (we would frequently not even get to eat dinner until 9:00 or 10:00 at night, and I would either need to bring her a meal to her home office, or we would quickly eat together, and she would return to schoolwork to study or percolate in group projects/session). She would argue back that the things I was doing around the house were simply my responsibility as a husband, and that while she “appreciated it,” it didn’t count towards me trying to maintain or build our relationship. We’d also been arguing a lot about other things, and combined with the lack of free time, would be intimate maybe once a month. 

But after one particularly emotional (and drunken) conversation - about 3 or 4 weeks ago now - I vowed that despite what I already thought was prioritizing her needs, that I would go even further. I began to take off work (I, unlike her, still had to go in during Covid), or go in late/leave early, stopped seeing friends, skipped workouts, and would even wait until she was occupied with something else to even take a shower, all so I could spend as much available time as possible with her between her obligations. As a result, things seemed to be slightly improving between us. 

And now we arrive at last Wednesday. As per usual, I was making dinner for us. We have a tablet in the kitchen that I primarily use for recipes. As I was finishing up, the tablet began pinging nonstop, and I checked out what was happening. As it turns out, the tablet is linked to her google credentials, and I first saw an ongoing hangouts conversation between Katie and a friend, discussing what to do about “someone’s wife” who had come to our house that day while I was at work. Scrolling through the conversation history, I found more about Katie’s lack of feelings for me, and the longing and dreaming to instead be with some guy, who we’ll call Luke. 

Physically shaking at this point, I decided to venture away from Hangouts and open her Gmail, where I found several emails, going as far back as March, between her and Luke, calling each other “babe,” “sweetheart,” and “my love.”

Unsure about what to do next, I first took screenshots of everything I could find, then stepped outside to call the only person with law experience that I knew, an executive at my company who I’d become friends with. He advised that I immediately confront her, but first call someone to come over to the house to act as a witness, in case things became physical, or if she might later try to claim they did. So I had a friend over in about 20 minutes, I confronted Katie, and she confessed to the relationship and admitted that they had been intimate several times over the past 4 months, both at hotels and in our home. 

Now completely distraught, I tried to maintain my composure, and asked her to leave. She stayed at a hotel for two nights, then despite my protest, came home on Friday, stating this was her house too. She insisted on talking when she returned, and not having a witness this time, I decided to record the entire conversation on my phone. She tried to reiterate that she had been unhappy, but despite that, had been reaching out to her friends and mother about suggestions and resources she could use to help our relationship (even though I had suggested counseling in the past, but she refused). She tried to tell me that she made a mistake, that she had already broken it off with Luke a week ago, that I was the only person she wanted to spend her life with, and the only reason she hadn’t told me about it was because her friends had advised her not to. She also said that if we truly love each other, that divorce was a mistake, and that we should be able to get through anything. I replied that love is worthless without trust, and then said that if she insists on staying here, to please stay in the guest room. Obviously free usage of her home office and the guest bathroom, but to please stay out of our bedroom/bathroom unless telling me first. 

So now I’m here. Sitting in my house alone with just my dog. Her and her aunt/uncle/cousins are currently at our neighbors house for a bbq (they don’t know about what she did). I can’t bear to go over there because I don’t want to talk to or even look at Katie, much less pretend in front of a bunch of people that nothing happened. 90% of me wants to get a divorce, but despite her feelings, I was very happy with the life we were building. We had even been talking about being pregnant by this time next year. But no matter what I decide to do, I know I don’t want to make that decision without getting more information about what I can do, what might end up happening if we proceed, and I definitely want to talk to a few VA lawyers to protect myself. We only have one joint account with less than $20k in it, and the only asset we share is our house. 

So that’s it. I’m sorry for writing so much. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. And I would really appreciate any and all insight, suggestions, or advice. I just feel completely destroyed, empty, and alone. Please help me.

Edit: I am absolutely stunned and overwhelmed by the level of support you all have shown me. I truly can’t believe that all of would take the time to offer your advice, kindness, and wisdom to an absolute stranger. I am doing my best to read every one of your replies, and from the bottom of my somewhat shattered heart, thank you. This has been an unbelievable light in the darkest time of my life."

Short update because I’m supposed to be working. And I don’t expect this to get attention because my original post didn’t but I don’t know who else to tell. 

The day after I posted originally, I told her I’m in love with her, and asked her on a “real date”. It went well. Really well, so easily and just good. And she slept next to me again that night.. I got to kiss her in public! She said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

I am going to take everyone’s advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but I want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. Because everything just makes sense now. 

And yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

EDIT- because people keep asking, we’ve done paternity testing and this is absolutely my baby."

I’m disgusted.  It was her ex, whom I’ve always felt inferior too like she just hadn’t gotten over him even after over a year.

I’m distraught.  I don’t even have anyone else in my life rn.  My two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into Uni and i have only really “clicked” with one guy friend.  My family and I don’t even get along nor communicate much.  I lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

She’s REALLY sorry.  I saw her crying when she didn’t know I could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  I feel bad but like the lying and deception isn’t new.  I had to do it.  I told her we’re over, but she’s welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

But FUCK this sucks.  I have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and I just don’t know how to cope with this.  I can’t eat.  I can’t sleep and I have class in the morning.  I keep picturing the texts and visualizing him “pounding” her and I’m just disgusted.  I’m just obsessing over it and it’s 4 am in the fucking morning.

Part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  I know in a while I’ll be ok but I just don’t know how to get from part a to part b.

Please help




EDIT:  Wow.  I don’t even know what to say.  Guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  I get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

I finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  I woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  Thank you so much.  Reddit is such a beautiful place.  In the strangest way, I feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  You guys definitely played a part in that.

This is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  Keep up being great in life guys :)

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!


EDIT2:  Jesus guys!  You’re all a blessing!  I just finished class and I’ve been getting notifications every three seconds!  Going to do my best to get back to everyone.

I am doing much, much better.  I’m feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  Thank you all.

By far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  I’m going to dinner rn but I’m hitting the iron directly after!

On top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, I’ve had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching SAT Prep was praised for “outstanding qualifications”

-  I got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that I’ve been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

I’m doing well, thank you all, you’re all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you’re all worth a platinum in my eyes!

Cheers!

I did it guys :)

My mom married his dad.

So a few weeks ago in a morning I noticed my stuff in my room had moved. I told my brother (big bio brother, 23) and he didn’t take me seriously but taught me how to record my room at nights with my phone. I’ve been recording myself every night and nothing happened, so I was ready to believe that nothing had happened that night.

This weekend however, step brother came into my room at about 3:15am. He came to me with scissors, cut a small piece of my hair and left my room. It was so weird and shocking. It was a very small amount, something I likely wouldn’t have noticed. I sent the video to my siblings (brother and bio sister, 19). They told me to pack a bag immediately and picked me up and took me with them. They sent the video to parents.

Parents questioned step brother and he says he doesn’t remember doing it at all and said he was likely sleep walking and asked to see a doctor. I don’t believe him and neither do my siblings. 

Parents want to solve this problem by taking both of us to family therapy. They want me to come home and discuss this (all four of us). They say I’m not in any real danger, as he didn’t hurt me or do anything inappropriate or sexual. My siblings strongly disagree and say what he did was very inappropriate and they’re not going to let me go back there as long as step brother still lives there. Parents say they will install a lock on my door so that I can lock myself in at nights. 

Step father is upset at my siblings and claims they’ve turned this into a much larger issue than it is, he says they could have just parented the problem away by punishing and it’s not a big deal.

Honestly I keep hearing everyone with strong opinions about this and I don’t know who’s right or wrong. What should I do? Do I go back? Do I just never go back? My best friend says I should just go to the police and press charges against step brother.

tldr: Step brother snuck into my room at night and cut a small piece of my hair with scissors. I’m now staying with siblings and parents want me back, siblings want me to stay and I don’t know what to do."

I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

Edit : forgott to add. I have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

**little update/edit:** thank you guys you really helped me out. Yesterday was a bad day and you helped me get clarity. I've had a chat with our doctor who will now be handling this with us. I would like to thank most of you with useful advice and hopefully I will be able to update good news someday.

Edit: the mom was told that I’m undetectable and what that means, but she’s too overwhelmed with fear to really listen and comprehend. 

For the last two months, my(28f) boyfriend (28m) have been staying with his mom during quarantine. I have my own home with roommates and so does he but she insisted we stay with her temporarily to more easily adhere to social distancing.

I am HIV positive, and my boyfriend is aware. My boyfriend is HIV negative. I’m undetectable, which means there is so little amount of virus in my body that I cannot transmit the virus to anyone else. I cannot infect another person, even through unprotected sex. If you aren’t aware of how this happens, people with HIV can take antiretrovirals to basically fight the virus and protect your white blood cells from being attacked so the virus is unable to replicate. A lot has changed over the decades.

A little background: I have been HIV positive since I was 15 years old. I have a lot of trauma associated with my status. The person who gave it to me was an adult who was extremely abusive. This person beat and raped me regularly and held my HIV status over my head as a way to control me and keep me in the relationship. For years, I felt unlovable and dirty. It took A LOT of work and therapy to overcome my own personal shame towards my status. I don’t tell anybody about my status unless they have to know – like they’re medical professionals or if I’m sleeping with someone. My family knows, but none of my friends do. Not even my closest ones. I was so afraid of the stigma of my status that it changed the trajectory of my entire life. I was suicidal for years and stayed in lots of bad relationships because I was worried nobody better would love me. I’m doing better now. I’m in a healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. I’m back in school, working on my career. I’m stable and independent. I’m turning my life around I’m doing a good job at it.

Well, my boyfriend’s mom found my medication. I had a pill bottle in my purse in the closet. She claims she found a pill on the floor and saw a bag sticking out of my purse and thought she would put it there. The medication was in the bag and that’s how she found it.

If I’m honest, I don’t buy her story. My medication is extremely expensive and I’ve always had dogs so I’ve always paid close attention to making sure I don’t drop any pills or leave them around. After a decade of taking medication every day, I know to pay close attention to how I get the pills out of my bottle. I never just pour them out into my hand. Even if I did actually drop a pill, I would think the normal reaction would be to set it aside on a counter or bring it directly to one of us, not go into my purse. Either way, she went through my purse and it feels like a huge invasion of privacy. I’m not sure what she was even doing in the closet to begin with. I really think she was just snooping.

Anyways, instead of coming to me or my boyfriend, she told his sister. And then his sister told her husband and their other sister. Now the whole family knows my HIV status. The mom apparently reacted with things like, “How could she do this to herself?” and “Was she not raised properly?” She’s always been judgmental towards me, but this is victim blaming at its finest. She was worried that I gave it to her son but he took a test in front of them and he is negative. His sisters are apparently not judging me for it, but his mom definitely thinks lesser of me. 

I’m so angry that I’m being judged for something that I didn’t do to myself, especially since I’ve handled it responsibly. I’m angry that she went through my stuff. I’m angry that they spread my private medical information through the whole family. There is so much trauma associated with my status and I feel like I like the control of this information has been taken from me.

His mom is divorced and I understand that she was scared for her son and didn’t have someone to talk to about it and that’s why she spoke with the sister, but she should have gone to my boyfriend directly. His mom was a nurse so she should know better than to spread people’s private medical information around. His sister also had no reason to tell the other sister. This my private medical information. My medical history and our sex life is none of their business.

As soon as I learned what she did, I packed my things and left without saying a word to her. I love my boyfriend and according to him, he stood up for me when talking to his mom and sister, but I don’t know what to do from here. His family is EXTREMELY close. They all talk every day and spend a lot of time together.  I don’t want to see them, but I’m going to have to at some point. And I don’t want to feel like I’m the “girlfriend with HIV” forever. 

I feel sick to my stomach and I’ve been crying every day. What do I do? What should I expect from my bf?


Side note: I have a virtual therapy appointment next week, so if you’re going to suggest therapy, I’m way ahead of you.

EDIT TO UPDATE: I just wanted you all to know that last night while he was sleeping, I took my dog Daisy and left my boyfriend in the middle of the night. I am at a safe location, staying with Family, and have been in contact with the police trying to get an intervention order so I can me and my dog safe from him. Thank you all so very much for your support and concern. You have all saved my life!! I tried to make an update post but it kept getting removed! Thank you again 


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about a year now and for the most part he’s been absolutely wonderful and I love him so much. 

We have a pretty intense sex life and I’m usually really chill with that!!  
However recently he’s been taking it a lil too far, like I love choking and spanking in the bedroom, but he’s started doing it in public. Like today we took our dog to the park and I said or did something he didn’t like and he spanked me!! I was shocked!

Later on in the day we were doing the deed and he started to choke me, again which I usually like. It got to a point where I properly couldn’t breath so I used our signal to stop and he just looked down at me said I’m not gonna stop because I’m in the mood to kill you. He must have seen the fear in my eyes or something and he immediately let go and like cradled me and said sorry. I thought it was just him being in the moment so I let it go. 

But it happened a second time, he was just like staring at me and was whispering sweet things to me and then it took a turn to, you’re mine forever, never gonna let you go, I’ll kill you if you leave. I recoiled cause it made me uncomfortable and he like ticked me and told me it was just a joke. 

Like I love this man but like wtf.... how do I bring this up with him?? Tbh I’m tempted to leave.... 
We both don’t have dark senses of humour so I don’t know where this came from. 

How do I address this?? What should I say?"

He detested exercise, stayed a low rank at his career because he put in minimum effort, and we bonded more over activities like watching movies together at home rather than going out.

He went on this camping trip with his friends two years ago, and did shrooms (he had never done drugs before, and had he consulted me I would've told him that was a terrible idea), and when he came home, it was like something had lit a fire under his butt. He completely changed interests - he never played video games again and took up running, reading books even though I'd never seen him read before except for school, and several other completely random hobbies. He became a vegetarian even though, before, he'd been a meat and potatoes guy. He worked harder at his job, then did an accelerated grad school program and ended up making tons more money.

I barely recognize him. We still have a good marriage, and I still love him, and he has motivated me to be better in the last two years, but....I can't help but wonder if those drugs knocked a screw loose. Could this be dangerous? I'm deeply concerned. I know that people change, but about all that's left of him is his warm heart. No one shares my concerns because all his changes have been positive, but I feel like he's so different maybe we need marriage counseling so I can adapt, at least...

&#x200B;

Edit:

Wow, this blew up. Thank you all, I'm still trying to read all your responses - I will read them all. I think some additional context is required: this personality change has required more than adapting to my husband becoming a new person. Our lives are very different, now. Before, we saw our friends once a week and mostly hung out around the house. Now, we are extremely social, and to put our exercise habits in perspective, we got a high energy border collie and she gets the amount of daily exercise the vet recommended. I've been caught up in a whirlwind of change I didn't expect, and it's just a lot to process, but don't get me wrong - I am proud of my husband.

I posted here to get outside perspective, and have been given lots of advice to research psychedelics. I am in the process of finding sources of information that I consider unbiased, and am looking into it. I stand by that anyone would be concerned if their husband came home from a camping trip with a different personality and completely changed their lifestyle, but I'm calming down about it.

I think I might have enough perspective from posting here to address this with my husband, now. We've talked about it, before, but I've been reluctant to voice my concerns because he's doing so well and I felt it would come off as criticism. It's possible I stewed on this for so long it became a bigger issue to me than it actually was. I think I'm going to suggest that I pursue individual therapy for a while, since hundreds of people have pointed out that the problem is with me and not him or our relationship."

We’ve been married for 6 years and have 2 kids I’m pregnant with a third. 

My husband works from 9-5, comes home, does his chores, plays with our 2 kids, talks to me for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. But he doesn’t seem to enjoy doing any of it. Like this whole thing is one big chore. 

He used to be this goofy guy who smiled and told jokes all the time, but I haven’t seen the man smile in months. 

It’s not like he’s neglecting his duties as a husband and father, but he acts like it’s just that, duties. Like hanging with the kids and me is a second job. 

I’m grateful for all he’s doing, and he makes all of our lives sooo much easier, but it’s like he’s constantly on the clock and I think he might be depressed. 

I tried asking him if he was doing ok and he tells me he’s doing “fantastic”, but I know he’s not. That’s the line he uses at work when customers try to make small talk and ask how he’s doing. 

He doesn’t take anytime for himself. He doesn’t take any breaks, he stopped playing games and stopped watching tv. He just does what I feel he thinks needs to be done and I don’t know how to help him out. 

Our sex life has become one sided. We do it frequently but only because I initiate frequently. Even if he doesn’t seem in the mood he’ll do it. Like it’s his responsibility to “make me happy.” It feels like he isn’t there in the moment, like his mind is wandering the whole time we’re intimate and that, to me, feels worse than getting rejected. 

I don’t know what’s going on, and I don’t know how to help because he won’t let me in. To anybody else he seems fine, but I know something is wrong and I don’t know how to fix this. 

I miss my husband, the guy who complained, and told jokes. Not this robotic shell that looks like him. 

Edit: Alright, wow! I didn’t expect this to blow up. I want to thank you all for your advice; I really appreciate it. It’s clear to me now that my husband is overworked and “burnt out.” 

He comes home from work in a couple hours and I’m going to sit him down and talk to him.  I’m going to tell him how I feel, and I hope that together we can find a solution that turns him back into the man he once was. 

I’m sorry if wasn’t able to respond to everyone, but I want you all to know I read every comment and response. 

I’ll post an update soon about how it goes.

The whole situation still feels surreal. I have gone from being angry at him to being angry at myself. I have written long texts to him and then deleted them completely. I have gone through stages of denial where I thought that Jason, being such a good guy, may not have actually done anything wrong? Maybe a woman gaslighted him into feeling that he had committed a crime when she consented at the time?

Then I realized that everyone who commented on my last post hit the nail squarely on the head. He didn't go to the police to turn himself in for what he did. If he truly felt remorse, that is what he would have done. His charm and natural ""understanding"" of women's problems were complete ruses; many people with sociopathic tendencies are great with people. Most of all, he gets to cry and move on with his life. He gets to love another woman again. His victim? I can't even fathom what she's going through.

I finally called him two nights ago. He wanted to talk about how we could mend our relationship, but after two weeks of not hearing his voice and being scared of how I may run back to him, it hit me like a truck: I don't love him anymore. I told him that I wanted him to vacate his apartment for three hours while I gathered my belongings. He said he would do so. I ended the call by telling him that if he felt any remorse, he would go to the police and accept all charges for what he did, not contest them in court, and take his punishment. He started talking about how that wouldn't bring justice to his victim. Then he said that he loved me. Twisted fuck.

I showed up the next morning at the decided time with my sister, he was nowhere to be seen. I'm confident he won't contact me again.

Thank you all so much for helping me through this. I'm going to find a therapist as soon as possible.

TL;DR: my rapist boyfriend won't turn himself in, and I broke up with him. I safely gathered my belongings and now I'm living with my sister.

Edit: **I apologize for editing the post, but after receiving a couple of private messages asking me to drop his personal information, I must make one thing clear: I will not, under any circumstances, post any identifying information about him. It is not only against sitewide rules, but if I were reckless enough to do that, he could sue me. Again, I repeat: nobody is getting his information. He is a monster. He probably deserves worse.

When I was about 14, my mother asked me if I would be willing to help her have a baby one day. I said yes without understanding what it all entailed. She is still holding me to this even though I have since changed my mind. 

My mom has been threatening to kick me out over my refusal. She is pressuring me to sign a contract that would bind me to one cycle sometime before I turn 30 and she has even discussed me carrying a baby for her once I'm done with school. I feel very nervous about this and I'm trying to stall/hold out until I am no longer under her roof. I can't afford to move out (Eta: until August). I'm not sure if I could eventually get out of this contract if I were to sign it, but I don't want to risk it. Her fiance is totally cool with this. I don't know what to do.

I'm trying to make plans to maybe stay with a friend, but I'm hoping to find a way out of this with my personal items. I know my mom will hold things hostage so to speak. 

Sorry if this isn't the right sub.

We don’t have children. Due primarily to a string of horrible jobs that led to some pretty bad anxiety issues for her, we agreed last year that she could stop working and pursue whatever hobbies, activities etc. that she wanted while I provided for us financially. 

As part of this, she agreed to take care of basically everything related to the home - cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping and so on. I still handle a couple items, really just the garbage and the lawn. Beyond that it’s all her, and she does a great job. Coming home to a clean house and a fresh meal from a wife who’s happier than I’ve seen her in years is wonderful. She’s also able to keep herself looking even hotter than usual which is definitely fun for us both lol

Anyway that’s the arrangement we have currently, and I think it’s more than fair (as does she) - our house isn’t big at all so we’re talking maybe 2-3 hours a day max to stay on top of everything. Might be temporary as she recharges and develops new skills/interests, or it could be permanent. I’m fine with either one, it’s up to her.

She had some friends over the other evening, I was playing games in my office. I came out to grab a drink and overheard her friends commenting on our situation. They were saying it wasn’t fair that my wife had to do everything, I should be pitching in more, what is this the 1950s, shit like that. 

Ok whatever, I disagree but they can talk. Doesn’t affect me. I come out again later to get something and these “guests” actually start straight up scolding me. Same nonsense as before, I’m lazy, I need to do this and that blah blah. My wife clearly didn’t agree or intend for this to happen but was too embarrassed to say anything.

They end their rant with one of them saying “You both make messes, why should she be the only one cleaning them up?”

I probably should have just said it was none of their business and been done with it, but I was pissed and wanted to show how dumb that question was. So I responded:

“We both need money, why should I be the only one making it?”

They didn’t say much after that so I went back into my office, they left a short time later. I finish up in there and find my wife still in the living room, crying. I go to comfort her, thinking it was just out of embarrassment from what happened. But she said that what I said hurt her a lot. It sounded like I didn’t think she did enough and wanted her to go back to work.

I tried to explain that it was just a rhetorical question to make a point but she’s still upset. How can I reassure her that I’m happy with our arrangement and appreciate everything she does?"

First of all, I'd like to say thank you for those who gave me really solid advice in my last post. A lot has happened in the last few days. Sorry I havent been replying to any of you, I just didnt think I was in the right headspace to actually hold a meaningful conversation. Rest assured I did read all of your replies. Even the really mean ones.

So where do I begin? We'll I think some of you would be delighted to know that he left me for not being supportive. Sucks to be me I guess. I guess you guys were right, I am a sucky girlfriend. He's now off to be with his brand new supportive GF.

Nah, just kidding but some of you wouldve wanted that to happen, right?

So heres what really happened...

After reading some of your comments, I started to see things from a different perspective. I never really thought of it as anything other than cheating, and it didnt help that when he came home to me that morning he claimed to have cheated on me and I guess my mind just started going to a dark place where logic goes out of the window. Its definitely not an excuse but I really wasnt in the right mindset after he said he cheated. I guess it was after the realization that this man would never willingly hurt me is when all the anger and pain of being cheated on was washed away.

I couldnt really bring myself to talk to him at first. He was on the couch blankly staring at whatever was on tv. He looked... empty. I sat beside him and told him I had no intentions of breaking up. Well, he came to life almost instantly and before I knew it, his arms were wrapped around me. He was shaking and I could tell he was crying. I was too. Remember when I said I felt my world was crumbling around me? Well for the first time in what seemed like forever, I could feel it starting to fall back into place. I didnt realize how much a simple embrace can be so calming. Everything was starting to feel right again.

Then we talked. He apologized again for cheating and when I told him I didnt think he cheated, he had a puzzled look on his face. I asked him if he gave consent and he said no. I tried to explain I guess he still doesnt realize that he was actually taken advantage of. He said the first thing that came to mind after what happened was that he cheated and was so afraid of losing me.

This man, after being raped, first thought of how much he betrayed me instead of how he was betrayed himself. I was floored. He said his first response had to be to win me back, which is why he's been going the extra mile the last few days taking care of me from a distance.

When it was my turn to speak, I told him how sorry I was for not being supportive. I jumped to conclusions without actually thinking about it clearly, which was pretty out of character for me.

A few more exchanges after that and the conversation shifted to Max and HM. I told him that I never wanted him anywhere near Max or her again and he agreed. I've always thought he was a bad influence but I never thought he'd take it this far so I never stopped him from seeing his (ex) best friend. He showed me his phone which didnt have a lock anymore. He said he blocked both of them on everything but wanted to keep the open phone policy. He said its so I can be sure he isnt back in touch with Max.

I urged him to file a police report but he was against it. He said that even if he was raped, he couldnt bring himself to do it. I didnt really know about it at first but his family and Max's family had a very long history of friendship. Their moms were college best friends and their dads work together. Not only were the two of them close, even their families were close. I thought they were just neighbors but it was more than that. I didnt know cause every time I visit his family, the topic was never brought up and I havent really met any of Max's family except for his little sister who came by to play with BF's little brother. He said he didnt want to ruin decades of friendship and would be content with just going NC with Max.

He's getting tested later today and I hope that bitch didnt give my man anything. I'm also pretty confident my BF didnt get HM pregnant cause Max absolutely hates children so Id imagine HM would be on BC given how many dudes she sleeps with.

BF and I came to the conclusion that Max most likely set the whole thing up to break us apart so he can have his best friend back. They used to be partners in crime after all, when it came to parties and picking up women. I would like to point out that I did not force him to change. He himself chose to do so but I know he did it for me, which just makes me fall in love with him even more. When we first met he was still the playboy party animal he was but he told me after hanging out with me for a few weeks that he didnt really feel like sleeping around anymore. I didnt really believe him at first, obviously. I've also noticed that a few people were bashing me for making him wait 1 year for sex. I'm sorry, I just have different views. I believe that sex is for people who love each other, so I wasnt willing to sleep with anyone I wasnt deeply in love with and didnt love me back. I dont judge people who sleep around. My BF has a high body count but I dont really hold it against him but back then, I just wanted to be sure I wasnt just a girl he bangs or a ""conquest"" but someone who he actually loves and sees a future with. Considering his past, I was very skeptical for a while and I had my walls up the entire time but he slowly tore them apart and I'm glad he did. That reluctant yes when he first asked me out was and still is one of the best decisions Ive ever made.

Max's plan had the opposite effect. Its rough now but I can see this experience making our relationship even stronger. I love him more than ever believe it or not and Im sure he feels the same way. The last few days have taught us both how shitty our lives would be without the other. I guess it made us value each other more? Not that either of us took the other for granted.

And yes, we are both getting therapy. Both individually and as a couple. To be honest, Im still shaken over the whole thing. Even when we cuddle, I can still imagine HM having her way with him and I cant help but cry about it. If Im still shaken up by the whole thing, I can only imagine how much worse it is for him but I'll be there for him every step of the way.

I know he didnt cheat.

I know he wont break my heart.

I know that I love him.

Its hard right now but knowing those facts makes me confident we can see this through. One redditor pointed out that we were soulmates and I like to think that we are. I cant see myself being with anyone but him.

Thanks again for all your advice and for making me see things differently. I'll try to reply and answer questions when necessary and when I can."

I got a lot of good feedback and you guys are right; I did let my temper get the best of me in front of her on multiple occasions and that makes me a bad boss.

I went to her office unsure of what to expect. The door was locked when I got there, so I stood outside waiting. She came up behind me and said my name. She asked me if I was ready to interview and I just said yes.

We sat down in her office and she pulled out her phone and started recording. She asked me if I minded being taped and I said no.

She asked me basic interview questions, and then she asked me if there was anything that I knew I had to work on. I told her that my temper was an issue in the past, but that I have had a sudden wake-up call about my temper and that I was actively working on it. I apologized for leaving her hanging with training and that I was glad to see she was in a better position.

She told me that one of the things she had learned was forgiveness. She had left the company she was at and rehired to because they had wronged her during the merger. When she was offered the position back, it was with an apology, a raise, and now she is in a better position than when she left. She said sometimes an apology can start you down the path towards something better.

She told me that she is willing to hire me for a good wage because she knew I was good at a lot of things at my previous job. She said if I lost my temper during the trial period, it would be the end, but she was hopeful that it wouldn't happen. She asked me if I could start Friday.

She started training me today, and I definitely realized I was the problem and why she didn't succeed where I was. She is absolutely wonderful at the job with great client interactions. She should've been able to easily pick up the work I was throwing at her if she had been properly trained. I'm glad that she gave the company a second chance because she deserves everything they have given her. I hope to learn a lot from her and show her that she didn't waste her time on me.

I've also signed up for therapy to manage my anger online.

TL;DR: I ate my humble pie and went to the interview. She is giving me a second chance and I hope to be a good employee. I'm starting anger management soon."
iy8jfi,I (31/m) am in a submissive relationship with my girlfriend (28/f) and I just realized she doesn't actually love me,27176,0.85,1816,2020-09-23 17:16:34,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iy8jfi/i_31m_am_in_a_submissive_relationship_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iy8jfi/i_31m_am_in_a_submissive_relationship_with_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"My girlfriend (of 1 1/2 years) and I follow an ""FLR"" which means female led relationship. It's basically a lifestyle fetish thing. Without being too specific I basically have dedicated my life to making her happy in a seemingly selfless way (it's not really selfless I guess because I enjoy it myself, but that's all I get from it). She controls all the finances, we only do stuff if she wants to do it, we never do what I want, sex is only for her, I do all the chores, etc. The whole relationship is basically about double standards that benefit her and that don't benefit me, to put it simply. But that's just how our relationship is. I've struggled with it at times but I enjoy it overall.

I have a sciatica issue with my back. It's normally not a big deal but over the weekend I seriously screwed it up. It was totally agonizing and I had to go to the hospital. My girlfriend was completely unsupportive and didn't care about me at all. She told me to power through the pain but I was like rolling around in pain almost. It was clearly impossible. I called her by her first name by accident and she yelled at me for being disrespectful. I had to drive myself to the hospital because she wouldn't let me use the phone. She was just completely annoyed about the whole thing. I think she told me that she hopes I catch the virus but I wasn't sure. I was out of it as I was leaving the house. They gave me some muscle relaxers in the hospital and I'm doing better now, but I'm trying not to exert myself too much until the disk completely goes back into place.

Also, while she does sometimes treat me badly as part of the ""role"", she didn't seem to be doing that here. I mean she knew it was serious, and I think she just revealed exactly how she felt. I always thought that even though we had this relationship, that she did actually care about me. But because of the way our relationship was, it didn't come out much. She loved me in her own way, I thought. But these last days, I realized that she actually just views me as a literal servant. She doesn't care about me as a person, only as submissive partner. Even calling it a partnership doesn't make sense.

Maybe this is the wrong place to post this but I wanted to get a vanilla perspective with people that have normal, healthy relationships. Am I overthinking this? Do you think I might be able to make the relationship work long-term? And if you have dabbled in d/s stuff I'd be curious to hear if any of you have had similar experiences. Thanks."
i7zimx,My antivax mom started crying after I said I didn't want to associate with anti-vax protesters and threatened not to help me pay for college if I got a flu shot.,27010,0.91,2268,2020-08-12 02:03:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7zimx/my_antivax_mom_started_crying_after_i_said_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7zimx/my_antivax_mom_started_crying_after_i_said_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So, to preface, I (17F) am an incoming freshman in college. I'm going to a UC (won't say which for obvious reasons), but I got into the school's semi-competitive engineering program and it was one of my top choices for college. I absolutely love the school. Unfortunately, the UC system just instituted a new rule that all students need to get a flu shot before they can attend. My mom (50F) has been incredibly upset about this for the past two days.

She called me up about an hour ago to talk about how I wanted to ""deal"" with the problem of having to get a flu shot.

She was asking me to reconsider going to another college halfway across the country because they don't require flu shots. The school is not nearly as good in terms of engineering, it's a long way away and it's expensive as hell for out of state students. I have zero desire to go there. I told her this wasn't the hill I wanted to die on, I don't think getting a flu shot is really that big of a deal and I certainly don't want it to be the reason I end up not going my top choice college.

She got kinda angry with me and basically implied that she wouldn't pay for me to attend college if I got the shot, I would be completely on my own.

Then she said, ""Why don't you march your protester self (I organized a BLM march in our city back in June, so she's referencing that) down to city hall. I'm sure you can find people who will protest with you.""

And I responded, ""I'm not sure I want to associate with those people,"" which I know was super mean and sounds awful to me in hindsight. She started crying and hung up on me after I said that.

My mom and I seem to be at odds about everything right now. She was upset with me for organizing the BLM march, she doesn't like most of my political views, and she's even threatened to burn a book I was reading by Richard Dawkins about evolution because ""he advocated for cannibalism"" (???) and she seems to vaguely think evolution is a lie, despite not be religious so far as I can tell.  I also had to get a series of vaccinations in ninth grade to attend my high school, which my dad took me to get and which my mom is still extremely upset about almost four years later. I feel like this whole disaster is going to be the final straw though.

I just really need some advice on how to deal with this before she comes home from work and gets super mad and starts yelling at me.

Edit: Okay, I just want to add because people keep suggesting this, I can't exactly go behind her back here and get the shot on my own. Like, physically yes I can walk to Walgreens and get it. But being allowed to go to college = got the flu shot. She will know, and therein lies the problem. Also, I know my mom sounds kinda bad on paper (or ""on Reddit"") but she really is a loving and caring person who is attempting to look out for me in her own way, so please stop with the name-calling. I came here asking for help, not asking you to shit on my mom. It's just not helpful or productive. Thanks.

Edit 2: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading every single one of your comments. I want to answer everyone's questions, but that might take a while as I'm still working out how to deal with this situation with my dad. Thanks to the people who have been helpful, supportive, and encouraging with their advice. I'll update soon."

I am 5”4’ and 125lbs. He pursued me. Slowly he keeps making more and more negative comments about my appearance. 

He made me a workout and eating plan and constantly asks if I follow it. He basically wants me to go vegan. Honestly I’m not into the vegan lifestyle and I don’t eat horrible. When we order in yesterday I got baked ziti. He looked at me and said how could I be ordering this when we both agreed I need to lose weight.

Everytime I try to dump him over this, he tells me I don’t understand where he is coming from. He told me I’m average and he wants me to stand out. That he noticed I have low self esteem and he is trying to make me confident and be happy with myself. Everyday he asks me if I did my work outs. 

He will send me photos of other girls and say if I follow what he says I will look like that. He REALLY pursued me and now I feel like he’s killing my self esteem. Why pursue someone so hard if you aren’t that attracted to them? He told me if I lose fifteen pounds I’ll be perfect.

He sends me pictures of women who have post pregnancy bodies or not good bodies at all and he tells me that they are like me, that they are chubby and not curvy. Or he will send me pictures of girls I don’t consider pretty and say if I listen to him I will look like that, I just need to lose weight. I tell him I think I’m thinner than those girls and he tells me that he has better eyes. 

Honestly at this point I don’t want to break up because I feel no one will find me attractive. I feel like I want his approval. I’ve been wearing baggy clothes because I’m so ashamed of my body. I use to like my body but now I’m ashamed.

Why is he dating me if I’m so unattractive? How do I gain my self esteem back? Why pursue me?

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming response. I can’t get back to everyone, but I appreciate each and every message. Honestly I didn’t realize my situation was that bad, I am going to assume he had me under control. This really was reassuring and I’m so happy I found this community and made this thread. I broke up with him over text message and explained to him how you talk and treat me is not how you talk to anyone let alone your girlfriend who you are suppose to love. That I hope he changes for the next girl he dates because he’s a miserable person and no one deserves his abuse. I blocked his number, I’m sure he might try to show up at my house, but I just felt the need to end it as soon as possible. I think I’m going to take some time for myself since my self esteem is still in the gutter, but thank you all 💕"
e4zu6s,My boyfriend [22M] spiked my [21F] drink the other night.,26781,0.87,2166,2019-12-02 20:01:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e4zu6s/my_boyfriend_22m_spiked_my_21f_drink_the_other/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e4zu6s/my_boyfriend_22m_spiked_my_21f_drink_the_other/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I’m full aware that I might be overreacting a little, but some outside opinions would help ease my mind either way.

So my boyfriend \[22M\] and I \[21F\] have been together for about 2 years now and currently share an apartment in our college town. I don’t drink. I don’t have a reason or anything, just never acquired a taste for alcohol. I’ll take a sip of my boyfriend or a friend’s drink just to try it every now and again, but I usually don’t like it. I go to bars with friends and hang out with them all the time, and I’ll usually just have a soda or a water and offer to drive if need be.

My boyfriend was a little stressed the other day since he had to work during Black Friday, so he was tired when he came home. We were watching something on Netflix when he gets up and says he’s going to make himself a drink. I offered to do it for him, but he just said “no no, don’t worry about it, I’ll bring you a water.” So he comes back with his drink and a flavored water for me, and when I sipped it, something tasted off about it. I only took a few more sips of it before I just put in on the coffee table and ignored it.

He asked me why I wasn’t drinking it, which was kind of a strange question to me. I told him it tasted a little off and maybe I bought a bad case or something. He immediately seems to get frustrated and tells me to just drink it so it doesn’t go to waste. Push came to shove, and turns out he put vodka in my water. When I asked him why he would do that without telling me, he said that it was a fantasy of his to have drunken sex with me, and it was “getting ridiculous” that I wouldn’t get drunk so we could do that. He has never communicated this to me before. I had no idea. I dumped my drink out into the sink, and then he was angry at me for wasting alcohol. Now, I’m scared. He put something in my drink without my knowledge, and that scared me. I’m not sure what to do now.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm realizing now that I am, in fact, under reacting. You guys are all right, I can't seem to stop thinking about this a few days after the fact, so that must mean something. I'm currently packing a bag before I head off to class in about an hour. I called a friend of mine and she is gonna meet me on campus after my class and I'm gonna stay with her until I can figure out where I'm staying for the remainder of the semester. Thank you all for knocking some proper insight into me. I seriously appreciate it.

EDIT AGAIN: Got out of class, currently with a trusted friend and heading over to her place. I tried calling my ""boyfriend"" with no answer, I'll handle that later. But, I'm feeling pretty apathetic about the whole situation right now. Though I'll admit that my friend got a good laugh out of me by saying ""you look like you need a fucking drink.""

**LAST EDIT:** It's the next day, and I'm logging in to find over 800 more comments and over 20 DMs. First of all, all the DMs have been super kind and I appreciate every single one of them. Seriously, thank you. Second of all, the comments here started to get a little controversial as to whether it was smart of me to leave or not. I mean, what's done is done, so it doesn't really matter now. Some people might disagree, but to me, a 2-year relationship is not very long, so I was no longer concerned about ""destroying a 2-year relationship.""

My friend and I went back to that apartment later last night because I decided I did want to talk to my (now ex-) boyfriend in person instead of over the phone. I know some people might not agree with me doing this, but again, what's done is done. I expressed why I left, I expressed that he lost my trust (and I did not accuse him of rape). My friend had no influence on this conversation, she remained silent the whole time. This is when he finally apologized. He followed it up by saying ""if you'd just have a drink like a normal adult-"" but he immediately took it back and apologized again. My name is not on the lease for the apartment, so I took the rest of my things, let him keep anything that was in the kitchen, and my friend and I left. There was no yelling, no harsh arguments, nothing. Just a clean cut-off. I'll go back home to my parents this weekend to explain everything and then I'll figure out where to live for the remainder of the school year. Thank you guys for giving me advice, and while I didn't respond to all of you, know that I do appreciate every opinion that was given here. As far as the status of whether this act will be reported or not, I have chosen not to share with the internet."

bkft0r,My gf was raped and became pregnant.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

I feel shit. Was i wrong?"

I (17m) and my girl (18f) have been dating since last November and started having sex in June. I always keep my condoms under my bed because nobody just goes snooping under my bed. Mid July my dog was under my bed and he took my condom box and ran out with it. I stopped him in the hallway and took them back but my mom had already seen it. She snatched it out of my hand & started yelling for my dad. He came, she held the box up and pointed at me, and they both looked so disappointed and I felt very ashamed. They ended up breaking me and my girlfriend up and stalk my every move to make sure we aren’t together. Although we’re not “together” anymore, I find ways around their blocks *when* I can. My parents have decided that COVID is a great opportunity to do some family bonding. They bought board games, made every Saturday movie night, and want everyone to take turns talking about their day. I often start studying so I am too busy to have to join. However sometimes they will force me to join. I just sit there silently or I don’t engage at all. I don’t mean to hurt their feelings- there just isn’t anything I want to say to them. My dad got angry a couple of days ago because of my silence with them. He screamed about how I haven’t had a real conversation with them in basically two months. I let him scream and I still stayed silent. Again, I just don’t have anything to say to them.. At all. However, my dad’s yelling did make me feel like a terrible kid for not speaking to them. I guess I should start talking to them, but I just don’t want to. I know that family is important and you should never hold grudges towards your family, but my feelings feel so set in stone that I don’t think I can bring myself to have a true conversation with them. Is there anyway I can just get over myself and speak to my parents?"
hdi6lt,My (28/f) dog growled at my niece (3/f) after she spent an entire evening harassing him. Now my brother (31/m) wants me to put the dog down.,26307,0.94,3568,2020-06-22 06:23:09,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hdi6lt/my_28f_dog_growled_at_my_niece_3f_after_she_spent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hdi6lt/my_28f_dog_growled_at_my_niece_3f_after_she_spent/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Hi everyone. I have fostered a multitude of dogs in my life, and dealt with a lot of behavioral problems--dog aggression, cat aggression, food aggression, separation anxiety, super high prey drives...I've seen it all, and I've certainly encountered my fair share of dogs who weren't safe around small children. So I feel extremely confident in saying my current 5 year-old lab mix is safe for kids. He's basically a gigantic teddy bear, and loves everyone.

However, it's always been my personal philosophy that dogs (and any other animal, really) should never be left alone with young kids, even if it's the sweetest, most mild-mannered dog in the world. The kids don't understand when they're pushing the dog past its limits, and the dog cannot reasonably be expected to put up with being harassed long after it's signaled that it would like to be left alone.

My niece has never been good with my dog. She pulls his tail, climbs on/lays on him, hits him, pulls his ears, gets in his face and yells at him, and never gives him a second to himself unless she's forced to. He is basically a saint with her, but every dog has its limits. I stay as on-top of this behavior as I can, forcing her to leave him alone when it starts to seem like too much, and locking him away in a bedroom if she won't. My brother and SIL (30/f) really just don't get it, though. I've tried to talk to them about this behavior a bunch of times, and they know it's wrong, but they think it's wrong in the same way that her refusing to share or not picking up her toys is wrong. They don't understand that it's *dangerous*, and that if she was left alone long enough, my dog might lose it and attack her. This has been going on for over a year, I've tried to have this conversation with my brother over and over, but he always acts like I'm criticizing his parenting. Which is not the case; I don't think my niece is especially bratty or out of control for a kid that age, it's just that this behavior is dangerous to both her and my dog, and it needs constant intervention. The same way that a small kid playing with the stove isn't especially bratty, it's just especially *dangerous*, and needs to be curbed ASAP. I even tried having a dog trainer friend explain this to him, and he still didn't get it. 

I've tried to come up with excuses for why we can never meet at my house for our family hangouts, but I couldn't think of one the other day, and my brother and niece came over. I was cooking dinner and not paying enough attention to make sure my dog was okay (which was absolutely my fault, and I accept responsibility). I asked my brother a few times to keep her away from my dog, but he kept saying she was fine. I did move my niece away from him a few times, but I wasn't vigilant enough, and my dog ended up getting to the end of his rope and growling at my niece.

I immediately grabbed my dog and brought him into my bedroom. I did not punish him at all; frankly, I'm glad that he signaled loud and clear that he was uncomfortable. I would never want to discourage him from doing that, because then next time, he'd skip the growling and go straight to attacking. I came out of the room, ready to talk to my brother about how *this* is what I've been talking about. But he was furious, yelled that my dog is a menace who should be put down, and left.

I completely understood his reaction. That's his daughter, and he was afraid for her, and nothing else mattered to him. But he hasn't calmed down at all since this happened, and won't talk to me except to say my dog needs to be put down and he won't be speaking to me until it's done. He's also tried to involve our parents, who said they will absolutely not be getting involved (they know my niece's behavior with my dog has been a problem in the past). I have not heard from my SIL at all, which makes me think she might agree with me. Knowing her personality type, I don't really think she'd sit out a fight like this if she thought my dog was dangerous.

The way I see it, this is solely my fault and my brother's fault. I shouldn't have allowed my niece to harass my dog; I knew what could happen, and I was more concerned about how upset my brother got when I tried to bring it up, than I was about my niece's safety. I should've just said my niece wasn't allowed around my dog until she got a bit older, and dealt with whatever fallout there was within my family. Similarly, my brother should've kept a better eye on his kid, and not been so defensive when I tried to explain the problem. My dog, on the other hand, put up with being harassed for over a year, and when he was finally pushed to his limits, signaled very loudly (and harmlessly) that he needed to be removed from the situation. He is not dangerous, and I will not put him down.

My brother is now saying that the entire family has sided with a dog over his child, which is not the case. It's just that there are lots of other solutions to this problem. I am perfectly happy to crate my dog when they come over, or leave him in another room, or just never have them over again and hang out somewhere else. There's no reason for my niece to ever see my dog again, and I'd be happy to talk over a solution with him. It's just that he won't talk to me at all, and I don't know what to do. Should I give him more time to cool off? Should I go over to his house and try to talk? I don't want to ruin this relationship, we are very close, but I'm just not putting my dog down over this.

Edit: You beautiful people of reddit. I’m overcome (and honestly overwhelmed) with the outpouring of comments and support and awards and DMs. I just got home from work and am crying but this is a good cry. It’s been a really awful year and yesterday was brutal but logging on to this has just been the most special thing. I promise to read all your comments and DMs but it’s going to take some time haha. People who spent their coins on awards — that’s very sweet of you and I’m surprised that you’d do that on a throwaway but I want you to know that it honestly touched my heart that strangers can be this caring about a nobody. I don’t feel alone like I did last night when I posted. THANK YOU. I still have no idea the best way to leave this situation but I’m definitely not signing up for a throuple which I made crystal clear to my husband at 4am. Also, my manager pulled me aside today and asked me if everything is okay because I obviously didn’t sleep and look super gross I think from the throwing up and not eating. I just told him what happened because I couldn’t think of a lie on the spot. He took me to his office and searched our legal Bar and legal help and divorce mediation and looked me dead in the eyes and said if I tell anyone at work he’ll deny it so then I broke down sobbing in his office which was really not my finest moment. So it turns out he has a soul and gave me Monday off in his words to “get yourself to a lawyer but keep it quiet from your husband”. So on Monday my husband will think I’m at work but I’ll be seeing what my next steps should be from a legal perspective. Speaking of my husband, I asked him to give me some space for the next few days and he’s on the couch. My best friend texted me a few times today but I’ve just left her on read. This was a long edit! I’m going to eat something and sleep now. Thank you for caring reddit. 

Okay, let me start out by saying fuck 2020. My husband lost his job in April, and has been home while I have been working extra shifts (making $12/hr) to keep us from going broke. Yes, I’ve been out of the house more than at home. Yes, I haven’t been super active in bed because I am really exhausted all the time from working 70 hours a week STANDING ON MY FEET all 70 hours. I thought he’d appreciate that I am working so we have things like food and a place to live. Instead he and my best friend have been fucking while I’ve been at work. She lost her job too. They’ve always gotten along with each other and I’ve never felt jealous or threatened that they have hung out together just the 2 of them over the years. One very drunk night in 2009 she and I did make out but it was a one time thing and I didn’t enjoy it. I thought I could trust them and that they were just friends. Obviously, I’m an idiot. 

Enough backstory. I came home tonight and found them snuggling on the couch watching tv. Like in a spooning position, but it was very obvious it was intimate. They didn’t panic, but she sat up. Then he sat up. At this point I felt my stomach turn into a rock and I felt dizzy. No word of a lie, my body went into some kind of shock? I just walked to the bathroom and closed the door and sat on the toilet. I just started crying after I have no idea how long. I threw up. I heard them whisper talking but couldn’t make out what they were saying, but then they knocked on the bathroom door and asked if I was ok, and I told them “obviously fucking not.” They didn’t backpedal or deny anything. They didn’t admit to fucking then, but my best friend said we should all probably talk about what’s going on. 

I stayed in the bathroom. We talked through the door. That’s when my husband said “ok, yes, we didn’t want you to find out like this, but we have been in a relationship since July.” He said some more things but I honestly can’t remeber them because my ears were kind of ringing? And I kept thing about him saying relationship. This wasn’t a fling or a one night stand. I could maybe forgive that but a real relationship? Isn’t marriage supposed to me mean just and I are in a relationship? So he says whatever and then my best friend says “so what do you think?” I missed everything he said obviously so I told her that and she said “so you missed the part about all three of us living together?” After me asking what? my husband clarified that she would stay on the couch but they’d keep each other company during the day and I could be with her too if I wanted (she knows I don’t want this because we would have made out more than that one time in 2009 right?) I know she needs to move out of her place because no job=no rent payment. I had told her in the past she could always crash at my place, but I never meant like this. How could she not know that? Is my best friend an idiot? Am I an idiot? 

I need advice. Yes, tell me that I’m the idiot I am for trusting them and having bad judgement and not doing my “wifely duties”. I own all those things. I just need help figuring out my next steps. I don’t want to be in a throuple and I don’t even want to look at either of them. It’s 3:30am and I can’t sleep and don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve been used. I don’t know even if I leave if I’d still have to pay for my husband’s expenses because he’s not working? Which would mean I’m paying for them to have a relationship, which idiot me has been doing since July and I really hate my life right now. 

TL:DR All work and no play makes THROWRA_justfml a fucked over wife and friend."

So, I'm a big pet lover. We have several dogs, reptiles, frogs and small animals. 

I work in the pet care industry and have recently lost my job due to the shutdown. 

That being the case, I've been home a lot more often, and I noticed the animals aren't attached the him like me. I thought nothing of it, as I care for them mainly and had most of them before we got together. 

Our pets have their own room, and yesterday I went to let out dogs out and our 5lb Chihuahua mix was limping and putting no weight on his leg. My husband jokingly said a few minutes before I checked on him, ""I got Rufus to stop scratching the door."" 

I thought nothing of it until my poor dog was unable to move. 

I took him to the vet and they did x-rays and let me know Rufus's hip was broken. They said being so small it could be because he jumped off the furniture and hurt himself, as he's rather old as well. 

My husband later admitted that he lost his temper, picked Rufus up the the scruff, and beat him. 

He feels incredibly guilty and wants nothing to do with any of the pets now. 

I found out yesterday I'm pregnant, and I'm worried he may loose his temper with a newborn much worse then Rufus's constant scratching. 

What do I do? I love this man and we've been married half a decade now."

A month ago, my friend called me in tears to tell me she found out her husband was having an affair. She confronted him and he swore he would end things and focus on their marriage.

Two days ago, her and Liam called my husband to ask him to confirm Liam was going to spend the evening with him, my husband said he was. I know he was lying because we had plans that evening so I confronted him about it. He got defensive and said he was only helping his friend out and it wasn’t a big deal because he only needed time alone and that Eleanor was too controlling. We got in an argument and eventually I asked him if he knew Liam had had an affair. He denied it but he’s a bad liar, so I knew he was BSing. I asked him how long he’s been covering for him, but he refused to answer any of my questions. When I told him I was going to let Eleanor know Liam wasn’t going to be with my husband he got really upset and told me I shouldn’t do that. We kept arguing over it and I eventually told him we should cancel our plans and he could really go hang out with Liam since helping him was so important to him.

I ended up moving into the guest room and haven’t really spoken to my husband much since. He keeps telling me he doesn’t understand why I’m so angry since it’s not like he was the one having the affair, but I really can’t look at him the same way.

How do I explain to him why I’m so upset with him? Am I overreacting?

TL;DR – my husband helped his friend cover up his affair, knowing I was friends with his wife. He now doesn’t see why I think it's a big deal."

Original:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i\_32\_f\_work\_overnights\_my\_fatherinlaw\_60s\_m\_keeps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fdzm9q/i_32_f_work_overnights_my_fatherinlaw_60s_m_keeps/)

I dealt with my family members at a family gathering over the weekend. I saw my sister (one of my family member who had been texting me) and reminded her that I am asleep at 3 or 4 pm when she texts. If she texts me first thing in the morning, like when she leaves for work at 7, maybe I can do whatever favor she needs before I go to sleep. I told her that I wouldn't be adjusting my schedule to do her favors. She seemed to understand.

Over the weekend, my husband and I sat down with my father-in-law one last time to try to get him to understand that I am a medical professional, I work nights, and that my nights are as hard as working a day shift, often times harder.

I brought up my MIL, and reminded him how she called 911 at 2 am when she had her first heart attack. I told him the person on the other end of that phone had a real job, the EMTs who came to take her to the hospital had real jobs, and the ER Nurses and Doctors that treated her had real jobs. I told him that yes, I could take a day shift, but **I** would be unhappy in the end because I'm just not wired to be awake during the day (today is an exception because I'm on vacation and had a dentist appointment.)

Well, those who guessed that this was way more about my job were right. After the discussion, he point blank told me that my chosen hours weren't conductive to having children. When I reminded him that when his son and I got married 10 years ago, we both agreed that we weren't having children, he had some choice words.

My husband kicked him out of our house, and my family will stop inviting him to family gatherings.

It's not the outcome I wanted, but hopefully he'll come around.

TL;DR: It was about children, not about my job. We are currently no contact.  


Edit: To be clear: He did not live with us, but near us. My husband kicked him out of our house that evening."

The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

EDIT 2: My friend went over to get the ring from her but she refused to give it to him and told me she would not give it to anyone and that I have to pick it up by myself. I dont know why she is still acting like this. I am thinking of just letting the ring go and be able to have a clear mind."
aap3jo,[Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas,25393,0.92,1116,2018-12-30 02:45:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aap3jo/update_from_the_loser_whose_girlfriends_rich/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aap3jo/update_from_the_loser_whose_girlfriends_rich/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded ""WE NEED TO TALK"" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like ""welp, I'm dead.""

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship."
fgdjw7,UPDATE My girlfriend's friends gave me a bath when I was drunk. I'm disgusted and embarrassed.,25401,0.75,3155,2020-03-10 18:39:07,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fgdjw7/update_my_girlfriends_friends_gave_me_a_bath_when/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fgdjw7/update_my_girlfriends_friends_gave_me_a_bath_when/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So about a week ago I posted my original which got deleted so I put it down there. And then there's an update for those who were wondering.

**ORIGINAL**

So I (20M) went out partying with a few buddies and we all came back wasted. I live with my girlfriend and I came home extremely drunk. My friends put me to bed and left. My girlfriend (19F) had two or three friends over.

I ended up throwing up on myself and my girlfriend came to check up on me and saw some puke on me. So she and her friends lugged me to the bathroom, took all my clothes off, and gave me a bath. Like a scrubbing everything with a sponge bath, butt naked. I was semi-conscious at the time and half-aware of what was happening but barely able to move. I mumbled “Stop” and “No” a few times but I don’t think they really heard. Even drunk me was humiliated to be naked in front of all my girlfriend’s face.

So they washed me then put me to bed with a blanket over me, without putting clothes on me. I woke up hungover the next day and could see I was naked under the covers. I immediately put clothes on and my girlfriend and her friends had slept over (they were doing a movie night thing) and they were already up. They all started giggling and I felt super self-conscious. One of them complimented me and said I was handsome.

I told them I was totally not okay with what they did. Their expressions immediately changed and they all started yelling they just helped me and I had no leg to stand on. I reiterated they were not allowed to wash me without my consent especially if I was able to talk and I was going to be talking to someone about it. They freaked out but I pushed past them and left. I haven’t gone back yet but I’ve been getting tons of texts begging me not to do anything. They keep saying when you’re drunk friends are supposed to help you out and clean you up. So now I’m asking: should I? Should I do something about this? What do I do? Am I wrong to feel exposed?

EDIT: To answer common questions:

1. I was not flailing or thrashing or continuing to puke, I was totally immobile. Everything was foggy and I told them no, but I wasn’t really moving.
2. I do not regularly get this drunk and thanks to all the people for saying it’s my fault. I’m in college, some days we go out and go a little overboard. We’ve all had those days where we threw up, it happens.
3. My girlfriend could have easily bathed me herself. There’s people arguing that switching the genders isn’t the same because one guy could bathe a drunk girl. So could she, I wasn’t fighting or anything. I’ve bathed her once or twice and I make her girlfriends leave too because I respect her privacy.
4. It is NOT the same as doctors doing it, doctors are trained medical professionals and my girlfriend's friends are not my loved ones, we’re not friends they’re her friends. We barely talk.
5. I have my own room, I puked in my room we don’t share it.
6. I am 5'11 and 138 lbs, for those wondering. My girlfriend is 5'7 and 124.

**UPDATE**

Hi again everyone, I'm the ""little crybaby bitch"" who's girlfriend and her friends gave me a group bath. Sound weird yet?  To clarify, I was fine with them helping me go to the tub, but my GF knew I was uncomfortable with her friends being there and trust me she did not need their help. I've cleaned her up before and she's cleaned me up once before and she did it on her own. These are HER friends, not mine, we don't have a relationship. They touched me all over while I was vulnerable and without clothes. That's disgusting and they 100% knew what they were doing wrong.

We've all gotten drunk before, we're in college, it happens. Not often, but every now and then and we help each other out. But my GIRLFRIEND had permission to help me out, not her friends. Just like how she gives ME permission to help her out, not her friends. They all stayed there. They knew they should have left. I told them to stop.

Anyway, the point isn't that, it's the update. I was staying at my friend's house and he was on my side, thankfully. My GF stopped by to talk when he was out and showed up at the door. When I saw her through the peephole the first thing I did was start a video on my phone in my pocket. She started explaining to me they were helping me out and I needed their help. I cut her off and asked her how she'd feel if my friends and I bathed her. She got quiet and said it wasn't the same thing, girls are more vulnerable than boys and it was her and her friends' natural ""maternal"" instinct to take care of me. I asked her real talk why didn't she tell her friends to leave? She didn't say anything for a while and then after some grilling she finally replied she did but they asked to stay because they ""didn't think she could handle it herself"". I asked why she didn't say no because she knew she could (she's done it once before), and she said they wanted to stay so she let them. They said ""just in case"" and insisted, so what's the harm. I asked why, and she shrugged. She started crying.

I asked her why they didn't leave me in my boxers. She said they were dirty. I said no, she could have easily poured water with the handheld showerhead and they would have cleaned. I puked on my shirt. I asked her again but she stayed firm on them being dirty and she definitely had to remove them. She sort of shut off then but I told her I wouldn't be able to forgive her if she didn't tell me exactly what happened and why. I hugged her and said I had to know or else we were done.  She was hesitant but I swore up and down I wouldn't take it to the police, I just wanted to know. She finally agreed and I asked if they heard me tell them to stop and she said she had heard me say something and shake my head but she didn't know what I said.

I went back to our place after the conversation and after she went to sleep I took out her phone. Yes, okay, I'm a snoop, I'm wrong, but I had to know. We know each other's passwords so I opened it and went to her texts. I texted them from her, asking if they knew what I had mumbled. One claimed not to have heard anything, the other two admitted they'd heard me mumble ""Stop"" but I was ""drunk and needed their help."" I screenshotted the texts (there were some texts directly after the event where one commented ""well, that was fun"". Maybe sarcastic, maybe not, nevertheless I don't like it).

I left afterward, back to my friend's place and texted my GF I wasn't quite ready to continue our relationship but we'd see how it went.

The reason I'm posting this is because I want some advice. I have evidence of what they did, screenshots of texts and a voice recording. The question I'm asking now is should I take it to the RA or the sexual assault department. I know now they chose to stay in there after my GF asked them to leave and my GF let them stay in there. I know they physically bathed me when I was immobile and didn't need more than one person. But is this reason enough to go to authorities? I haven't told our mutuals about the incident because that may lead to ostracization and I don't know where I want to go with this. I'm not ready to let it go, but should I report it? Our college has a firm policy on things like this, it's not a little thing. They investigate all claims, whatever they are, carefully.

Better ask judgment-free internet strangers than actual people in my life. Let me have it, guys."
gwdaw1,My (24F) husband (38M) keeps sexualising my childhood trauma even tho I’ve asked him not to. I’ve tried everything. Nothing is working. Thinking of divorce.,25315,0.9,3159,2020-06-04 13:51:16,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwdaw1/my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my_childhood/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwdaw1/my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my_childhood/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"NSFW

Please don’t waste your time on the age gap. It’s something I’ve dealt with for our whole relationship and I don’t want to get lectured about it.

I’ve been with my husband for 6 years, married for 2. I know he’s older but he looks very youthful for his age and he’s super fit and active so honestly the age was never an issue, ever.

Between the ages of 10 and 15 I was sexually abused by my step dad and when I first started getting serious with my now husband, I told
Him everything. All the details, all the ways it screwed me up and all the horrible after math and fall out from various family members. In short, it was all bad, in every which way you can imagine. 

Within the last 4 months, every time my husband and I make love, it starts out normal but at some point he always starts asking questions about the times I was abused. He gets real graphic and bc were in the moment, I always answer his questions. 

I’m not a prude by any means and I even have my own kinks which he always enjoys. But lately it seems his only kink is hearing me talk about the most traumatic time in my life. The questions he asks are so gross and so personal and he’s never asked these before. The concerning part is he seems to get excited about the details as I answer his question bc he always finishes super fast once he starts asking these questions.

I’ve sat him down SEVERAL TIMES and told him how it makes me feel less than, how it hurts me, how it makes me feel like trash. How it brings me back to a horrible time. And I’ve told him to stop. He always apologizes about it and says he won’t do it anymore. But then we start making love and whether it’s 10 minutes, 20 minutes or one of our longer sessions, he always ends up bringing it up near the end of our session a few minutes before he finishes. 

I write this in my bed alone as I’ve asked him to sleep on the couch tonight bc he just did it again after I repeatedly tell him not to.  

I don’t know what my next move is. I’m tempted to leave but I don’t work and would have to take him to court to get some type of support so I can live and I know that stuff takes time. I still love him and he’s a great husband in every other sense but this whole thing is turning me off and slowly but surely making me fall out of love with him. If he really loved me why would he continually hurt me like this? Also, is it possible he is perverted like, liking that stuff? How is this new I’ve known him for years and he’s never mentioned this as being a turn on. Any advice would be appreciated, I have no family and friends here as I’m new to the city we live in and my family lives in a different country. 

Thank you.

EDIT: I was not expecting to get so many messages. Literally thousands. Thank you to everyone who is sending support. It’s impossible to message all of you so I just want you to know I’ve read hundreds of your comments and the support made me cry. Thank you x a million. I will post an update soon. My husband is currently staying in a hotel so I have some time to think
About my options."

So an update to my previous post. 

She ignored my messages/calls for 3 days, at which point she text me asking if i was free for her to come over for a ""movie night"". i told her sure, but we need to talk about what happened before anything else. She replied with ""about what?"". 

i figured it was best to wait until i actually saw her in person before trying to discuss the issue, which i did. when she arrived, we sat down and i started by saying that i was upset by our last conversation and I'd like to discuss what happened, at which point she said ""it doesn't need to be discussed, can we leave it"". i said ""Not really no, I'd like to get to the bottom of what actually happened and also discuss your reaction of storming out and not talking to me for 3 days and then acting like nothing has happened."" 

she basically refused to discuss it, so i told her that if we can't at least discuss what happened then i want to break up and that she needed to get her stuff that she has in my apartment and leave. 

she lost her shit. bawling and screaming so much that my neighbour came and knocked on the door to check if everything was okay. He's a chill dude so asked if he could stay whilst she got her stuff together as she seemed to calm down once he was present. 

she basically sulked around slamming cupboards whilst she got her stuff and then left. 

so yeah, no real answers and im still confused as fuck as to what happened. i text her mom to keep an eye on her as im kinda thinking she's losing it. ive never seen her like this and it worries me. she's been blowing up my phone about how she loves me and cant imagine life without me but honestly this whole thing has soured me and I'm struggling to see any way that we will continue this relationship. 

thanks to everyone who replied before. 

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend baited me into a question about pubic hair, implied I was a pedo, ignored me for 3 days and then tried to act like nothing had happened and so I broke up with her. Fun."

We are pretty close and her family is on good terms with mine. We do have our fights like every other couple, I find my girlfriend to be pretty ‘reactive’ and it has been a problem before in our relationship but we can generally sort things out. 

Also, I want to add too, that I don’t live with my parents I normally have my own space but I moved in because of the lockdown and I didn’t want my parents out shopping. My parents are in decent shape, but we have a family history of diabetes my dad has Diabetes (Type 1) and my mom is prediabetic. 

My girlfriend has been understanding in fact she took this lockdown super seriously and was frustrated that people weren’t taking it seriously enough.

She started to go to the protests in our city, she asked me to go, I told her no that it would be irresponsible since I am with my parents. She was upset but understood. 

We were going to have a pizza night at my house, and my mom invited my girlfriend’s family not knowing that my girlfriend was out at the protests. Once I heard, I told my mom’s and told my girlfriend, that until she self quarantines for two weeks I don’t feel comfortable with her and her family at my house. 

My girlfriend was livid, and not only that her parents who are also hot heads just start getting angry. They start talking about how proud they are of their daughter for standing up to injustice, now I am punishing them by kicking them out of their house. That my mom didn’t care, that only I did, that I am driving a wedge between them. That I am trying to control their daughter’s beliefs. And her mom really just started yelling at me. Is this the type of son in law I am going to be? 

This thing has been ridiculous, my mom didn’t know when she invited them. I didn’t say they couldn’t ever come, but please wait you might be infected. My girlfriend’s family is acting as if because she wore a mask she is 100% immune. I don’t know normally when I have disagreements with my girlfriend, it is just me and her. But here it seems that both she and her mom mainly (dad is somewhat cool) are just hyping each other up. I think her dad is the most understanding but he is the quietest one in the family. 

I don’t know what to do here? I know for a fact I am not going to risk my parent’s wellbeing to appease my girlfriend and her family. But what can I do to get my girlfriend’s parents to understand? Like they should know better? Her mom is a Physician’s Assistant so how is she just turning a blind eye to this? Do I just try to let things cool off? 

**Tl;Dr- my mom invited my girlfriend to our house for pizza night not knowing that my girlfriend has been out at the protests. After I found out, I immediately canceled it. My girlfriend and her family have taken this as a huge personal offense.**"

I definitely didn’t expect my last post to blow up the way it did. Thank you so much to everyone who commented. I appreciated that I got advice from all over the spectrum, from people who completely agreed with me to people who completely agreed with my SIL, and people who thought both of us had a point. It helped me see that the problem is more complicated than I thought, which helped me understand that my SIL wasn’t just being a dick. It also helped me decide what things were and weren’t fair to be angry about. 

I also appreciated seeing a few people comment making fun of me for needing my dog with me, and the majority of people yelling at them and saying I was acting pretty reasonably for someone who endured a violent attack. I don’t want to be seen as someone delicate, and I’m glad that most people don’t see me that way. Reading everyone's comments, I had this moment where I was like, ""Yeah! They're right! I *did* almost get drug out of my house and murdered just a few weeks ago. Who the hell are these people to say how I should act???"" That felt really good and I really really appreciated it.

Anyway, the conclusion I came to in all of this is that while my SIL is well within her rights to protect her daughter, she went about it in a way that disrespected me, both as a friend and as a victim of a very recent violent attack. Both my parents and her parents live locally and babysit all the time; she and my brother could’ve easily dropped my niece off with them and came to visit. It probably would’ve been awhile before I even noticed my niece wasn’t coming around, at which point I would’ve been in a better place and more understanding that she was uncomfortable with her daughter around Thor. Regardless of what some people said about how my SIL and brother don’t owe me anything and all their allegiance goes to their daughter, I simply do not feel that way. We were extremely close before this happened; I was always there for them, and would literally drop plans to babysit my niece if my brother and SIL needed a night to themselves. The very least they could’ve done for me, after I was almost kidnapped and murdered, is try to find some compromise. We went from seeing each other 3 times a week to pretty much not seeing each other at all. Even if they weren’t okay with me crating the dog, they could’ve easily dropped their daughter off with Grandma and Grandpa for a few hours so I wouldn’t feel completely isolated. I also have a yard, so they could’ve come over with her and we all could’ve hung out outside, while Thor stayed inside. I’ve been upset about this for awhile, but wasn’t sure if I was right to be upset until so many people echoed that sentiment. So I appreciate it. 

I invited my brother and SIL over (I promised it would only be an hour or two and insisted they leave my niece with my parents), and tried to lay all this out without being confrontational or acting like a dick. To my surprise, my brother and SIL had no real understanding that I’ve been having a difficult time. They thought I was basically fine and everything in my life was more or less back to normal now that my stalker is in jail. I didn’t get into it in my previous post, but during the year that I was stalked, I worked really hard to not show many outward signs of fear. I even made jokes about having a stalker. I knew people wouldn’t want to hang out with someone who was constantly going on and on about some bad thing that was going on in their life, and I didn’t want to be “that person” who was perpetually in crisis. And more than that, I just didn’t want to always be thinking and talking about having a stalker. I wanted to not think about it as much as possible. So I guess I might’ve come off as unaffected by the whole thing.

I’m not sure if I totally buy that they didn’t know I was going through something traumatic and that it was taking a huge toll on my mental state. I mean, I got a gun and paid for tactical training. I bought a home security system. I got active in self defense classes and strength training, things that I previously had no interest in. Even if I wasn’t walking around telling everyone how scared I was, I think anyone would’ve been able to tell. Plus, who just brushes off having their house broken into in the middle of the night? It seems crazy and they don’t seem so emotionally unintelligent that they’d think that. But both my brother and SIL did apologize for being insensitive, and when I pressed my SIL on why crating the dog isn’t good enough, she eventually relented and said that it would be fine. It probably helped that the entire time they were over, Thor was asleep and loudly snoring in his crate.

The paranoid part of me is convinced they just don’t want to deal with me in a fragile state, made up an excuse about my dog, and are now just going to come up with some other excuse about why they can’t see me. I invited them over for dinner in a few days and they’re coming, so I guess I’ll just have to see from there. I can’t stress enough that these used to be my best friends, and I’m heartbroken to have not had their support. I’ve been trying to rely on my friends more now, and thankfully they've all been really supportive. I’m really lucky that this happened during the pandemic, because nobody is getting frustrated with me that I’ve basically refused to leave the house for a month—they’re all perfectly happy to pick up takeout and come over to watch TV for the 5th night in a row.

In other news, yesterday I left my dog at home and drove around my block alone. I was shaking the whole time but I did it! I keep trying to remind myself that I spent a whole year fighting back even though I was utterly terrified; I can’t just lay down and die now that I’m so close to getting my life back.

tl;dr Things are better with my SIL and brother but I don’t know if they’ll stay that way. I’m relying on friends for support instead. I’m disappointed but also doing better."

Original update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/e35vj6/i\_26m\_found\_out\_my\_fiance\_27f\_possibly\_gave\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/)

I deleted the original post, but put a recap in the original update.

It's been 10 days since I received the call that ended this relationship. I'm almost back to normal, although I can't quite shake a bit of malaise. Thankfully I had a few days worth of PTO to burn while I worked past this crap. I already scheduled my 2 weeks vacation this year for the wedding, but since it's canceled I'll just spend it with the family and have a very extended Christmas with them.

Outside of a few texts from Jane to my mother when things first blew up and her mother calling the next day after I talked to Janes stepfather, I haven't heard a peep from their clan since. Janes mom tried to act as a mediator between us, but I shut that shit down and told her it's not possible. She can be a bit pushy, but thankfully she realized it wasn't wise to push this time. I finally got to talk to the bridesmaid who's husband called me. She didn't offer any more details and I didn't care to ask for any more by the time I talked to her. She just called me when she felt comfortable enough to wish me well and tell me she was sorry for what happened. She's a very nice lady and I feel bad for her because she works with quite a few of those women, and I don't envy how they are going to treat her at work. I asked her and thankfully none of them have any managerial authority over her, but it still sucks to ostracized.

As far as any of the other women, I haven't heard a thing, and my cousin has done a vanishing act. My mom took care of cancelling all the wedding invitations as she was the one who helped send them all out. I asked her to just tell everyone that Jane and I had a change of heart about getting married and decided to put things off for the time being. Frankly I'm fucking embarrassed about what happened and don't really want to be known among family and friends and people in town as that guy who's ex-fiance jacked off and possibly screwed a stripper right before their wedding. I'm sure it will eventually get around, but if I let it fade like this it will be more of a crazy rumor than confirmed fact for most people.  I really just want to walk away with as little drama as possible and move on with  my life.

I've asked my mother to text Janes mom to get the engagement ring back. Hopefully she won't give me any trouble as they were expensive and buddy of mine is willing to buy the ring set for exactly what I paid for them for his wedding in a few months. I told him he'd better not tell his girlfriend where he got them just in case she's worried my ex was wearing the ring when she was handling stripper guys joystick. I lost thousands in deposits for the venue, DJ, florist, catering, security, plane tickets, honeymoon suite, etc etc etc... I'm hoping I can recoup a little money by selling the rings.

Anyway, I've decided to stay away from LTR's for an indefinite amount of time. This experience has made me very gun shy about ""love"" and relationships and all that mess. People have sent me all kinds of of encouraging messages claiming I'll eventually find ""the one"". I'm doing my best not to be overly pessimistic, but when looking at the divorce rates and all the crazy conflicts between men and women these days, I'm starting to think the chances for *anyone* to do that are getting lower with each passing year. And I'm not the kind of guy who gets over stuff like this by running out and dating some other woman to sport hump right afterwards.

So I think I'll just stay single for now, and focus on my passions and work. Anyway, thanks to everyone who gave encouragement. If anyone else goes through something heartbreaking like this, I highly recommend you you stay with family and or close friends you have a good relationship with. I can't overstate how much this helped, especially if you are a guy. Men don't really maintain a circle of support for stuff like this, like many women do, and you can find yourself isolated and descending further into a bad place without positive reinforcement around you. I was able to lay on my childhood bed, in my childhood room, in my childhood home surrounded by good memories, having my mom come in and bring me tea and food and say sweet encouraging things about how much she loved me and how proud she was of me. I was able to shit talk with my dad and brothers to distract myself. It helped a lot.

Best of luck everyone. Thanks."

Hello everyone, hope you guys are staying safe from coronavirus.

I met my girlfriend when I was in my senior year in college, she was a junior back then. We have been dating for 3 years now. I'm Asian and she's white. To say I don't deserve her would be an understatement. She's the most beautiful and the smartest girl I know and she comes from a pretty wealthy family. I'm not particularly handsome or attractive, not extremely smart (just because we both went to an Ivy League college doesn't mean shit, it just means I have slightly above average IQ but I decided to work harder than most other high schoolers), and our family is not very rich either. We aren't poor, my parents were able to help me pay for college and I only had to take a few thousand in student loans, but we are certainly not as wealthy as her family. I really love her and I try to be the best boyfriend I can be.

Unfortunately, her entire family is racist except for her and her brother (who is one of my best friends). Every time we go to one of her family gatherings, there are racist comments tossed around. It's against everyone who isn't white, including Asians but also African Americans, Mexicans, etc. I am the only one there who is not white. I don't know if they are trying to insult me intentionally with comments like ""Oh those yellow (n-word)s stealing our jobs"" but it not only annoys me on a personal level but also just like in general, they're being such racist assholes. But I try to be as nice as possible because I don't want to let this ruin our relationship. But her family members still all dislike me.

So yesterday her dad texted me. I knew that my girlfriend's parents know my number but it's still strange because her dad doesn't like me at all and we have never really had a 1 on 1 conversation. But anyway, he sent me a few texts saying ""This relationship has gone far enough"" and to sum things up he said that if I didn't break up with my girlfriend he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. And then he said if I really loved her I would know that her family was more important to her and stuff like that. I have no idea why he decided to say this now and not like 3 years ago when we first started dating.

I haven't talked with my girlfriend yet because I don't really know how to tell her about this. I know she loves her family and I don't want to hurt her relationship with them. But I also don't want to hurt her by just breaking up with her without telling her why.

I really need some advice here my fellow Redditors, how do I tell her about this situation? Even if we do end up breaking up, I want to do what makes her happy in the long run.

**TL;DR** My girlfriend's family is racist and they don't like me. Her dad told me that either I would break up with her or he would disown her and her entire family would cut her off. I don't know how to tell her about this.

**UPDATE**

So first of all I want to apologize for not updating until today. Yesterday I checked the first \~30 or so comments and they all said show her the text. I have a job as a tech lead and we had like 4 meetings in a row yesterday. Couldn't really zone out to check Reddit. And afterwards I was pretty tired so my lazy ass decided not to update until today. I never expected it to blow up so much. Today I woke up and I saw like >2k comments and 22.9k upvotes and I was pretty blown away so sorry for not responding to anything.

I texted my girlfriend yesterday and sent her a screenshot of what her dad sent me. She said she needed some time to think and I just told her I love her and I'd respect her decision either way. So I guess all that's left to do is wait.

So now I guess I will respond to the general categories of comments/questions:

>Show her the texts.

Done.

>You're taking away from her right to decide as a grown adult woman. You're being sexist/misogynist. You need more communication and trust in a relationship.

That was kind of eye opening for me. Her dad's texts were all completely directed at me, like YOU need to make this decision. It's YOUR fault. All of the YOUs kind of stuck me into the mindset where it really was my decision only. I don't know, I guess I was just being dumb as usual. Lesson learned though, thanks.

>Why didn't she stand up for you at her family gatherings? Why did she take you in the first place?

Well I've never really thought about this stuff before but as far as I can remember they only say that shit when she's not in the room. They have a pretty big house so she sometimes goes to talk with her other relatives in other rooms, and that's when it starts. I didn't think it would be good if I just followed her like a little puppy everywhere she went so I generally tend to stay in the same room.

Also my friend almost never shows up to those gatherings for some reason. Maybe it's connected to this, maybe it's not.

I've never really brought it up to her and straight up said that their racism pisses me off a little. I don't know, maybe I should have? I just didn't want her to think I'm a huge crybaby about it. It didn't really feel targeted towards me, because they were just being racist to every race in general, and I just happen to be included in one of them.

>Delete the text and don't tell her anything.

I don't think that's a good idea... maybe they're not lying.

>Reverse Crazy Rich Asians on them.

I have heard of that movie but have never watched it. Is it any good? Never been a big movie guy, I always just play PC games. The only time I watch movies is with my girlfriend.

>This post is fake.

Listen, man. I don't have that much spare time to make up a fictional narrative and publish it on Reddit. What do I gain from making up a post like this? Karma? Awards? This is a throwaway account, not my main Reddit account. If I really wanted to Karma-farm, don't you think I would want to do it on my main? And I'm not really a huge fan of fantasy internet points anyway... I mean I don't know what else you want me to say.

For people who say they've never heard ""Yellow N\*gger"" before, it's probably because you're not Asian. I bet you've never heard ""Pancake Face"" before either...

>Please update.

I didn't feel like this update warranted a new post but I will make a new post when my girlfriend makes up her mind if you guys want.

Thanks to all of you for your replies!"
g0pxlk,Update: My (38/F) ex-fiance ghosted me (39/M) before our wedding. It's been 16 years and now she wants to talk it over again. Should we reopen closed wounds?,24615,0.88,1065,2020-04-14 01:03:54,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g0pxlk/update_my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g0pxlk/update_my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz8bw7/my_38f_exfiance_ghosted_me_39m_before_our_wedding/)

Well, that was something. I got closure at least.

We met at a cafe and sat and talked outside. The first thing I noticed was how badly scarred her arms were and how much pain was in her face. Long story short  she  wanted to break up long before the wedding, she was too weak and cowardly to speak up for herself. She had a complete nervous breakdown over everything. She had been tired of being forced into doing things she never wanted to do and never having the guts to stand up for herself. She was mad at her family pressuring her to get married and pump out kids, she was mad at them forcing her into a degree that she didn't want, she was mad herself for not being able to speak up. Nothing she did was justified which we agreed on.

When I first proposed to her I did it in a public area. I had put her on the spot and she wanted to say no but, she couldn't bare to see me hurt. She was right. I made all the choices for her. I was a very different person back then and she was very ""meek"" as in she just went with the flow and had no backbone. I drowned her voice out often and often never gave her the chance to grow to be a person. Back then I was often focused only on myself. 

Well, everything came to a climax and she had a complete mental breakdown. She ran way from her problems at the beheast of her best Friend and only person in the world she ever trusted. As she said it's the only thing she knows how to do: run. She never had the spine to speak up. 

Her life just spiraled downwards. She did a few years homeless after her bestfriends husband kicked her to the curb. The rest of that time was spent in Prison, which she didn't specify what she did.  She was released about a year ago and has been turning her life around. She has a job, she's reconnected with her parents and she's finally reconnecting with me. She never stopped trying to get in touch with me. 

As for our future. We have none. We both agreed to end things and  go our separate ways. We both are changed, two different people.  We have nothing in common and don't live near each other. She doesn't justify what she did nor does she want to be forgiven. She thinks its repulsive and is ashamed of her actions. I wanted to be angry but, i couldn't. I just forgave her. With that we shook hands said our goodbyes and that will likely be the last time we ever see one another. 

It's bittersweet. I got the closure I wanted. We both did. It feels like a burden was released. I know now we never had a future together and  never will. But, on the other I'm sad because it's over. All these years maybe hoping something would happen were for naught. But, in the end this is an ending and I finally have closure. Not many get to say that.

Do I believe her story? Yes, I do and even if she's full of shit at this point does it even matter? I've always known her to be very weak willed, meek. She often just does what everyone tells her to do and often runs when things get too difficult. She avoids her problems because was too weak to stand up  to them.  I mean it makes sense why her family would not talk to me about her. They were the typical tiger parents that disowned their problem child.

---
tl;dr
Alls well that ends well.  Our relation has finally come to an end and we can move on."

I've been thinking a lot and I decided that I'm ending my relationship with her.

This isn't easy for me. It's hard because I've been with her for almost two years, but it's even harder because now I feel a ton of guilt myself as I remembered things that I ignored, and how I was only worried about her after I became the victim. I mentioned that point in the other thread, but I feel even worse about it now.

I know I was stubborn in the last thread but I listened to everyone's advice very carefully. You all helped so much. When people brought up the sadism aspect, it sort of clicked. I don't know if it was stupidity or selfishness, but I didn't think of her that way until this week. I just ignored everything she did. I thought about some memories using this new perspective.

I remember early this year her dad got her a job at the front desk at this apartment complex. It's hard to explain this place because it was sort of a luxury place and most apartments aren't like this, but I was there once or twice to pick her up and I remember what the building looked like. There were a lot of older people living there and right near the entrance of the building there was an elevator which only went up. Then there was the main elevator which was kind of far down a long hallway. She had to call that first elevator down after the person was approved to go into the building. One time me and her were smoking and just chilling talking about stuff. She was laughing to me about how she would sometimes disable the up elevator and pretend it was out of order, and then she'd watch these older/handicapped people walk down this long hallway to get to the main elevator.

She got fired pretty quickly anyway because she activated the fire alarm when there was no fire. When they asked her what happened she pretended that the computer was glitching and she couldn't stop it, but they believed she did it on purpose so they fired her. I'm sure some people could have been injured during the chaos. I guess the alarm must have disabled the elevators so everyone had to grab their stuff and run down the stairs as quickly as possible. I can imagine all these elderly people going down so many flights of stairs. I don't think anyone was injured but they did fire her and maybe they're still investigating. I don't know if it could help, but I'm gonna call that place and tell them what she told me and how she admitted to pulling the alarm on purpose. That will help my conscience out a lot.

Like I said, I feel terrible about ignoring this stuff. You might think I'm an idiot or a terrible person myself. I don't know what to say but when I really thought about this stuff, I decided I couldn't be with her. I know people will criticize me and that's fine. This is an update but also a confession tbh because I have to get that off my chest. And there's a bunch of other stories too that she told me or that I saw myself. I enjoyed her craziness tbh even though I was always on edge but I thought of it as her being fun and spontaneous instead of sadistic. I guess I'm pretty weird myself.

I responded to her texts this morning because she was starting to get angry and was sending a lot more texts. I told her I was really sick and thought she shouldn't be near me, but that we might be able to hang out again in a week or two. I said I wasn't mad at her anymore and I just didn't respond because I was sick. I just told her that to get her off my back and to give myself time to prepare for the break up because I don't know how she's gonna react and I want to be safe. For example she has keys to my house and I'm living with other people including kids so I want to change the locks and make sure we're not tied together in any other ways before I do an official breakup. Do you think that's a smart idea? I could use any advice on the best way to do a breakup in this situation because I'm kind of worried. Once again, thanks so much for all your advice last time and have a good day."

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time. 

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

TL;DR: My friends are acting like I was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face."

I'll try to get all the details without going on for too long. So basically I (30M) got raped at a party about 8 months ago. I got drunk and an acquaintance of mine took advantage of me. I hardly remember it but I woke up the next morning naked with a vivid memory of what had happened. I remember putting up a fight, but not much else. I also have a very very vague memory of her holding a phone the entire time, but that's about it (will be important later). I immediately went home and told my wife.

She was extremely sympathetic and let me cry on her shoulder. I was a sobbing mess. At the time I did not want to press charges because I didn't know how it would go if I, a male) accused a woman of raping me. 

Anyway, I ended up telling my friends because they questioned why I stopped showing up to gatherings. The girls response was basically that it was consensual and I was lying to keep my wife from getting mad at me. Half of my friends believe her and the other half are on my side. It was a mess. In the end, I decided to just distance myself from them all. 

One of my supportive friends contacted me letting me know that she had gotten pregnant, but ended up aborting. This was a whirlwind of emotions for me but in the end I decided that it was for the best. My wife took this in a different way. 

She says that she wasn't aware that my abuser made me finish and that I wouldn't have cum if I genuinely wasn't enjoying it. We argued for days and she kept telling me I was sick for faking a rape allegation just so I could cheat on her. We've separated but are not yet divorced. I've been staying with my brother. 

Well, at this point, I decided that I needed to go to the police to clear my name. I hired a lawyer and when he heard my recount of the events that I remember, he was absolutely convinced that she had recorded the encounter. I don't know why, all I mentioned was that she was holding a phone, but I guess it makes sense. 

Anyway, her phone and laptop were searched but there was nothing. It took months, but finally we were able to retrieve the video via the cloud. I guess you can't really ever fully delete something. The video clearly depicted me in a vulnerable state and incoherently trying to get her off of me. It was sick. 

Anyway, with this evidence plus witness accounts courts sentenced her to 2.5 years in prison. When this happened, I guess my wife realized that I actually had gotten raped and has been pleading to get back into my life. She says she made a mistake and just assumed and she's so sorry, but I don't know if I can ever forgive her.

Should I continue with divorce or try to work things out with her?"
a2qwqk,Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met,24244,0.89,996,2018-12-03 23:09:27,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a2qwqk/update_my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a2qwqk/update_my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""Maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""Joe"" and his wife ""Kate."" After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist."
igl2hr,My stepsister is telling my whole family my boyfriend got her pregnant to make herself feel better.,24003,0.96,1486,2020-08-26 02:34:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/igl2hr/my_stepsister_is_telling_my_whole_family_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/igl2hr/my_stepsister_is_telling_my_whole_family_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Sorry weird title. So I met my 25F boyfriend “Tim” 26M 3.5 years ago. We hit it off he was great and sweet and we get along perfectly. Until I introduced him to my family. My mother had gotten remarried a few months earlier, I like my stepdad and we get along fine, my stepsister “Sarah”  who is 26F and were friendly but not besties by any means. She is kind of an intense party girl and being in our 20s we only saw each other at family events. 

So I introduced Tim to my family at which point we learn that Sarah used to date Tim when they were 20. It was only a few months and Tim said they broke up because she made out with another guy at a nightclub while drunk. Sarah got upset and started saying I had to break up with him because it was weird. She called Tim her “sloppy seconds” and tried to get our parents to force us to break up. I said no. It had been years since they’d been together and I didn’t even know Sarah when she was dating Tim. 

I got pretty upset because my family jumped on the bandwagon of saying we should break up. For the past few years at any family gathering Sarah would mention how they used to date and act like I stole her boyfriend and has been selling that narrative to my family and friends. It became obvious that she was jealous. But I liked Tim so we just ignored it and kept dating. 

So now a few year later Tim and I live together and we’ve been talking about marriage and stuff and I recently had a conversation with my mom about how I thought Tim was going to propose because he’s not exactly subtle and we’ve talked about this for a while. At which point Sarah who just moved back in with out parents walked in. She started asking a bunch of invasive questions about our relationship and being weird. 

Sarah is four months pregnant, the father she said was some deadbeat guy she’d hooked up with who wants nothing to do with her, but she wants to keep the baby. I’d been making an effort taking her to appointments and offering to help babysit and trying to be excited for her. Until a week ago when my stepdad sent me a long text saying how I can’t marry Tim because he is the real father of Sarahs baby. I was immediately very upset and confronted Tim who was completely shocked and said Sarah was lying. He said there’s no way and he didn’t cheat on me and he would gladly have a paternity test to prove that. Unsure I asked Sarah for more details about when they slept together which she says happened a few times. She was shaky and went back and forth on details. The dates and times don’t match up with what I can remember of what Tim and I have been doing. 

She also said she came to our house to see him but since Covid I’ve been working from home. So I cant imagine that they managed that. I’m pretty sure now that she’s lying to get us to break up because she’s still jealous. But now my family are involved and have been sending me hateful messages saying I need to break up with Tim and let him be with Sarah. She’s telling everyone he’s in love with her and I’m keeping him from her. She has no proof and he strictly denied everything. 

I texted her asking for proof of any of this happening and she sent me some fake photoshopped screenshots- that I can tell are fake. Where she’s put Tims name over a friends number and pretended he was messaging her. I checked and the friend all but admitted it to me and tried to laugh it off. She badly photoshopped the timestamps.

I actually don’t know what to do now. I believe Tim and we are still together but this has kind of thrown a wedge in everything. Sarah has poisoned my relationship with our parents and my family. I feel sick to my stomach and Sarah is now saying she won’t give me a paternity test. 

For now I’ve cut everyone off except Tim but I don’t know what to do now.

I wanted to update you on what happened.
Edit :apparently I have to make this clear. This is just an update post I have taken my decision. My parents will not meet my daughter until she is older and wants to. 


After some thought I decided to first meet my parents alone. I wanted to make a decision based on their remorse and development as human beings.

And they sadly didn't really change. When I agreed to meet I also told them it would be without my kid. Idk why but they thought they were going to meet her. They had bought presents and all. They were very disappointed to say it lightly when I showed up without her. They made no deal to hide it. But we talked. They fail to take any real responsibility for their actions. Every ""apology"" began with ""we are sorry if you"". When confronted about the CPS calls they say they were doing what was best for daughter. I got really mad but tried not to snap. They brought up every mistake I did as a young mother and that they just thought I was far too young and irresponsible to have a kid. That daughter only turned up good because of luck.

After they said that I laid down money for my meal stood up and said. ""well nothing has changed. You are still the heartless persons that threw me out years ago and made my life hell for 5 years. You will never meet her. She is happy and she has loving grandparents""

They started to freak out saying that I couldn't withhold their grandchild from them. I just said that you lay in the bed you make.

I left and haven't talked to them since. Mails or letters from them are thrown out on the spot. I will eventually explain to my daughter what happened to me and my parents and will give her the chance to meet them when she is older but for now I don't want to deal with their bs.





Edit :Guys thank for your concerns but I am non US. Grand-parent rights are not a thing where I come from

Edit2: I think some of you are confused. I am not asking about advice of wethee or not I should give in to my parents request. That's what my last post was about. It's not unwillingness to reflect it's a set decision.

Also yes my daughter is in therapy due to her being traumatised by all that lovely cps visit that we're caused by my parents. So I Infact k ow my child is happy and healthy mentally as well as physically"

---------------Actual Update---------------

After the post I decided it would be best to end things through a phone call. I mentioned ghosting, but it's probably best he knows how and why he fucked up. I waited until Saturday to reach out to him, told him ""we need to talk."" I'm paraphrasing here, but this is basically what the convo went like:

Dan: This is about the dinner, isn't it?

Me: Yeah it is. 

Dan: and?

Me: I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a group before. It felt like a shitty interview, all they did was test my knowledge. No one tried to get to know 
me, and when actual conversation was going on I was ignored or interrupted if I tried to talk. 

Dan: I don't feel it like it was anything like that.

Me: Ok, so how often do you guys sit around just asking questions like ""quick - what is the sql query if you want to delete two rows from two different tables!?!"" 

Dan: I don't know

Me: No really, do you quiz your friends randomly like that at work or out and about? 

Dan: No not really

Me: And why not? why don't you just ask lightning round quizzes like that? B/c it's not what normal people do?

Dan: I don't know. They were just having fun and joking around.

Me: It wasn't fun for me. I have male and female friends in all sorts of professions, I've never cornered any of them to test their knowledge. I trust they know 
what they're doing. I ask them about work, what they're doing, you know normal questions. 

Dan: ok

Me: I'm not going to print out a CPA exam and quiz my accountant friend, don't you think that would be a little fucked up? 

Dan: I don't know, maybe? 



We talked a little more about that night, and I gave him more specific examples of what he and his friends did and he never really had any good answered. It was a lot of ""i don't know"" and single word answers. I told him I created a reddit post and I would send it to him. He was a little pissed off that I did that, felt like I had no right to so. At the end of the conversation he asked if we were done. I told him yeah, that I can't see a future with him, that I saw a different side of him that night and I don't want to be someone's prize poodle on display for the world to see. He didn't really say anything after that and just hung up the phone. I sent him the url for my first post. 



He texted me throughout the weekend, but I didn't respond. He read the post that I sent him and wasn't happy with it, and said he couldn't believe so many people were on my side and were hating on him. He sent a few more angry texts after that like he couldn't believe we were breaking up over something so stupid. He did send a few rounds of ""I'm sorrys"" and ""let's try to work through this"" but when I didn't respond he just went back to angry texting me. 



Also, I did find his friend who buried his head in his phone that night and sent him the reddit link and asked if that sounded like what happened. Dan's friend said he knew what his friends were doing were wrong, and felt bad for me. He apologized for not stepping in, and assumed that Dan would eventually speak up for me on my behalf. He also apologized for joining them in the beginning, and wished me luck in my career. 



tl:dr: I tried explaining how that night was weird, uncomfortable and fucked up. He didn't see my point of view, didn't learn any lessons from it. I broke it off, he has been sending me angry texts, I haven't responded.

hwmll2,UPDATE: Boyfriend(29M) admitted that I am the oldest girlfriend(21F) he's ever had and now I want to break up with him,23889,0.9,1511,2020-07-24 01:15:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hwmll2/update_boyfriend29m_admitted_that_i_am_the_oldest/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hwmll2/update_boyfriend29m_admitted_that_i_am_the_oldest/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I could not post an update on the original post because it got removed after reaching a cap.

It has been a difficult time to be honest, my world has been turned upside down and I have been reeling from everything that happened. I cannot link to the previous post, but basically my 29 year old boyfriend nonchalantly admitted to dating a 15 y.o(when he was 27) and a 17 y.o(when he was 28) before he got with me.

I had been staying over at his place for the week and when I woke up from what i could only describe as a depression nap he was already in his home office working. I took the opportunity to pack my things and brace myself for what I was about to do. A part of me was still very much in denial of him being a predator and so I opted to fix breakfast so that I could get him to talk about it more and find out the true extent of these relationships.

I brought up his ex whilst we were eating, and he was more than inclined to talk about her. She went to the same high school as his sister (20F), and  that is how he met her. My now ex boyfriend makes a 6-figure salary and he drives a really flashy car, which he says was the reason she approached him, ""to check it out"". He continued to insist that she threw herself at him, and used him for his money when they finally got together. I asked him about the girls parents, and he said he met them and that they clearly didn't like him, but ""as long as their daughter was happy, they were alright with it"" that particular line did me in, but he harped on about how the dad never let him near his other kids and how much convincing it took for her parents to finally be alright with her sleeping over at his place.

He says that they broke up because she found someone wealthier and she dumped him. He apparently met the The second girl(17F) he dated online. I asked for specifics and he said she lied about her age on Tinder because she was turning 18 soon anyways (she apparently specified this in her bio) and they just ""clicked"" but he was only looking for a rebound - so they didn't ""really date"" they just ""fucked"" (his exact words). That apparently lasted a month until she dumped him as well.

When I asked him if he prefers girls in that age range he said ""for sex yes, but obviously I want a more mature woman to grow old with"" and he looked at me as if that statement was supposed to somehow reassure me, or make me feel better. I couldn't act passive anymore after that and I told him I do not think I am the woman he is going to grow old with. An argument ensued and he told me i was a ""horrible fuck anyways"" and ""How dare you accuse me of such a horrible thing, you're sick"" when I told him his proclivity for young girls was not normal and it might do him some good to get help for it. I grabbed my bags and drove back to my apartment.

Hindsight truly is 20/20 because so many red flags are glaring me in the face. I am petit (5'4, 120lbs) and he always liked how small I was, he constantly commented on it (I am not saying this is wrong, people have preferences but looking at the entire series of events, this is a bit eerie). There were a few times where he told me I remind him of his ex and even though it made me feel uneasy, i just dismissed it as him having a 'type', I also didn't know at the time that she was a teenager. He has been insistent on me moving in with him and quitting my job because he makes enough money for both of us to live comfortably and he made it sound so romantic - I was genuinely considering it (I think he might have been trying to isolate me, he already didnt like most of my friends). He was also very emotionally manipulative, all the times he has ever guilt tripped me or used the things I told him in confidence against me, all came rushing into my mind. I am starting to see how far from perfect our relationship was, and I am sick to my stomach thinking about it all.

We are in Washington and I do not know how I can possibly stop him from doing this to someone else because I have no evidence and I am afraid my claims will be dismissed if i report him. I am also concerned about how this will affect the victims in this case, is it really alright for me to report something on their behalf? I would like some advice on this, the guilt will eat me up if I do nothing.

tl;dr - I dumped my boyfriend because he didn't see anything wrong with him dating teenagers, but now I do not know how to stop him from victimizing even more young girls."
hhhq2f,I’m a Korean female (24) in an interracial relationship with a white male (29) and struggling with identity issues,23851,0.79,2865,2020-06-28 22:19:03,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hhhq2f/im_a_korean_female_24_in_an_interracial/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hhhq2f/im_a_korean_female_24_in_an_interracial/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I’ve met my soulmate. He’s amazing, I’m crazy in love.. But the closer we get to marriage and children, the more resentful I become. I’m  sad and resentful, at no one and everyone, and I’m struggling with how to come to terms with it.

He’s white, I’m Korean. We’ve talked about race on multiple occasions. He’s even brought it up by asking what it was like to live in the US as an Asian female. He listened to my experience and asked a lot of questions. He’s the first non-minority I’ve ever dated who has made me feel heard and understood. He also has a million other wonderful traits, I love him very much and I’m so excited to have found the person I want to share my life with.

However, the more serious we get, the more frequently I experience episodes of anxiety about identity. I’m a Korean female adopted into a white family. My parents are white, my siblings are white, my extended family is white, my adorable little nieces and nephews are white, and I am almost always the only Asian person in whatever room I am in. I struggled with identity issues as a child (I learned how to use makeup to make me look ‘more white’, I stuffed my bra, hated my hips, begged my mom to let me dye my hair and buy contacts, etc…). With age and a lot of therapy I finally feel comfortable with who I am... and now I’m in a relationship with a 6ft tall ginger. He’s beautiful and I love him, but he looks nothing like me… and I fear that neither will our children. Maybe I’m wrong, but after using Google Images, I’m imaging slightly ‘exotic’ looking white children. I’m sure they’ll be absolutely adorable and I’ll love them to pieces, but they won’t look Asian.

When I thought about my life, I always imagined having children and I always imagined them being Asian. The idea of finally living in a home where there are people who look like me has brought me comfort for so long… and now I’m realizing that it may never become a reality. My partner and I do plan to adopt. We want to experience pregnancy by having one biological child and then adopt the rest. Adoption is very important to me, but we’re interested in adopting children who would otherwise grow up without a family- which means foster children and not the private adoption of Asian infants. The likelihood of us coming upon an Asian foster child who is available for adoption is quite small.

I’ve spent my whole life being ‘the other’ and now even the child who grows in my womb won’t look like me. It feels like a death in the family. It feels like I’m grieving this life that will never be and it’s bringing up a lot of pain I thought I had moved past. I don’t know how to feel.  I am incredibly sad about the idea of not having an Asian child, but at the same time I feel like his/her life would be better if he/she didn’t have to grow up as ‘the other’ in a predominantly white country.

I love my family, I have no regrets about being adopted. They’re incredible and have surrounded me with so much love and support. I love my boyfriend, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him… but I have so much anger and hurt inside of me that I’m always the friggin Asian girl. I hate being the only Asian in the room. I hate being the only Asian in my family. I hate it. I hate that I stand out in whatever group I’m in, and now I’m realizing that there will probably be a family portrait hanging above our fireplace of my white husband, our white children, and me.

I just reread this before posting, and it has a lot of anger. I just want to be clear that I have moments of anger and pain, but most of the time I’m happy and excited to start my life with him… it’s just rubbing old wounds that feel really raw. I feel stupid and petty putting it in writing, but the pain is real and I want to be able to move past it. Has anyone been in a similar experience? I would love any insight.

TLDR; Asian girl in a serious relationship with a white male and grieving that her children probably won’t look like her.

Edit: This got a lot bigger than I anticipated. I have noticed a lot of comments expressing concern that I would resent a white child or that I only want children to produce a lookalike, and I can understand those concerns- but it's not how I feel at all. I do want to add that  Relationship\_Advice is filled with posts from people who are expressing their deepest and darkest/most private fears. This is a deep, dark, and shameful fear of mine. Everyone has thoughts they are ashamed of and want to resolve. I would never get pregnant just to produce a lookalike, and I will love any child I have (biological/adopted/white/asain/blue/purple/green) with all of my heart. That doesn't change the fact that it can be really difficult to be the only person in 99% of the rooms you're in who looks like you. It's very common struggle among transracial adoptees and minorities in general. This isn't something I struggle with 24/7, it isn't one of my defining character traits, but it is a private pain I have. I was hoping to find other people who have experienced the same thing, and talking to them has been incredibly helpful. Thank you so much :) I really appreciate all of the insight and advice I've received. I'm going to get back into counseling to address these new and confusing Identity issues that have starting popping up."
duk7rb,I (26f) am an escort and I am falling in love with one of my clients (39M),23828,0.87,2523,2019-11-11 06:02:11,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/duk7rb/i_26f_am_an_escort_and_i_am_falling_in_love_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/duk7rb/i_26f_am_an_escort_and_i_am_falling_in_love_with/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"If you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me I am being exploited please don't I am not here for that.

&#x200B;

I took on this client about a year ago. I was immediately struck with how handsome he was. As I got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. He is always gentle I never had to enforce any boundaries with him. Over the last year I have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. If there's a scheduling conflict I will give him the priority, lately I have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things I dont do with my other clients. I love my overnights with him. We have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. I feel very safe with him.

&#x200B;

I am falling in love with him. Its never happened to me before. I have always kept emotion separate from my work but I cant help it with him. I will spend time with him I dont bill him for, I spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. I've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates I guess for lack of better word that I'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  I dont know what to do. I think I want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but I cant imagine he would be ok with my work if I was his gf. I am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, I think I would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200B;

I dont know what to do. Do I go for it? Risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? Do I give up my career for him if he says yes? I dont think I could continue this if I was with him personally. Do I just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? Or do I drop him as a client altogether? I was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but I cant help what I'm feeling for him.

&#x200B;

\*Edit\*I know why hes single. His wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

Edit2 I cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. I am going for it. I'll tell him this week. Now to figure out how. Lots had asked if I have a back up I do.

Edit 3 I'm about to leave for lunch with him. I'm not going to bring it up yet but I do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. Thanks for all the support. I didn't expect to see this much support.

Edit 4 Lunch was nice. We had a good time. I did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. Then he asked me if I ever saw myself getting married and I had a similar answer, I told him I asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. He said he's like that. I'm going for it.

Final Update 

Well I truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. I didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. I really didn't expect all the support I got. I was flooded with Comments, Pms and chat requests. Some were about what I expected. Accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response I expected. What I didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. You were all right in that I did know what I really wanted. I did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push I needed to not waste anymore time. Shoot your shot right?

&#x200B;

I'd like to address a few things before I get into the update

&#x200B;

A few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. I was pretty sure he wasn't married I did out-calls to his home and my married clients NEVER take me to their home always a hotel. But I was regularly in his home, I saw the pictures of her around the house I know she was real. 

&#x200B;

How can I trust a guy who uses escorts? Well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what I do. I cant imagine judging a man for using my service. I was his first too and unless hes a good actor I know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. I never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200B;

I should wait for him to approach me. Unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. As the lines became blurred I did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous I had to drop. I am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. I had to be the one to make this move

&#x200B;

Do I want to do this forever/Do I really want to give it up? Different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. Some in favor some against. Bottom line is I don't think I see myself doing this into my 30's. It used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets I look forward to anymore are the ones with him. I also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. I heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but I just cant. Even if he would be ok with it I just cant. Another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what I do. Shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200B;

A lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. I imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so I'll put it here. We have been. For some time now. We meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. We also text throughout the week. 

&#x200B;

Ok on to the Update. I think I left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. This was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. I posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. He said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. Then he followed up with a question about if I would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. And I sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. He had to go back to work by this point and I invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. He has never been to my home. I dont bring clients back there only friends. I hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200B;

I went back home and started getting ready, I had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. I called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as Reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" I told her about the reddit post and said I was making the jump. I also let her know I wanted to take her up on her offer. I called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. I said something had come up and I wouldn't be available. I'm out. I'm done regardless of what happened with him If I cant get my head in the game anymore and I'm getting too personal, plus now I am realizing I want to be in a relationship and I cant separate sex from my feelings like I thought, its time to call it. This isn't what I want anymore. This choice was for me not him. Even if things didn't work out with him I realized I really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. One thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when I told him. I honestly didn't believe he would but I asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. She knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200B;

I got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. He came by at around 7. He had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. I invited him. He said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. I told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. I dont bring clients to my home. I was really hoping he was getting the hint. Dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but I could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. So I put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""Shoot my shot"" as you all put it. I told him I was dropping him as a client. He looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? What did he do wrong? Did something happen. I assured him it want about him. I was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. I told him about the job I took and he wished me good luck, he said I was attractive and charming and he was sure I would do well in sales. He said he was going to miss me. I took a big deep breath and said. ""You dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" And then I spilled it. He was the only client I brought home to tell in person. I laid it all out all the things I mentioned in the post. How I felt about him and how I didnt want to be his escort anymore. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I said I understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now I was asking to stick around and I would understand if he didnt want to continue on. He said who told you that? That he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. He said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. He was still hurt over his wife And that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. He asked me if I was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. I told him I could work with it and that I wasn't trying to replace her. We kissed. I led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200B;

We spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. He offered to help me make the transition but I told him I wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. I appreciated his offer and if I needed the help I would ask but I need to do try on my own at first. He respected that. I told him that things would change now. As his GF I would have expectations of him I never had as an escort. He was ok with that. I told him I never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now I wanted monogamy I would give it and I wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and I reminded him I dropped my clients. He said that wasn't a problem. I was the only one. He spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200B;

Where is this going to lead us next? I have no idea. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was God working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. Fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. I'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. My whole life has drastically changed in just a day. I didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200B;

To everyone who said I was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but I have to find out, To everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it I would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200B;

As a final thought I want to say that this isn't normal. If you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. While I'm sure it happens and Ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. If you're considering Sex Work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. Oh and I hated Pretty Woman btw. I never thought it would be me one day.

h7w3b7,I (44M) want to read my daughter’s (17F) diary to find out why she left us. My wife (43F) says we should absolutely not,23820,0.97,1326,2020-06-13 05:19:00,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7w3b7/i_44m_want_to_read_my_daughters_17f_diary_to_find/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h7w3b7/i_44m_want_to_read_my_daughters_17f_diary_to_find/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"EDIT: After another restless night, I was very surprised to wake up to this. Thank you so much for your condolences and for sharing your thoughts and experiences. I wish I could respond to all of you but I am mentally exhausted. Again, thank you all so much.

My (44M) daughter (17F) committed suicide two months ago. It was honestly a big shock as she’s never shown any signs that she wanted to take her life. My wife and I blame ourselves and wishes that we could’ve done more. She was in therapy for something unrelated, she was very afraid and would panic at the sight of blood, so we thought that her feelings in general would be addressed during her sessions. We were always very supportive of her, asking her about her days or if she’s having any troubles about anything when she’s noticeably looking down. 

We only started cleaning out her room a week ago. I was going through her closet and tucked at the very back was a small backpack with her diary in it. I really wanted to read it because my daughter didn’t leave anything behind, not a note saying why she did it or anything, so I was hoping that maybe something in her diary would shine light as to why she did what she did. I brought the idea up to my wife and she said absolutely not, though she’s not with us anymore, she still deserves the utmost respect. My son (14M) also wants to know why her sister left but doesn’t think that reading her diary is the way to go about it.

I don’t know, I feel like we need closure. My family and her friends need closure. My wife cries herself to sleep every night, repeating that she wishes we could’ve done something different, and I comfort her. My son obviously misses his sister as they were so close. He misses her so much that sometimes we’d find him asleep by the door of his sister’s room in the middle of the night. My daughter didn’t have any social media presence but had a good amount of friends and none of them know why she did it either. This diary is our last shot of giving everyone she knew the answer why. I know diaries are very intimate and the last thing I want to do is disrespect my daughter.

If I don’t end up reading her diary, how will I find closure? How will my family move past this? Everyday is filled with tears and many thoughts of “why?” Was it my wife and I’s fault? We don’t know, which is why I want to know. If it was us, I don’t want to have us make the same mistakes with our only child left. I don’t know exactly what I’m asking for but anything would be appreciated."
gmatau,My (25F) grandparents walked in on me getting spanked by my boyfriend (28M),23768,0.93,891,2020-05-19 03:06:00,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gmatau/my_25f_grandparents_walked_in_on_me_getting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gmatau/my_25f_grandparents_walked_in_on_me_getting/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I was raised by my grandparents, and gave them a key to my place for emergencies. Well, my grandma gets really worried if you don't reply to her texts in an hour. 

This specific day was the first day I saw my boyfriend in weeks, because he had to go abroad for work and we wanted a bit of alone time. We put our phones on silent so we wouldn't be disturbed. Apparently my grandma wanted me to pick something up for her, and got worried when I didn't pick up the phone or respond to her messages for a few hours. 

She decided to come over to my apartment with my grandpa since she was worried, and used the emergency key. When they walked in I was splayed over my boyfriend's lap and we were both buck naked. 

Since we are the only people that live in the apartment, we do whatever we want wherever we want. This time, on the couch. Which meant that my boyfriend's hand hovering over my bare ass was the first thing my grandparents saw when they walked in.

I've never seen two people back out of an apartment so quickly in my life. My grandma still giggles nervously when she talks to me and my grandpa won't make eye contact with me when we FaceTime. 

How do I make this less awkward? A talk about my sexual preferences is not one that I want to have with the people that raised me."
hlk24c,My wife (36F) won't stop forcing me to drink her coffee... I don't want to hurt her feelings but I can't go on like this.,23724,0.89,2980,2020-07-05 15:18:31,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlk24c/my_wife_36f_wont_stop_forcing_me_to_drink_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlk24c/my_wife_36f_wont_stop_forcing_me_to_drink_her/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"My wife (36F) lost her job recently, while I (48M) am currently working from my home office. Because I don't often get a chance to take breaks, she is kind enough to bring me a coffee once in a while. Nothing fancy, just regular filter coffee.

This used to only happen once every few hours, so in an average day I'd drink maybe... 2-3 cups of coffee. That was fine.

The problem has come in recent weeks. When I sit down at my desk (usually 8.00-8.30) there is a steaming cup of coffee waiting for me. Great. I drink it. But almost as soon as I've finished, my wife will come in and leave me with a fresh cup of coffee.

Every 15-20 minutes, she will come into the room and bring me more coffee. I like coffee enough in the mornings, but I do not need to chug gallons of it throughout the day. The mugs that she brings me are not small either.

There are some issues I don't know how to explain or address. If I let the coffee go cold, she will make upset faces and often refuse to speak to me (sometimes for hours/even a full day) until I ask her for more coffee. I will admit that sometimes I deliberately don't drink my morning coffee on purpose just so I can get a few hours of peace.

We've talked about this repeatedly and almost daily at this point. Every time she comes in with a coffee, I'll tell her that I've had enough and I don't want any more. She will often just silently put the coffee down next to me and the process will repeat again.

I've asked for other drinks (water, coke sometimes) and she will sometimes bring these instead, but as soon as I've finished she will bring me another coffee.

Now I'm getting regular headaches, nausea, and sometimes I'll be able to feel my own heartbeat. I don't think for a second that all this coffee is good for me. 

TL;DR: my wife brings me coffee constantly and expects me to drink it, how do I approach this?"
csi2q5,Girlfriend’s little brother used my collection of ‘64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs,23704,0.94,4618,2019-08-19 20:18:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csi2q5/girlfriends_little_brother_used_my_collection_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csi2q5/girlfriends_little_brother_used_my_collection_of/,self.relationship_advice,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20’s and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don’t know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that’s what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her “he only got $100 of weed so that’s fair”. Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack “useless and paranoid and stupid”. I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I’m looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they’re worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?"

Update:

I wanna thank you all for taking your time and reaching out and giving advice. 

The last few days, I feel like a burden was lifted off me, especially from my parents who always expect many things from me. The first day after the confrontation was a shit show. My parents forced relatives to reach out to me asking me to see reason (lmao), I declined. They stopped after 2 days after a harsh message from me requesting no contact.

I also took appointments for family planning (vasectomy) which is next month. Some people asked if I would ever tell my family about this, but I will not. My body, my business. I will of course tell potential future dates that I am childfree and also had a vasectomy beforehand.

Some people asked where I am from. I am from India."

He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like ""Haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""C'mon, please? I want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say ""Well, that could've gone a lot worse."" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like ""Wtf"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?"

Yesterday my husband fell asleep on the couch with his phone on his chest. As he turned over the phone dropped. I went to pick it up to make sure he hadn’t accidentally cracked the screen and the phone lit up with a text from his friend Amber which read “look at your other phone ;)”, there was also a second text which said “goodnight xxx”. I put the phone back down on the ground because I didn’t want him to know I had seen it.

When he woke up, he was looking frantically for his phone and when I told him it fell, he looked relieved as soon as he picked it up. He started smiling when he replied to his messages. When we went to bed, I sat up all night waiting to see if he would take out this mysterious second phone, but he just went to sleep straight away and never woke up again in the night.

Is there a reasonable explanation for this? Did she accidentally text the wrong person? Do I confront my husband? Snoop? What the hell is going on?

TL;DR – Husband’s friend sent a suspicious text, now I’m questioning if he has a second phone.

**UPDATE:** So I looked everywhere for a second phone (house and car) and I couldn't find anything anywhere. My husband was in the shower so I checked his phone to make sure I saw the message correctly and it was gone. I'm really confused."
fdzm9q,I (32 F) work overnights. My father-in-law (60s M) keeps bad mouthing me and telling everyone I'm lazy.

My sleep schedule has always been nocturnal, so this feels more natural to me than working days and brings my stress down.  My husband is gone 5 days out of the week as a truck driver, and my days off are the same days he's home thanks to my seniority, and we are both night owls during this period.

My mother-in-law recently passed away, so my father-in-law sold everything and moved to where we were and has been included in my family events. At Christmas, my brother pulled me aside to let me know that my father-in-law is telling anyone who will listen that I am lazy because I 'sleep all day.'

I work 12-24 hour shifts at my job during the days I am working. The only reason I get my days off to align with my husband is the seniority I have, and even then I often have to work when he's home.

I've now noticed that, along with him calling me, I am starting to miss calls around 2 or 3 pm from family members who know I am home and are asking me to do things for them during the day. I am usually asleep by noon and have to be up for work around 8 or 9 pm. I've sat these people down to explain that I am an overnight emergency worker and that I need my sleep.

My husband sat my father-in-law down and explained to him what I do, how I need my sleep, and that he's being a jerk. My father-in-law maintains that a real job doesn't have overnights. I don't want to have to cut contact with him because we are the only family he has left. My husband stands behind me and says if I want to cut him out even just to let him have a time out, he's game.

I also don't know how to address my whole family about this. My Mom combats it as much as possible, but his way of thinking is starting to permeate them, too.

TL;DR: I am emergency medical personnel that works 3rd shift. My father in law thinks I'm lazy and is starting to infect some of my family with that idea. How do I combat this?  


Edit: Thank you for all the comments. I wasn't expecting this to blow up. I posted it and went to sleep, thinking I'd have a few good replies. I'm on PTO for the next few days, so I will be taking some of this advice and talking to the problematic folks."
ix84tt,UPDATE to 'Should I (27/M) tell my friend (25/M) that I didn’t realize we were dating?',23254,0.93,458,2020-09-22 01:34:39,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ix84tt/update_to_should_i_27m_tell_my_friend_25m_that_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ix84tt/update_to_should_i_27m_tell_my_friend_25m_that_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"[Here's the original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivh400/should_i_27m_tell_my_friend_25m_that_i_didnt/)

So we had our dinner/movie night yesterday and I was very nervous. Mostly because I was scared that how new it was to me was going to be a deal-breaker. But Erik came over and I think he instantly realised I was acting weird. He didn’t say anything while he was helping me cook but then when we sat down to eat he almost immediately asked what was up. So I basically said something like  “I really like you and I wanna see where this goes, but I want you to know it’s very new to me and I’m not sure you’re cool with that”. And he asked what exactly was new to me and I said I’d only dated girls before. Which then lead to a conversation where I couldn’t avoid telling him that I didn’t realize we were dating until that lunch. He actually got really quiet for a few seconds after that and I was scared he was upset but then he just laughed. 

Basically, he thought I’d been flirting with him for quite some time (looking back I probably was, just not intentionally) and all of his friends had been saying like “he seems so into you, it’s really obvious, he’s probably just too shy to make the first move”. He even mentioned some other stuff we or I had done that I gotta admit definitely doesn't sound platonic when he retells it, so I can see why they thought that and ultimately they were right I guess. And during that lunch he’d apparently thought I was reaching to grab his hand so he reached out too, otherwise he probably wouldn’t have done it because he said he's never been good at making the first move physically. He said when he asked me to dinner that was a huge deal and his friends had tried to hype him up for a while and that's probably why I didn't realize that he was asking me out since he was super nervous. 

Anyway, we ended up talking *a lot* after dinner. He didn’t come out publicly (aside from a few close friends) until a year or so ago either, so he definitely understood that I don’t have a lot of experience. He hasn’t had a lot of relationships in general (at least not any proper and public ones) since he hadn’t come out and it’s a pretty conservative area so there aren’t a lot of guys who’re out of the closet here. He actually admitted that he’d even been nervous to talk to me that first time we met since I looked kind of lumberjack-y (his words not mine, though the day we met I think I hadn’t shaved in a while so I don’t doubt it) and he also knows rumors travel fast here, especially when someone doesn’t really fit in, so I guess he was worried that I’d fit the small town conservative type or have heard all the gossip. The whole 'it's a date' thing for example would never happen between two guys who are just friends here. I’ve definitely noticed the culture and it’s something we talked about too since being out here isn’t always easy, so we might try to keep it lowkey at first and mostly tell his friends and some of mine. 

I could probably ramble on about him and what we talked about for a long time, but to keep it short it was a really nice talk and we want to take it slow but we also realize we’ve basically been half-dating since May, so it felt weird not to make it official. So I guess I’ve got a boyfriend now, thanks guys :)

TL;DR The talk went great, we discussed all the misunderstandings and he had no issues with me never having dated a guy before, especially since he hasn't been out for long. So we're officially together now!

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but I truly appreciate all the kind words and I'm really happy you found some joy in this story that just started with me being oblivious and confused. I might actually have to show this to Erik because all the support is making me really emotional over here!

**EDIT 2:** I’m kind of shocked at the number of comments on here, I thought there were a lot just when I went to bed a few hours ago. It’s overwhelming in a lot of different ways to say the least. I only started using Reddit for renovation advice and that usually gets me a few helpful comments, so I guess that’s what I thought would happen here too. Thank you for all of your love though. I’ll try to respond to a few questions later when I’m not feeling as overwhelmed, but I’m sorry that I can’t answer you all.

**EDIT 3**: Okay, last update before I logout. I’m very overwhelmed in a lot of different ways and I think it’s best for my anxiety to exit this now. I know it sounds silly since I posted on here asking for comments but I’m just not good at getting attention and I didn’t expect more than a handful of helpful comments since that’s what I usually get on my main account when I ask about renovations. I guess I should’ve prepared for the small chance that a lot of people saw this but after my original post got about 10 or so comments I didn’t think much of it when posting the update. 

I looked through some of the comments and messages though and I wanted to answer some of the main questions at least: 

- I’m not American and no, English isn’t my first language. The only reason I added that to my main post is because sometimes on my main account there would be phrases or names of tools I just don’t understand or know the word for. I see now maybe that wasn’t needed here and I’m sorry if it confused any of you. I studied English for many years but school English is very different from internet and every day English. I know my grammar pretty well and basic vocabulary, but I couldn’t do my job in English. 

- Some people asked where I lived and how it could be so conservative. It's just a small town culture that I can't quite explain. Everyone knows everyone, false rumours spread easily, there are some people who're known to cause trouble who grew up here and think they own the place. On top of that just the general attitude towards everything is very old-fashioned. It's not hard to avoid, but still worrying. 

- I don’t use this subreddit. People have mentioned like 5 different posts that are apparently very similar, but based on how many people in the comments have also been in this situation maybe it’s pretty common. I genuinely don’t know what you want me to say to that except I haven’t read them and I can’t seem find them either. I can only speak for myself and you can choose to believe me or not, that’s up to you. I got the advice I needed and that's all that matters to me at least. 

- I know this might sound very love-story or movie like, but in reality it’s just me realizing I like someone and wanting to start a relationship with him. My life isn’t very exciting and I prefer it that way, which is why I’m very happy I made this a throwaway account so I can go back to my regular stuff haha! 

And while this is making me quite anxious, I don’t regret posting it. Reading other people’s stories has been very emotional and I wish I could handle going through all of them, but I don’t think that would be good for me right now. Just know I appreciate all the advice and love. I didn’t want to bring this up because it seemed irrelevant, but after my last breakup I was probably at my absolute lowest point and I never expected that I would get to a place where I’m feeling this hopeful, at least not this fast. So again, thank you so much and maybe I’ll update this in the future if something happens, but right now I’m happy to leave it at this!"

Sorry if this is super long...

My sister wasn't around much when I was growing up because she was in college then medical school. She'd visit on holidays and the weekends if she wasn't busy. Whenever she'd visit she would spend a lot of time with me and she'd take me places, buy me things and give me advice when I needed it. I always felt like I could tell her anything and she wouldn't judge me for it. She never really got along with our parents and I never knew what it was about but they would argue often and there was always a lot of tension around them. My parents were very loving and we get along so no issues there.

When she started dating her now  husband she spent less time with me and she would come over less often. 5 years ago she got married to the guy.  I don't like him at all. He's like an overgrown frat guy and he's always teasing me or saying dumb shit, he can never read the room. I've spoken to my sister about it but she says that it's just his way of bonding with people and that he means well and is a nice guy. He's been a pain in the ass for 5 years and just when I was going to give him a chance he fucked it up.

My sister and her husband came over for dinner two nights ago and were going to sleep over because they live 2 hours away. He took that as an opportunity to drink as much as he wanted. He's already insufferable when sober so drunk him is even worse. My sister and I were catching up because it's been a while and I was telling her how I would like to go into the medical field like her. Jackass husband then comes in saying that it's great that I want to follow in my mom's footsteps. My mom has never worked in the medical field so I was confused and thought he was just being dumb but my sister's face went so pale and my parents were very quiet. I just looked at my sister and could tell that it wasn't just a dumb comment. I locked myself in my room and didn't come out until the next day. There was a lot of yelling and I just learned something huge so I didn' want to deal with it.

When I finally decided to leave the room I saw that my sister was sitting right outside the door and that jerk was gone. I asked her wtf was going on and told her not to lie to me or I'll never speak to her again. She told me that she got pregnant in her senior year of high school and the guy cut all contact with her. She wanted to keep me and our parents were fully supportive of her. She found out that she got into her dream school but she would have to either give up the school or give me up. She couldn't choose so she decided to keep both. She spoke to our parents about it and the plan was to have them take care of me while she's in school and when can she will take me back. I was supposed to grow up knowing that she is my mom but because she was so busy and stressed out she didn't think that she could handle motherhood. Our parents noticed that she was pulling away so they adopted me and raised me as theirs. She said that she was young and dumb at the time so she agreed with the adoption.  She said that she thought of dropping out and taking me back so many times but thought I was better off without her as a mom.

As the years went by she saw less reason to tell me since I was doing good and was being well taken care of. She started crying and telling me that she regrets her decision and wants to be my mom even though I'm almost an adult she wants us to start over as mother and son. I told her I'd think about it and then she left. I went to speak to my parents. They told me that they did everything for me because they love me and I'm not obligated to leave now that I know. They said that things don't have to change if I don't want them to. It seemed more like they didn't want things to change.

I feel like my whole life is a lie. I know that I was well taken care of and I don't want to seem ungrateful but I was lied to my whole life. I don't see myself calling my sister ""mom"" and living life as if everything is ok. My parents are the ones who raised me so how could I just leave them like that. On the other hand if I don't decide to go with my sister she might feel like I'm rejecting her or that I hate her and after 17 years she might really give up on me. I'm so torn and feel betrayed. I can't believe that I found out from that asshole. That makes me even more mad.  I feel like I have to pick a side I don't know how to do that. I kinda just wanna run away and forget about all of this. Everyone is kinda leaving it up to me and I don't even know what I want for breakfast on a good day.

How do I approach this without everyone getting hurt?"

Well, here goes... not a great update.

I took a number of suggestions on what to bring up to him and how to have the conversation about my concerns. He did the usual thing of trying to brush it off. I persisted, much more than I have before. Eventually I got my wish, he finally told the truth. Not easily, mind, this was a several hours long ordeal. He did NOT want to come clean about anything.

He has a weight gain fetish. Not me or someone else gaining weight, which I already knew was a thing, but HIM gaining weight. He's been doing all of this on purpose, for years. He said the beginning was unintentional, just eating too much junk at college. Then he realized he liked it. He also realized if he let himself balloon too much I might bail. He didn't want to lose me. So he had enough self control to keep it at a moderate level, until I accepted his proposal last year. That was apparently the green light he needed to throw restraint to the wind and start pursuing this fetish full speed ahead.

I never had a single inkling of suspicion the entire time. I guess I can't blame myself for that because dramatic weight gain is usually for the reasons I assumed... depression or stress or bad habits or just getting comfortable and not caring. You never hear of sexual motivations. I still feel like a complete and utter fool. Like I got played, hard. This was NOT what I thought I was marrying into.

When, if ever, was he going to tell me? He claims he ""would have when it was the right time"". What does that mean? Next week? Doubt it. Years in the future when we maybe have kids? More likely.

Oh and the reluctance to do anything requiring getting off the internet that I mentioned? That's because he's posting in forums and discord fetish communities talking about it. All these people share weight gain tips and compare ""progress pictures"" of their bellies and write pornographic roleplay stories. I'm truly disgusted. I've obliviously been sat right next to him countless times while he gets off in his own little world. 

He has even discussed with random strangers how to keep me in the dark. Apparently the most common suggestion was ""play dumb and make it into a running joke"", so there's my explanation for why he constantly dismissed anything I said. Unbelievable.

This has been going on right under my nose for years. I really cannot fathom how I could be so clueless. And that the person I thought I knew had the gall, to not only intentionally make himself obese, but to hide his motivations from me, seek out advice on how to do that, and lie to me over and over when I attempted to talk about my worry.

I expressed how I felt seriously betrayed, like our relationship had been built on a false pretense without my knowledge. He did apologize sincerely. He said he would ""try"" to lose weight. I asked why is he only saying that now? Why did he refuse to discuss let alone change anything all the other times I asked what was up? Leaving me to be confused and worried instead. He didn't have an answer. He just begged me to give him one chance and promised he'd stop and get healthier.

My problem is, I just don't know if I can believe that. And even if he follows through I don't know if I can get over being lied to. For years. 

I was so dumbfounded that I asked him to leave today (the conversation was last night) so I could collect my thoughts. He'll be back tomorrow night.

100% sure I want to call off the engagement. 80% sure I want to just bite the bullet and end the relationship. Fuck this. I absolutely love this man. Why did he have to do this.

TL;DR: He has a fetish about gaining weight that he kept secret since college. Has been putting himself at risk deliberately. I'm in shock and will be calling off the wedding. TBD whether I give him a chance to prove he can change and be trustworthy, but I don't feel like it's likely."
iiscjb,My (27/F) cousin (27/F) confessed that she was in love with my husband (29/F). She’s currently living with us and I have no idea how to act.,23027,0.95,2102,2020-08-29 18:56:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iiscjb/my_27f_cousin_27f_confessed_that_she_was_in_love/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iiscjb/my_27f_cousin_27f_confessed_that_she_was_in_love/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"opps I made a typo in the title sorry! I meant husband (29/M)\*\*

Literally what the title says.

My cousin has been living with us for the past four months along with her toddler so she can save up to get her own place. Yesterday, whilst my husband was out, she asked me if we could talk. I thought she was going to ask me if she could stay a little while longer (the original plan was for 6 months) but instead she gave me a long speech about how she was in love with my husband, how she tried to make the feelings go away but they keep getting stronger and how she thinks he might be her soulmate. She kept apologizing but said that when she sees him with her son, she knows her family is complete and he could offer her and her son the stability they need. I was honestly so shocked I just  said “Uh, I need time to process this”. I’ve been avoiding her since, my husband has been holed up in his office working so he hasn’t noticed anything weird yet. I think I’m still reeling from the shock.

I can’t even ask her to move out because her family disowned her when she had a baby out of wedlock. I haven’t told anyone in real life yet either because I know they’re all just going to tell me to kick her out but I can’t make my nephew homeless during a pandemic.

What do I do?

TL;DR – my cousin, who is staying with us for another two months, thinks my husband is her soulmate. I have no idea how to act around her now. Help.

Edit: I wrote it in the comments already but just to add she claims she's had these feelings for at least 4 years and they've just grown so strong recently that she couldn't keep it in anymore. Also, her son is 18 months!

UPDATE: I spoke to my husband. He was shocked and a little uncomfortable. He apologised and said he didn't mean to give her the wrong impression. Neither of us are quite sure what we're going to do yet since he also doesn't want to leave my nephew homeless. We're discussing it. I wasn't going to update until we'd solved the issue but literally every comment is telling me to tell him so just to let you guys know I have!!"
g9j503,My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous.,23026,0.95,3259,2020-04-28 13:34:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9j503/my_20f_sisters_28f_behaviour_towards_my_boyfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9j503/my_20f_sisters_28f_behaviour_towards_my_boyfriend/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,,False,"This is going to be long. I'm warning you. I'm angry. I'm frustrated and I'm shaking. I need to write it down and hear some advice.

My sis is just so creepy towards my bf. I can't take it anymore. She was really spoiled by my parents when she was young because she was their first child. She always WANTS everything and when we were little, she always used to steal my toys/books/clothes etc. I was never allowed to touch any of her things but she constantly stole my stuff and was always rude to me. My mom for some reason has always preferred her over me and thus, most of the time, I was told to let it go.

Due to this, I have lots of resentment towards her and I don't really like her. I'm honestly sick of her behaviour, and I just want some peace and quiet in my house. 

My mom called me two weeks ago, pleading to let my sis stay with me because she doesn't have a job right now and she can't stay alone during quarantine. Both my parents are high risk. My mom has heart problems and my dad is asthmatic. So I thought I should let her stay with me and my bf instead of letting her go to my parents in case she infects them. There's been a few cases where she is so I didn't want to risk it.

Now I'm honestly starting to regret it. Her behaviour is creepy and strange and downright disgusting. First of all, she doesn't respect me at all. She's constantly ignoring me while having long talks with my boyfriend. She doesn't leave my boyfriend alone!

She flirts with him and constantly tries to touch him by using cheap tricks. When we watch movies, she pushes me away and tries to snuggle with my boyfriend. She slaps his butt when he walks by and loudly tells him how he has a ""perky little butt"" She also runs her fingers through his hair everyday saying ""Whoaaa your hair is so soft"" or some shit like that. WHAT THE FUCK. 

These are all just excuses to touch him. She just needs a chance. Another thing she does is ask him if he has abs so she can touch his torso. Or say ""did you see this thing I lost, maybe it's in your pocket let me see"" and proceed to pat his thighs. 

One time she wanted help with hooking her bra and she just fucking walks out in her underwear. She came to our room and my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The logical thing to do is just fucking ask ME I'm her sister! But what does she do? She just waits for my boyfriend and asks him instead even though I'm sitting right there!

I think I looked VERY upset because my boyfriend just told her no and she went back to her room. She didn't try that again.

This is not even all. My boyfriend and I can't even talk to each other without her interrupting us. She barges into our room with no warning. A few days ago, we were trying to have sex and I don't know how the fuck she realized it and starting banging on the door claiming to have a headache. 

I opened the door and asked her what was wrong. I told her I had pills for it but she just said she doesn't trust me and she wanted to talk to my boyfriend instead. After disturbing us, she was suddenly completely fine and her headache disappeared miraculously. She just came into our bedroom and started talking to my boyfriend. We were literally half naked and there was no way she didn't know! 

This is driving me crazy. What does she want? Why is she like this? It's not like I didn't talk to her. I was so angry she interrupted us because she has been doing this since she came here. I was feeling horny and angry. I just told her to get out and that we needed some alone time. I don't want to go into details but we had a small argument and she started crying. 

The thing is she never accepts it! She's completely blind to what she's doing. She denies doing it and sheds tears which ends up making me feel bad instead.

My boyfriend is so uncomfortable by all of this. He just looks exhausted all the time. He's trying his best to be nice but she's all over him all the time. He's usually very introverted/shy/quiet. He's not very confrontational and I know this is bothering him. When I talked to him about it, he just commented that it was a bad idea to invite her to stay here. He also said not to invite her ever again.

I want to know why she is like this. How can I make her see what she's doing? I'm done dealing with her. I don't want to see her ever again, but she's my parents' favourite child and no matter how hard I try, I can never escape her. Whenever I try to cut contacts with her, my mom calls me and begs me to forgive her. My mom doesn't want to see her daughters fighting with each other and she always says how she wants us to be together forever.

But I can't do this. How am I supposed to deal with this? Can someone please tell me. My mom is always taking my sister's side in everything and it's always me who has to be ""understanding"" and ""smart"" and ""older"" when I'M THE YOUNGER ONE HERE!

Please tell me I'm not overreacting. How do I make my mom and sister realize that I'm sick of dealing with this? 

TL;DR : my sis tries to flirt with bf and keeps touching him all over the place. she doesn't accept that what she's doing is wrong and i'm sick of her behaviour. how do I deal with this?"
iygsli,My (26F) fiancé (27M) left me for his “one that got away” four years ago.

They quickly got engaged, married and had a baby before it had even been a year. I was so blindsided and hurt, I don’t think I ever really got over my ex which is why I’m making this post to get some outside insight. 

My ex reached out a few days ago to “catch up”. He claimed he regretted breaking up with me two months after he did but because his ex-wife was pregnant at the time, he felt he owed it to his son to try and make it work. He said their relationship quickly fell apart when he realized his ex wasn’t looking for a life partner but someone to financially support her. He said the financial issues is what finally led to their divorce. They’ve been divorced for 6 months and have two children together. According to him, his ex regularly tries to get back together with him, but he doesn’t want her.

He ended up asking me if I was willing to give him a second chance. 

In some ways, my ex has become my “one who got away” and I probably would’ve jumped at the chance to get back with him a few months ago. However, I’ve recently been talking to this guy and whilst we aren’t official or anything, we did go on a date two weeks ago which went really well. I feel like it could progress into something good and I don’t know if my ex is worth losing it over. 

I’d appreciate any advice on what to do in this situation. 

TL;DR – My ex left me for his “one that got away”. Four years and two kids later, they’re now divorced. My ex claims he regretted leaving me two months after he did but felt like he had to stay for the sake of his unborn child. He now wants a second chance, but I’ve met someone knew who seems like a great person. I don’t know what to do."

Thank you guys for the responses. 

I tried talking to her again and she apologized but I could tell that she wasn't really sorry. She only did it because she ""had to"" if that makes sense. I asked her how she would respond if we had a son and god forbid something happened to him. She didn't even respond. It reminded me of the way my parents responded when I told them. Crickets. I was 13 when I told them. In fact they still keep contact with the woman, a family friend who was like an aunt to me. 

I broke up with her and explained to her why. She was pissed. Called me every name in the book and said that it's fine because she didn't even like me that much anyway. I don't know how much of that is true or if she's saying it out of anger but I don't care. Any doubt I felt about breaking up vanished with her response. I was fully willing to work on our relationship and give it another shot but I guess I cared more about her than she did about me. 

I'm gonna stay with my sister for now. I think I need to be single. For some reason I've always been quick to jump into relationships and they all fail. My now ex gf and I had some other issues that we've tried working through but I can't work through this. I'm just gonna focus on myself moving forward. I've heard everything she's said before from both men and women but having it directed at me from someone I care about really hurt. It's not something I could let go.I've dealt with a lot of confusion and guilt surrounding what happened that made me question myself. I didn't like what was happening to me but my body would react. This really messed me up.

I'm gonna work through my issues before I even think of another relationship."
a492j5,I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,22854,0.9,7847,2018-12-08 13:58:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/,self.relationship_advice,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

ih3qov,UPDATE: Just found out my (23M) best friend (23M) has been secretly dating my ex (24F) for months,22668,0.94,673,2020-08-26 23:25:30,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ih3qov/update_just_found_out_my_23m_best_friend_23m_has/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ih3qov/update_just_found_out_my_23m_best_friend_23m_has/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i32pxe/just_found_out_my_23m_best_friend_23m_has_been/)

I kind of debated if I’d post an update on this or not. It’s been a few weeks and some stuff has happened, but as the post blew up I got a good number of really shitty comments that informed me I was a worthless piece of shit, that I should beat up my ex girlfriend, or alternately that I was probably already some kind of horrible abuser who hated her and wanted to control her body.

I also got a ton of love, support, PMs offering connections on housing, and more, but being I was already in a dark and desperate place, those other comments really twisted the knife. I had to spend some time away not just fixing my shit but also avoiding that stuff, because it was really not making me want to move forward. For anyone who’s reading this while in the middle of a situation, wondering if you should post your story, my advice is: don’t. Wait till you have some distance, or it’s just going to make things worse.

One thing I want to clarify here, since a few people swung for the fences based on what I posted: I don’t hate Cassie. I don’t think she shouldn’t move on. I don’t blame her for dating someone else after I broke up with her. I do have a lot of anger still thinking about this. All that anger is at Ryan. That’s it. Ryan is the one who lied to me and went behind my back, not Cassie. My post pretty clearly stated that I think Cassie is an awesome human being. Still think so. Period. We just wanted different things. 

So, actual updates.

Shortly after I posted, Ryan texted me to say that he’d planned to give me a month to find somewhere else to live, but since I “couldn’t be happy for them” he wanted me out by Friday. Looking back on it, I kinda think this was his plan all along. Cassie’s parents own the apartment I lived in with her, so we paid bills on it but no rent. Ryan’s apartment was expensive and his parents still paid some of his bills there, so I suspect he was looking for an excuse to break his lease and get in on that free rent instead.

But **I have a place to live now**. Reddit helped me out after all, in a weird way. A couple days after I posted, this guy TJ hit me up on FB (hey TJ) with the link to my post asking if it was me. TJ and I weren’t close friends before all this, but he recognized some of the details. 

Skipping some back and forth, it turns out Ryan lied to all our mutual friends about the situation. Apparently he hooked up with Cassie the first time about a week after we split up. He asked some of our friends what to do and they all told him to make sure I was cool first thing. He then told them he had talked to me and that I was happy for him. So, when I started freaking out a couple months later, my friends all thought I was “going crazy out of nowhere” over something I’d known about for months.

Once they found out what really happened, I got a lot of apology texts. Some of them I’ve accepted. Some are still on read. A couple of guys offered me crash space or help moving, and I wound up staying with TJ, but only till I could find somewhere else.

My days of living in places without my name on a lease are over. Learned my lesson there. I found a roommate looking for a place through Craigslist and we signed the lease last week. Moving from TJ’s happens this weekend.

Ryan is blocked out of my life. I probably forgot some of my stuff at either his place or Cassie’s, but it’s whatever. I can get new stuff. I can get new friends. More than anything else this situation made me realize the importance of having stable, independent housing and not counting on anyone else to do the right thing by me. I have to have my own back in life, not rely on others.

That’s about all I’ve got. It’s nothing dramatic, I guess. No one was hit by a car, got pregnant, or turned out to be cheating. But I’ve never been so glad to have a roof over my head and a bed to come back to. I’m going to keep going from here, keep working on life, and I’m sure as hell going to be taking a break on the dating front. That’s all there is to do."

I’m trying my best to lose weight but I think losing any more is a bad idea as I’m very skinny now. It’s upsetting when he claims that I’m overweight all of the time even though I completely cut out junk food from my diet and jog for at least an hour a day.

hc7p4w,[UPDATE] I (30F) found out my husband (32M) hired my friend (26F) to strip at his bachelor party,22648,0.9,2852,2020-06-20 01:33:04,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hc7p4w/update_i_30f_found_out_my_husband_32m_hired_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hc7p4w/update_i_30f_found_out_my_husband_32m_hired_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"
TL;DR last post I found out my husband had actually hired strippers for his bachelor party, not only that but he had gone out of his way to hire Rebecca (a close friend) and they hid this for four years.

Is it too soon to update?

I confronted them both, separately, they both gave two *very different* stories 

Rebecca says that my husband got drunk, groped her and when she refused he pushed her and started to yell at her, apparently my husband and his friends believe I shouldn’t be friends with her because she “lead them on”

My husband says that they didn’t sleep together **but** Rebecca tried to initiate and performed oral while he was black out drunk.

I’m staying with my parents because I don’t know who to believe here or if I should I should even believe either of them, all I’ve done is argue with my husband since the confession.

I’m left more confused than ever and honestly, I just want to say f the both of them, but if my husbands story is true then he’s totally innocent, but what if Rebecca is telling the truth? What if neither of them are.

I’m sick of them both, I haven’t stopped crying since arriving at my mothers to be honest and I don’t think I can.

Why would he hide this for 4 years? Why would she?! If they both believe they’re fully innocent/victims here? 

My husband *is* a mean drunk, but he’s always so soft spoken and I don’t know if he can do those things Rebecca claimed, but I  don’t know how he reacts around his friends, but I’ve known him longer than Rebecca too? But I’m all for believing women, I feel like by agreeing with my husband I’m denying Rebeccas story/side."

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course. 


Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We’re moving in together so I’m thinking I’ll bring her out. 


Mom: Oh that’s nice. First week of December maybe? 


Me: Sure. Look there’s one thing though. She’s not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we’re done, we’re going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. 


Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


Me: No. This is exactly what I’m talking about. 


Mom: Fine. I’m just happy I finally get to meet her. 


Dad: *Insulting weight related comment*


Me: What the fuck dad? 


Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can’t be that bad. 


Me: No if there’s any chance of that sort of commentary, I’ll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You’re going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won’t get the chance to screw it up. 


Dad: *Insulting joke* 



Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you’ve heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



Mom: No, wait, I’ll make sure his act is together by the time you’re out here. 


Dad: *Insulting comment* 



Me: I’m hanging up. 


So it looks like I’m going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said “It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won’t be possible and it definitely isn’t worth putting you through this.”

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it’s a non issue it turns out. 


*tl;dr: My dad couldn’t even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we’re just going to let this go for now.*"
c3c2s3,My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,22424,0.91,3041,2019-06-21 21:03:41,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3c2s3/my_wife_cheating_on_our_10_year_anniversary/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3c2s3/my_wife_cheating_on_our_10_year_anniversary/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance."

Whenever I start a new relationship I start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. I’m a big romantic so I intend on using this money, in the event this girl is “the one”, towards an engagement ring far down the road. Subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, I cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. Is this idea brilliant or am I putting too much attention on these extremes?"
a9jdy7,I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.,22173,0.96,1585,2018-12-26 05:00:58,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9jdy7/i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no_regrets/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9jdy7/i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no_regrets/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Is anyone else’s family this dysfunctional? Every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years I was the one who blew up for the first time. 

Long story short, i’m half-Korean/half-white. My mom is Korean. My dad side is white. So we only have my Dad’s side here in the US. For years, I watched my some of my dad’s side speak down to my mom. They never invite her to things. Me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. To be frank, I don’t care how i’m treated. Every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it’s only 2-3 times a year. We repeat the process and don’t expect much from these family members. My mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. My white Grandma is 80 and she’s the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

Three times today I watched a family member (Aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn’t speak english and shut her down over simple questions like “where should I sit?”. I watched my mom quietly recoil and I couldn’t stand to see it again. This aunt does it the most and I finally blew up. I yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. I told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. To stop speaking to my mom (who’s lived in the US for 35 years) like she doesn’t speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. I watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

My Aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. As she was leaving I walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom’s yearly gift to her. I said  “for 30 years I watched my mom give you a gift every year. I watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. I’ve never seen you treat her with the same”.  She didn’t say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

Before I left, I apologized to everyone and explained why I was upset. Everyone was shocked how mad I got. I felt like everyone understood why I was mad.  Prior to this (around thanksgiving) I spoke to some family members about how I was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. Which they have been trying to do more. 

After blowing up, it made things awkward. People trickled out early too. Now my grandma is talking about not doing Christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. I feel bad, but i’ve never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. Does anyone have any advice on this? Handling rude family?  Should I do something else? 


[Edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below]

Mom’s reaction: On the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. She’s always taken the high road it’s a very Korean Christian mom approach. My mom’s method of being a pacifist is very much an older Immigrant/Korean/boomer approach too. It’s taught me a valuable skill in life. I don’t regret picking my battles and that’s why i’m so appreciative of being Korean/white. After we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. She didn’t say anything and asked me if I wanted my favorite Korean dish. 

Where is my dad: He was in the other room. Yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. He’s gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. We’d be fighting every year with someone new if we didn’t pick our battles. We would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. My dad is the only one who isn’t petty about dumb shit. Defending my mom is everyone’s responsibility not just my dad. Including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. As soon as I got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (I can’t describe it). There wasn’t much for him to say or do because he didn’t hear it. I was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. My white side has a “keep grandma” happy approach which is dumb. For years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn’t. 

Me: Reflecting on this as a whole. I can’t believe the response. It shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. After Thanksgiving I started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. I have no relationship with this aunt. I should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who’s 30 years younger. A small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. If she’s not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), “F*ck her”.  Please don’t use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. I should have tried to speak and I did what I felt was right, I don’t regret it.. Grandma’s 80th Bday is in two months.  I can’t wait for that to be awkward. Someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. Regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. Cheers and have a Happy New Years!

TLDR: After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my Korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. How do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. Should I do something for blowing up?"

So this was not a big post at all, but one or two people asked for an update if there were any and so here I am again. 

For a quick recap: I am possibly going to rent the entire 4 bedroom apartment I currently sublet a room in sometime around September/October and two of my best friends are moving in. My friend Layla has gotten pregnant and were planning to move in with me and have the three of us taking care of the baby, as physically and financially. 

I took the advice someone gave to talk to my other future roommate Indy about it, and we both agreed that it was not something we wanted to do at all, and we decided to confront her about it together so she could understand it wasn't going to happen.

We got together at my place on Tuesday and had some tea. We just sat down and said that basically we were very worried about her and the scenario that she had in her head about us raising the baby together is just completely irresponsible and we don't want that at all. We decided to not lay out the whole thing about her mental health, job situation and all that because we didn't want it to feel like an attack on her but more just us setting some boundaries. 
She got really emotional and told us that she knew it was ridiculous but she was scared and in shock and really didn't know how to react or think straight. Apparently it wasn't even her idea to begin with but some of her other friends we don't know very well who came up with it and sorta pressured her to feel a certain way because they were extremely excited for her. 
She just said that she has been crying every day since she found out and she's so scared for the future and really just want everything to go back to normal. At that point we just said that we totally understand and we of course will be there for her no matter what she decides to do, but we really also felt that it would be a lot for her to be a mom under these circumstances. 

So yeah. She decided getting an abortion would be the best thing for her. She said her initial reaction was to terminate the pregnancy but she had a lot if guilt associated with that as she has been brought up in a very conservative family
I'd rather not hear anything about the morals of that decision, as I don't think that would really be helpful to the conversation. We told her that we would be with her every step of the way if she needed it, and so we both went with her to the doctors on Thursday to confirm she was pregnant and to find out the options. Since she is only 6 weeks pregnant she could get some pills to take over a 48 hour period and that would make the embryo detach. She got the first one at the hospital on Friday where we were there with her too, and then they both stayed over at my place the whole weekend for the rest of it since her parents still doesn't know and she didn't want to tell them. 
My roommate is conveniently on holiday with some of her friends for the rest of the week so we had the whole place to ourselves and nothing to explain to anyone. 
She took the other pill yesterday and everything seems to be going smoothly, she just has a heavy period basically, which coincidentally ligned up with both Indys and mine (TMI sorry) so we have all been laying in my bed with heating pads and Netflix being a little miserable together, but things are going well and the pain have not been too much for just regular painkillers. 
There has been some crying, lots of hugs and long talks and walks in the forrest and I feel like things are going to be okay. They're both staying here until my roommate gets back so she can get through this in a comfy environment without having to pretend nothing is wrong. 

So yeah, it seems like the plan of moving in together is back on as originally planned, and everything will be okay. Layla was offered some counseling at the hospital about getting through an abortion and the feelings about it which she is starting some time next week.

Thank you so so much for the people who gave me advice when I needed it. This outcome is better than I could have imagined and I wouldn't have thought of doing it this way if it wasn't for you guys so thank you ❤❤


Edit: 

This got a lot more attention than I thought it would, given that my original post had 7 upvotes and 9 comments, so a bit of an overwhelming read this morning, but thank you to everyone for commenting, I've read them all and I'm very moved by the overwhelming positivity! It feels really nice to know that you guys think we made the right call in going about it this way, and it means a lot to me that you think we are good friends ❤

I figured I'd just respond to some of the main comments/questions that I've received a lot so its all just here at the top.

So first off about getting an STI test; she already had that as part of the initial examination and she was all clear thank God!

Second about getting birth control, then she was apparently using condoms, which I didn't know when I made the original post, so correction there. Birth control pills are not an option as they don't react well with the particular type of medication she is already on. 

About her other friends, the ones who came up with the idea of us raising the baby together; a lot of people commented on how shitty friends they are, and I agree which is why they aren't my friends. Layla still likes them but she wants some distance. They have all grown up in the same church environment so I think she excuses their behavior because of that. They don't see abortion as an option so I think they were just trying to comfort her and look for a solution, though out of touch with reality. A lot of people suggested to tell them she had a miscarriage but we decided that telling them it was just a false pregnancy would be better because knowing them I would be worried that they might throw a memorial party or something of the sort for her and I just don't think that would be helpful at all. We've written a draft for the group text she has with them but I think she will wait a bit to send it out. Indy and I are just staying silent on the matter, I don't feel like it is my story to tell or not tell and I wouldn't be comfortable lying about it, so as far as we are concerned, she just had a false positive pregnancy test and that's all we know.

Someone brought up about health insurance and if it would be possible that her parents could find out that way, but we live in a country with a free health care system so that was thankfully not a concern. 

And lastly; some people brought up that she shouldn't move in because she sounds unreliable and irresponsible. I will definitely agree that she was out of touch with reality for a while there but seeing how difficult of a time this has been for her I really don't blame her at all. I would probably have done something equally crazy if I was in that position. I have probably also made her sound a bit worse than she is because I was pretty annoyed with her when I wrote the first post. She is normally a very responsible and reliable and I trust her completely with moving in as I wouldn't have asked her in the first place if I didn't think she could find a job and pay rent, just I did not think she would be able to do that with a child too. 

On just a final note; I didn't really want to have the morals of the decision to terminate the pregnancy discussed but I guess that's inevitable. I'm surprised by the number of people being supportive and finding comfort in the way we went about it and talking about their own experiences. That makes me happy to see. 
To the people who disagree then I'm not going to have that discussion. It's not my choice to make or to decide between right and wrong and if you want to judge me or my friends for making the choices we thought to be right then you can just go ahead and do that.

To everyone wishing us the best I wish you the best right back and I'll make sure to give her hugs from all of you ❤"

In the very early hours of this morning, I hear someone calling me name from the gate. Get up, look outside and see my daughter in law standing outside with a bag and a pram holding my grandchildren. I obviously let her in and ask what's wrong. She didn't want to talk so I gave her space and took the kids to sleep in my room. I woke up at around 6 and she was still up. She couldn't get a hold of her parents so she finally decided to tell me what was going on. She says she was feeling sick and didn't want to have sex with my son but he pushed her and ended up just raping her against her protests. She thinking of opening a case which I support. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

Shortly afterwards I check my phone I notice I got a call from my son last night and again this morning so I called him. He was also crying and I could barely hear him but eventually he calmed down and told me he almost hit her. He says all day yesterday she was giggling and chatting on her phone with a guy she says is a friend. They argued and then left it. At night curiosity got to him and he went throught he phone and found out that she was sending nudes to some guy. He got angry, grabbed her and shook her to wake her up and got into an argument again. He threw her phone on the floor and almost hit her. She then packed up and left with the kids.

I haven't told him that she's with me because I don't know what to do. I don't want to be involved but I already am. My daughter doesn't believe her at all and says I should kick her out. I don't know. Either way he was wrong. What now?

1st Update: 

I asked her about the infidelity and she says it's all nonsense. She's now at the hospital to see what she can do and then she's going to the police station.

I've told my son that they are here and that she's opening a case. I'm not good at reading people but he did seem surprised at her story and so was she at his story. I've warned him about an upcoming trial and suggested he calls a lawyer which he says he will.

2nd Update: they're both going with their stories and are both very firm in it and are gathering evidence on both sides. I have asked my DIL if I could take her to a friend or to her family and she understood. I'm still keeping the kids with me (on her request). 

And as much as I'd love to update more specifically on what's happening, I can't but I do appreciate all the comments and have/will read them all"

Firstly, thank you everyone for your input, the “run” comment was pretty brutal but effective. I broke off the engagement three days ago via phone call. I haven’t figured out how I will return the ring but thinking by insured mail.

The call itself wasn’t horrible because I think he was in shock but a couple of highlights from the call:

- “I might have lied, fine. But you are a liar too, you lied about loving me.”

- “Not trying to guilt you but you’ve destroyed me.”

- “I have nothing now and have no idea what I’m going to do with myself.”

- “Are you seeing someone else?”

- “You’re making a huge mistake. Al I wanted was to be a good husband to you.” (2x)

These comments were hard to hear because my worst fear is that I preemptively cut off a relationship with a man who is going through active change and who loves me dearly. But at the end of the day, I realized I don’t trust that he will change genuinely and I have no idea how to measure that progress since he has proved to hide parts of himself around me.

He hasn’t tried to contact me since I broke things off and I’m grateful for that. I think it would make everything so much worse. I am grieving such an immense loss which is hard to communicate because others see it as a win by leaving an unhealthy relationship. 

Again, thanks everyone for the advice."

(I originally posted this under a throwaway account, but that account didn’t start with ThrowRA as per subreddit rules)

I finally built up the courage to confess to my best friend that I had feelings for him for the past two years.  He was really nice about it and let me down gently but in no uncertain terms.  It was a hard pill to swallow, but I accepted this and I told him I’d need some time to just get back to the right head space.  I took a week to separate myself from him and let myself recover and rebuild my self esteem, but I made sure to tell him there’s no hard feelings, I just need the space.  
Fast forward to today, I ran into him and decided to talk to him and apologize for putting him in an uncomfortable position but that I accept his feelings and I’m ready to keep continue our relationship as friends.  Except... he tells me that he took that week to think too, and he thinks he’s actually loved me for a long time but that he was too dense to recognize his own feelings until now.  
I feel like I should be elated, but for some reason my heart just really hurts.  I feel confused and unsure of what to believe.  For all the time I’ve known him, he’s never been the type to play with someone else’s feelings and has never given me any reason to think he’s lying to me now about how he feels towards me, but I don’t understand how someone can just go from having no romantic feelings towards someone to saying they’ve loved them all along in such a short time.  I feel like I’ve been asked to tear out a piece of my heart, sew it shut, and now suddenly open that same wound to put everything back the way it was!  
Should I just accept his feelings now?  Should I be wary of this?  I feel like this should be such an easy decision and yet, I just feel so confused!

UPDATE: Thank you all for all of your advice and kind comments! We met in person to talk things through and I asked him what changed.  He told me that the truth was that he’d never really felt romantically interested in anyone else before, so he genuinely didn’t really know how to distinguish a best friend from something more.  I know he’s never had a relationship before, he’s never expressed a romantic interest in anyone else, and never seemed to express a sexual attraction to someone else, so this seems to line up from what I know of him.

I asked him then how he knew for sure that he liked me as more than a friend.  He said he’d never felt this way towards anyone else: never felt nervous butterflies just wanting to see them, never felt a strange jealousy when another guy was trying to hit on them, and never felt his heart race when he accidentally brushed hands with them.  

I told him that I wanted to make sure he wasn’t confusing any guilt he may feel for turning me down for love.  He said that if he wanted to pity me he would have just said yes the first time.  

He apologized again for confusing and hurting me and said that if I still needed time he’d be willing to wait, take things slow, and keep talking more until I could figure my feelings out.  I told him I didn’t need more time to know how I felt, because I never really stopped loving him even if I had pushed those feelings down as far as I could.  I told him that I wanted to take things slow, but I wanted to do so as more than just friends.  

We talked for a while, he even told me how he actually had come to the park planning to confess and ask me out, but when he heard me apologize to him and say that I was ready to just be friends he realized it might be better to take things slow.  

Of course, at the end of all this I just sort of happy/relief cried like a dork and he just pulled me close and hugged me (though he had some happy tears himself)! We’re planning to order some food from one of our favorite restaurants and have a picnic date at the same park next week!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an ""It's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. Thanks Reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!"
d15fol,[Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,21496,0.92,895,2019-09-08 08:10:25,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d15fol/update_overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d15fol/update_overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, ""I'll remember to respect from now on."" That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice."
c1o3ou,[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,21491,0.92,389,2019-06-17 19:52:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1o3ou/update_my_ex_girlfriend_committed_suicide_i_am_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c1o3ou/update_my_ex_girlfriend_committed_suicide_i_am_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,,False,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it."
ddanvc,I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?,21482,0.95,2130,2019-10-04 23:09:14,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddanvc/i_21f_found_a_hidden_camera_in_my_house_i_suspect/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ddanvc/i_21f_found_a_hidden_camera_in_my_house_i_suspect/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same."
e4eiez,My (43M) son's (17) therapist told him it would be better to just die,21298,0.88,2817,2019-12-01 14:34:01,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e4eiez/my_43m_sons_17_therapist_told_him_it_would_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e4eiez/my_43m_sons_17_therapist_told_him_it_would_be/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Advice would be very much appreciated, but I understand if you might think that this is too much for the sub. I am simply a religious Reddit user, so I thought I might get some help.

My son has been diagnosed with Manic Depression when he was 15. He's tried to end his life three times - one time he cut his veins, the other two he overdosed on pills. He is violent towards his younger sister, mother and sometimes even me. I have heard a lot of people tell me over the years that I would be better off just letting him do his business, and I am sick and tired of it. I love my son - he is not perfect by all means, none of us are, but I would never be relieved by him dying.

His last suicide attempt was in September, and ever since we have removed his door and set alarms at night, to check on him once every half an hour. We keep medication, knifes, belts, basically any sharp thing you could think of under lock and key. He is not allowed to drive or go anywhere by himself. We are all terrified of losing him.

Ever since September, he refused to go to his past therapist, so we had to set him up with a new one. This woman is well-known in our city and has gotten nothing but stellar reviews - people praise her left and right. It was hard to get an appointment, and my wife was ecstatic when she said she could maybe squeeze him in sometimes. He has been seeing her for two months, and although the appointments didn't seem to lift his mood much, he somehow looked lighter and more at peace after each and every one. I would drive him to each one, wait for him there and drive him back home. I would ask how it went and the best answer I got was ""twas fine"". Until yesterday.

I asked him how it was, not expecting anything out of him, because he seemed more closed off than usual. The answer I got was ""She told me I would be better off just dying"". I thought it was a cruel joke on his part, but he seemed sincere. I asked him to elaborate and he just said ""Don't act like you don't want it"". I got him out of the car, barged in on her next appointment and went off on her. How could you even suggest something like that? I am paying you to help him understand how precious his life is, how much everyone around him treasures him, and you just tell him he would be better off dying? He wouldn't. He would be dead. She asked my son to wait for us to discuss it in the hallway and then proceeded to tell me that no amount of ""pills or chit-chats will help him"". That his brain is wired differently from ours and that I don't have the knowledge she has. I just left. 

I have anulled all appointments and tried to discuss it with him, but I don't know if he even listens. My wife is at her wits' end and did nothing but cry ever since I related all this to her. I don't know if, in the last 2 months, she's drilled this idea into his brain. I don't know how to make it right. I feel like everybody is conspiring against us at this point, almost like no one wants him to get better. I know this may be too big for you, because I feel it weighting heavily on all of us too.

EDIT: It has been 12 hours since posting this. I have gotten maybe the best and worst advice ever. I have been called names, but most of all you degraded my son by calling him a sociopathic murderer which... okay, armchair psychologists, you sure know best. I will discuss with my wife the possibility of inpatient and will contact my son's last therapist to ask her if we can arrange something. I will write an update when there is something to update you on. To all those offering genuine advice and criticism, as long as it's constructive, thank you so much, I will take your words to heart. I will stop responding to comments here or try to fight useless battles around. I might check the private messages from time to time, but that is it. Thank you once again!"

It was toxic, it was ""Fuck me or I'll cheat on you"" it was ""You aren't a real man if you don't do things with me. This was in the 8th-10th grade. Horrible awful shit. I have forgiven her since, I talked to her years later about it. She was being raped by her stepdad during our relationship and that violence and awful shit basically got transfered onto her and then onto me.

I finally had the guts to tell my parents about what happened to me about a year ago and to explain how that went I'll give a quote from my dad ""I don't understand how you didn't like it"". He doesn't believe a man can be raped unless by another man. But that shit really fucked me up for a long time, even to this day it still fucks me up. I can't get hard sometimes because I get such anxiety about it. One time I talked to my parents about it when I was like 20 and to this day if I ever go out with a girl, my dad will say ""Could you get it up this time?"" And laugh away. Just to give an example. I just don't know what to do, I feel like shit about it way to often to be healthy."

However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

An additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like ‘f*** me with that horse cock’. I’ve never thought much of it, I thought that was just a way of her saying it’s big. But she’s started to take it further and it’s turned into a bit of a fetish that I’m not entirely comfortable with. A few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first I was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. I laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. I said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said I’d do it the following day. Honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. I told her no, and I didn’t want to do it again and she’s back to being mad at me. Am I being a dick here? I don’t know what to do. Sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion"

My girlfriend and I were hanging out. I was playing a game and she was scrolling on her phone. We often just like to enjoy each other's company. I guess she was reading something because she just stated how it's so sad that every woman knows someone or has been someone who was sexually harassed and/or assaulted. I agreed and told her that it's horrible how many women do not feel safe in situations where they should. She then said that men are so lucky they don't deal with it. I didn't know if she was being serious at first but she kept ranting. I told her that what men go through in life definitely doesn't compare to what women go through but sexual assault is something that happens to men too. She then responded with ""all men think about is sex"".

I took that as an opportunity to open up to her and tell her about how I was taken advantage of from the ages of 7-18 by a woman who I was supposed to trust. As a kid she used to touch me or make me touch her and call it ""our little secret"". As I got older she got more ""aggressive"" with the sexual acts. It only stopped because she moved away. She kinda looked at me with a ""yeah right"" face and said that all boys dream of being with an older woman. She only agreed that it was messed up that I was so young when it started. She then said that I seemed to be ok so it's not that bad. Women who go through it have so much mental and emotional damage and that women aren't as scary as men. I honestly didn't even know what to say.

I'm not ok I guess I'm just good at hiding it.I use smoking as a coping mechanism and it's been an issue in our relationship. How do I navigate our relationship going forward? I'm not sure where this was coming from. Maybe she went through something too? Idk..."

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be ""free"". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: 



I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




Edit 30 juli: 

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another."
eqfcej,My (36F) husband (41M) has some disturbing requests for after he's passed away.,21163,0.92,1368,2020-01-18 17:00:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eqfcej/my_36f_husband_41m_has_some_disturbing_requests/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eqfcej/my_36f_husband_41m_has_some_disturbing_requests/,self.relationship_advice,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"This one is really bizarre, and I'm sorry ahead of time. My husband of 12 years has had some medical problems recently. The topic about end of life plans came up, and I asked if he wanted to be buried. He didn't want that. Nor did he want to be cremated.

My husband wants me to have his skull taken from his body and cleaned. Then he wants that skull put on the mantelpiece in the living room. The rest of his body he wants sent to one of those places that makes the gems out of bodies and made into two blue diamonds. He then wants those gems to be put in the eye socket of the skull to look like eyes. Then he can ""watch the family home"" and ""be passed down through the generations"".

My husband has always had a morbid/culturally insensitive sense of humour. As such, when he'd mentioned it before he was sick, I thought he was joking. Turns out, he is not joking. He even asked me to do it too so our skulls and matching eye gems can stay above the fireplace together. I adamantly refused.

I tried talking to him, but he's firm that this is what he wants. I told him that it made me uncomfortable, but he said it was also for our kids to have (who are not currently old enough to weigh in on this discussion). I asked if this was his way of trying to ""live on"" with the family even after death, and he said, ""not really, no"". I asked where he wanted the extra cremated remains from the gem company spread, and he told me that he didn't want any remains, and to just have the biggest gems possible made and have the company dispose of the rest.

I argued that he had no idea if his children would want the literal skull of their father. Further, which child would take the skull after I died? And in two or three generations, how would he feel if/when his descendants just sold this bizarre human skull at a garage sale because it means nothing to them? And finally, how was he going to feel about the fact that I, in my grief and trying to process the loss of him, would likely never take that skull out of the box, much less have to live with him ""staring"" at me every time I sat on the couch?

He essentially wasn't worried or didn't care about any of it. And regarding not taking it out of the box, it's the only time he seemed upset. He told me that was what he wanted, and I'd be ignoring his final wishes. I told him that he didn't have to live with those final wishes for years to come, but it didn't matter.

Part of me wants to get over my feelings, but I can't. I want to cry thinking of someone hacking apart my husband and handing me his bones, and I feel anxiety over the thought of putting that skull with his blue ""eyes"" in my home until I die. I'm fine if he wants a burial. I'm fine with cremation. Viking funeral, that weird thing where they turn you into tree food, whatever. I'm even fine with the gems on their own. But this whole skull thing is really bothering me. He won't budge, and he isn't joking.

At this point I'm thinking I would just do a simple cremation after he passes and spread his ashes on our property, but that seems sneaky and dishonest. But there is absolutely no way that I can comfortably live with what he's asking if he passes away before me. What do I do, Reddit?

TL;DR My husband wants his final resting place to be on our fireplace mantle in the form of his literal skull. This is to be complimented by two gems in the empty eye sockets made from his corpse. I'm deeply disturbed by this. Help?

Edit: I did not expect this to get the attention it has, and I am grateful for so many of the responses. At the end of the day, I want my husband to feel listened to, respected, and loved. This process has cemented to me that I definitely will not be putting his skull on my mantle until I die, but there were many compromises and ideas suggested that I'm going to think about. When it feels right, I'll suggest some of them to him. For now I'm going to sign off, give my husband a big hug, and think about this for a few days.

Edit 2: He knows this post exists now. We've had a good conversation. We've laughed a fair amount over the sheer ridiculousness of this hitting the front page and the comments it brought, and we both are confident we can reach a compromise that makes us both comfortable. We're not going to talk about it all today. We're just gonna get pizza, cuddle, and tell each other dumb jokes for the rest of the day. Goodnight Reddit. I'll update this at some point in the future."

They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it."

As it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. I'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (I only found  out because one of her friend's BF contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). I confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. I'll be totally honest in saying that I'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. I manned up, moved on and proposed (which I had planned on doing anyway). This is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to recent time. We are due married in November (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. Distant, not herself, away with the fairies. Even stopped having sex, which was very strange. I put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. Forward to Christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. I confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. I was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200B;

However, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. I arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. The vibe was bad guys, I could tell. We sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. At this rate I was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. Basically, a few of her friends had back in October (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. I'll be honest, the idea made me ill. I said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. Pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........I got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. I wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. We got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. I basically said that I needed some headspace, and that I'd spend the weekend at my mates. It was quick after that, and I left without a fuss. I'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. I am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. I suppose if anyone has been in a similar place I could do with some advice

I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**ORIGINAL** 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**UPDATE**

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

Its been a few days now since I've posted and reddit has given me some solid advice especially the kind redditors who messaged me directly. I'm very grateful for this cause it helped me calm down and not give in to my impulses. 

The morning after I posted, I texted Mike saying that I needed time and space to think about everything. He then replied with ""I've waited 10 years, I can wait a bit longer"". My heart melted. 

When the kids woke up, our son was looking for his dad. He's at the age now where he pretty much idolized his dad. I get why though, Mike is an amazing dad. Our daughter gave me the stink eye all morning. 

After lunch, when our son was in his room playing video games, my daughter confronted me about Mike. She basically said how she knew there was something going on (guess we're not that sneaky) and that she didn't want our fighting to affect their lives. She thought we were fighting. 

Now, the divorce affected her but not as badly as expected. We made sure to get her counseling immediately after and made extra sure her life was as normal as possible. I'm not gonna delude myself and think she wasn't hurt by it but I'm pretty confident in saying we dealt with it pretty well. Or as well as we could.

I then had the conversation about how we weren't fighting but quite the opposite... We were thinking about getting back together. She thought about it for a while and said she was happy for us and hoped it was forever this time. 

The next day I dropped my kids off at my parents house so I could talk to Mike at his place. We had a long talk about how we felt about each other, what we plan to do about it going forward, and as many of you suggested what he planned to do next time we hit a rough patch especially since we plan on having a 3rd kid. He told me that the night he cheated still haunted him 10 years later. He told me how it wasnt worth it one bit and how it was the biggest mistake of his life. He said that if ever we hit a rough patch again, we would talk about it like adults. He even suggested we do couples counseling every now and then even when times are good. I liked this idea. There are some details about our conversation that I want to keep private but long story short we got back together. We are going to take it slow and in every step we take, we both agreed that our children would take priority over everything. He's not going to move in yet but he would spend a few nights a week at home with us. 

Later that night, we sat the kids down and broke the news. Daughter didn't say much cause she already knew but our son was over the moon. Since we divorced when he was a baby, the concept of both his parents being together was quite new to him. They obviously asked questions and we answered them. We're also planning on doing family counseling to help make the transition easier for everybody. 

Overall, I'm really happy right now. Mike made a mistake 10 years ago but I don't hold it against him and have completely forgiven him for it. I know he loves me now and won't cheat on me anymore. I'm back together now with the love of my life and father of my kids and I couldn't be happier. 

As I type this out, Mike is in the next room playing video games with our son. I'm not entirely sure what the future will look like but I'm happy he's back. 

Thank you reddit for the advice. It really helped with our talk and how we proceed going forward. I think I'll stay online for an hour or so to reply till the kids are asleep and he comes to bed then it's my turn to have fun. 

Peace 😁"

A few hours ago I was lying in bed feeding our baby. My husband was begging me to come do something with him. I tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  He kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

I just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

I could see he was starting to lose his patience and I told him “Honey I have to take care of him before you, you know that”. And what he said back was really stunning. He looked me right in the eyes and said “if you love him so much, why don’t you suck his dick instead of mine”. I couldn’t say anything, I didn’t know what to say. And then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

I don’t even know what to make of this. What should I do? It just bothers me so deeply, it’s going to be hard for me to forgive. I really don’t have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. Am I just being sensitive? Maybe I’m just emotional, but I feel like crying."

Edit 2   10:27 mst: I have to get off for now. I will try to come back and update when I can. Again thank you all so much. 

I will try to keep this short. My family & my husband's family are members of a fundamentalist Christian denomination, of the type that views women's roles as exclusively to be a 'helpmeet' to their husband and to raise children. I don't think people realize how dark that world is really, but I won't get too much into it. Lets just say that unless you've been super brainwashed or actually somehow believe it, it's not a good place for women, or kids, or really anybody. 

I was homeschooled for my whole life and rarely had any interaction with anyone outside of the circle until I was 18. I wasn't allowed to talk to people who weren't from my church unless it was for the purpose of trying to convert them. 

From an early age I knew I was different and by puberty I was crushing on girls and having sexual thoughts and feelings about them. After reading my diary when I was 14 my parents sent me to conversion therapy, which was an awful experience and obviously didn't work. 

Between the ages of 15 and 18 I attempted suicide 11 times. After being released from the hospital the last time, my parents essentially farmed me out to family friends to help with their children and to attempt to find someone to court me. 

When I was there I had unmonitored internet access for the first time and joined an lgbt group locally under a pseudonym and started going out to meet people when I could since the supervision was more relaxed than it was with my parents. At one of these meetups I met a girl who I fell completely in love with and started dating her in secret. This was in April of 2017. 

Fast forward to when we had been dating around 8 months. It was around this time of year and we went out to a Christmas light festival in a neighboring town. Usually people from our denomination don't go to that kind of thing because it's not god honoring but friends of the people I was staying with saw me there with her and told them. By the time I got home that night my parents were there waiting for me. 

Two months later, after being forced back home and having everything taken away, I was introduced to my now husband, and by may of this year we were married. 

I don't love him. He doesn't love me. He 100% buys into everything that the religion teaches but had a failed courtship and then did mission work. He's literally told me that the only reason we are married is because he feels like Jesus's mission for him in life is to ""heal"" me. 

It's been 8 months of absolute hell. Everything I do is approved by him, I only have friends who are the wives of his friends or are from church. I don't have a job. I literally keep a box that I told him was a hope chest and put enough baby things in that he doesn't know I have a tablet and books that I'm not supposed to have. 

I know that this isn't really the typical kind of thing that gets posted in this board, but I'm desperate. I've been talking to my girlfriend again since I got the tablet. I've been trying to mend things with her. I know that I need to get out of this situation but I have no idea how to. I'm afraid I'm going to get dragged back into this hole again and I can't. I am hoping that this board might have people on it, even just one or two, that can help me to leave safely and permanently. It's hard because if I do go I have to basically build my life over again from scratch and I don't have any family or anyone who would help or support me in any way."

This all actually happened a few days after my original post, but things have been pretty hectic since then, but I wanted to write a quick update since I got some useful advice in the first thread. The best advice was to insist on seeing the chat one last time to see if she had written anything about me. She initially said no, because it also has private information about her friends, etc, etc. But I basically said if she doesn't let me see the texts it's over and she reluctantly agreed, but told me to keep in mind that this was a year ago and how much we grew as a couple since then blablabla. 

I scrolled to the period when we started dating and yea sure enough there I was in the texts. It actually made me feel really weird reading other people talking about me. Right around the time we first slept together someone asked her if I was better than some guy (apparently a former FWB of hers). Without missing a beat she fires back no, that it was kinda disappointing because I was nervous and had some performance anxiety and then actually went into detail about what we did. She knew I was feeling anxious since I hadn't been with anyone in a while after a bad breakup and she was supporting in person, so it felt extra shitty that behind my back she was complaining about me. A friend of hers even mocked me and she said nothing. 

Katie saw the look on my face and tried to tell me again that we grew so much and things became really good when we got comfortable with each other and connected. She even showed me a text where she said that to her friends. But honestly at that point I was already done. I asked her to move out and after a bit of drama and nasty words, she moved her stuff to her mother's place. 

As others said, I have no doubt they are not talking shit about me together, but honestly I could not care less what those pieces of shit are chattering about, I just never want to see any of them ever again."

[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

I've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. I've also read through a lot of the comments. Thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. There's been A LOT of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. It's whatever at this point.

We had been texting off and on all evening. As promised, I agreed not to bring it up in person. When I got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. I was a little nervous not knowing what I might be walking into, but overall I just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. When I walked in it was clear so did she. Her sister was helping her pack up her things. I didn't know what to say, but I never expected this. I honestly thought everything was going to be okay when I got home. Her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

I walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. She didn't say anything either. She didn't even look at me. If she was going to leave I at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. Everything I had read in the comments about buying a bidet and OCD lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than I had considered. I started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""YOU PUT THIS ONLINE? I TOLD YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT!"" Her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. She then accused me of cheating. WHAT? This whole thing has been crazy and I feel like I had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. I snapped.

I told her sister I had never cheated. Not once. I would never cheat on her. Enough was enough, so I told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier I had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. Everything went silent. Like, no one said a word. Out of nowhere they both start crying. Her sister stared yelling at me and told me I shouldn't be talking about things I don't understand. When I asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that I need to mind my own business.

1. Her sister knows about it. (She did not know I posted on Reddit about it)
2. Her sister thinks it's normal.
3. I need to mind my own business? They're MY SOCKS!

I stood there all kinds of messed up so I just left. I went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. I also called off work today. I went home and all her stuff is gone. I didn't text her back. I think I'm done.

To clarify a few things: She insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. She told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. She reaffirmed it's not a fetish. She won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. I can't keep up with the comments. I'm pooped. (I'm trying to find humor in this because I'm really upset :(

So yeah.

Edit: (a sentence) Her sister did not previously know I posted about it on Reddit. I'm sure they both do now. "

And I already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there’s no way I want to go through it again so soon. I’m also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it’s still in the womb. I don’t want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won’t be mine. I gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me “it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me”. She told me all she wants is another baby and that I shouldn’t deprive her of it when I can help her so easily. I tried to reason with her but she literally told me “if you don’t do this to me then I don’t want a relationship with you anymore”. I asked her if she was serious and she told me “yes” and left. I don’t know what to do. My mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. I’m not sure how I should handle this. I think she’s acting crazy."

I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks travelling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It’s really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn’t accept it because she didn’t want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn’t matter that the proposal wasn’t exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn’t throw it back because of where it came from. So she can’t possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she’s willing to reject it because she didn’t like the place I asked. 

I’m preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she’ll say yes, but I’m done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.

--Update to the story.
Hi and thanks for all the comments and help.

I ended up following the advice of one of the commenters. The conversation with my girlfriend went something like this:
Me: No that was my proposal. You rejected it. It's never going to happen again.
GF: So we aren't getting married? You aren't going to propose... ever?
Me: No never. I'm glad you were the one I proposed to and I'm happy that I found the courage to take that step and make such a huge commitment. But no. It was a one-time thing. If you want to marry me, you'll have to propose.

I decided to see how things went and planned to give her till my birthday (July) to make her proposal or I would end it and move on. She did while we were hiking a trail back home. I accepted.

That's it for now. Am I making a huge mistake? Maybe. I'll get a prenup of course and protect my assets. If it ends it won't cost me more than a few hundred. Hopefully, I get many happy years from this. If not, I'll update the post.

Also, thanks for all the comments and support. Weird how much that meant. I also genuinely appreciated the people that objected to me ending things. It's the internet so I expect to hear nothing but ""Dump her"". Getting another more reasonable side to things was helpful.

gtg22x,My boyfriend (27M) has been treating me (23F) differently since he got his ancestry DNA results back...,20684,0.94,2769,2020-05-30 21:04:24,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gtg22x/my_boyfriend_27m_has_been_treating_me_23f/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gtg22x/my_boyfriend_27m_has_been_treating_me_23f/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"A few weeks ago, my (23F) boyfriend (27M) got his results back from one of those ancestry tests. He's never been interested in his family history before but one of his friends bought him the kit for his birthday.

A few days after seeing his results (which were nothing special, about 95 percent European and mostly just from England, where we live) he really excitedly told me that he'd been messaged by a group of people about a shared relative. Apparently all of them have an ancestor in common (my boyfriend's great (x 10) grandfather that can be linked to royal lineage.

I was pleased and a bit amused that my boyfriend was so happy, especially since he seemed to be telling every single person he knows and he posted on facebook about it. However since then I've noticed some uncomfortable behaviours from him that is making me second guess our relationship.

1. He quit his job two weeks ago (accountant) which was very unexpected and something we hadn't discussed before now. He gets defensive when I try to bring it up and ask if there was something in particular that triggered it. He has only said that he doesn't believe the 9-5 life is right for him.
2. He has suddenly started insisted on using condoms when we have sex. We have been together three years and my birth control (the copper coil) has never been an issue for him before. My boyfriend has started saying it is not good enough as a form of contraceptive by itself, which would be fine, except he has started making a few comments alongside this about how I'm trying to 'steal his genes' and implying that I want his bloodline.
3. He won't kiss me in public anymore or touch me at all around his family, which he has explained by saying he doesn't like PDA anymore and it's embarrassing. He is fine touching me when we're alone however.
4. He has asked me to look into my family history by making a family tree to  go alongside his. It's not something I care about or want to pursue (my family are also immigrants so I imagine harder to track than his) but since I refused he has made jokes that I must be scared to find out that my family 'don't match up' to his. As a sidenote, by traditional standards my family are a lot better off and more 'middle class' than his although this has never affected our relationship.

We've generally had a really good relationship before now and there have never been any major communication issues or anything like that. I'm really confused as to what's going through his mind right now and I could use some advice. Thank you.

TL;DR: my boyfriend's behaviour towards me has gotten a lot worse since he discovered he has connections to royalty in his family tree"

I am a Lt in the military and I work as a pilot.

A few months ago both my wife of three years and our child died while she was giving birth. Everyone tells me how sorry they are, how amazing of a woman she was, how much of a great father I would’ve have been. I don’t like hearing it, I don’t want to know what I could have been, should have been, or would have been because it doesn’t exist anymore.

My brother is getting married later this summer and everyone is preparing for that. I’m really happy for them and both families. Plus it slowly took everyone’s focus off me and they can focus on the happier future. I was obviously going to be a groomsmen for him, was going to give a speech after the best man, and just tease him in front of his new wife and family. My wife was looking forward to it and so was everyone else. People say they like my speeches and toasts, and my wife used to joke that every time I talk the room gets quiet so everyone can hear what I say.

I just don’t think I’m mentally prepared to go to my brother’s wedding. I don’t think I’ll be ready in a few months either. I already texted him it’s hard for me to meet up with the groomsmen once a month when they go out to dinner and plan stuff out. Thankfully he understands due to my job but the reality is I just don’t want to be around it. It’s not out of hate or angry or sorrow, I just really want to be alone and focus on work. It’s the only thing that keeps me going. That rush I feel when I take off at full speed and push the throttle harder once I’m soaring. Twisting the stick and pushing my body to feel that high. It’s the drive and push keeping me going and takes my mind off my miserable life.

I’ve been thinking of asking my commander for a TDY or if I could deploy with another squadron during the summer. Just hoping I can give a valid excuse why I can’t go to the wedding. I promise I’ll pay my brother his wedding respects before and after the wedding, I’ll even go over to his place once he’s married and spoil them with gifts.

I know it’s a horrible thing to not want to go to my little brother’s wedding but I honestly can’t do it. Every day I wish something would just happen to me during a flight exercise or while I’m driving to work or even some accident at work. My brother deserves a better brother who won’t abandon his wedding and I’m sorry I can’t be that stronger older brother.

Would it really be that bad if I skipped out on his wedding?"

Thank you guys for all of your advice and comments, many saying you’ve been in mine or Adam’s position, it’s made me feel better. I’m gonna go ahead and just post an update, because I don’t think there will be more of an outcome than this. 

I ended up having a phone call with Adam, mostly because I wanted to know about the pictures she’s sent. Turns out she’s sent pics of me in my underwear, and nudes that aren’t actually of me. Or her. So we’re assuming she got those from google. He feels really bad and is actually having a hard time with all of this. I assured him I don’t blame him at all for the underwear pics, or anything like that. He ended up telling me that they actually *have* FaceTimed, but she would never show her face, only the top of her head/hair which is dyed a similar color to mine (never thought anything of this, now I think it might be really weird) and her excuse was she felt like she looked bad on video, was self conscious, didn’t have makeup on, etc. He said he didn’t think it was weird. Idk. He also told me he’s tried a ton of times to arrange visits to meet and she’s came up with excuses every time. Said that he’s been mostly content to talk through text/over the phone up until this point. Also said he’s going to try to reach out to her one more time to talk about everything but that he’s moving on. 

As for me, I’m not sure I can break my lease yet but I’m going to go ahead and move out and in with a friend until my lease is over. We briefly talked when I went to my apartment, and she sort of half apologized but is still pretty hostile and defensive. So I’m going to give her space. I feel bad for her, but I don’t think our friendship is going to survive this whole thing. Anyway, this has been some crazy shit, and I appreciate all of the responses I got. Y’all are awesome. 



Man... I don’t know where to go from here so I thought I’d go to reddit. 

My best friend, we’ll call her Maggie, and I met our freshman year of college. We are now roommates and moved in together two years ago. 

In 2015, my best friend spent spring break a couple states away, and matched with a guy on tinder. When she came back to campus she immediately told me about him and how amazing he was and how they only went out to dinner once (edit: *this was obviously a lie*) but that they were talking 24/7. I got super excited and asked to see a pic. That was the only picture of him she’s ever shown me.

Over the past five years he’s literally been her whole world. She talks about him constantly. She always has her nose in her phone. She gets clingy when he takes too long to text back, she’s cried to me a few times because she’s lurked on his social media and seen he was around other girls (my roommate doesn’t have social media herself). I had asked a few times why they have never met up again and she said they’re both too busy and don’t have the money for the trip. I even told her that he could stay with us and that would save some money. He’s sent presents and even flowers on Valentine’s Day every year. They’ve basically been dating this whole time. 

So yesterday my roommate picked up a shift at work and was gone. I get a knock on our door and I open it to a guy. He says hi, and I give a confused hi? And then he barges in and scoops me up into a hug. He starts saying “I thought you were working? I was hoping your roommate was here so I could surprise you when you got back” And I am so confused. I immediately get down and back away and let him know I have absolutely no clue what he’s talking about. My brain can’t even process what’s happening. 

Then *he* looks confused, and says, “Maggie?” And I’m like no.... that’s my roommate? My roommate and I look nothing alike so I’m even more confused. Then something kind of clicks and I think oh my god is this the guy she’s been dating? So I say wait, are you Adam? And he gives me a very slow yesssss, and I get excited and say “oh my god I bet Maggie is going to flip out! I can’t believe you’re here.” 

His demeanor completely changes. He asks me what I’m talking about. I’m Maggie? And I tell him no, I’m Summer. Maggie’s roommate. At this point I’m still completely missing something he has just pieced together. He just says “holy fuck” and looks like he doesn’t know what to say. Eventually he asks if he can sit down. I invite him in. He then proceeds to tell me for the past five years, he’s thought he’s been talking to *me*. Every picture he’s ever seen of Maggie has actually been pictures of me. I’m completely dumbfounded and we don’t know what to say to each other at first. So he gets out his phone and shows me proof. He has tons of pictures of me saved on his phone, and went to their messages and showed me proof that she’s been sending them to him. I felt and still feel completely sick to my stomach. I get out my phone and show him real pictures of her. I tell him maybe they could just talk when she gets off of work? And he’s really pissed at this point. I say maybe we should call her first and let her know he’s here. 

So I do that and she starts flipping out. Saying she’s not coming home. Tells him to leave and that she won’t talk to him. He calls her and starts yelling at her over the phone. After everyone calms she eventually comes home. He’s hurt and accusing, she’s crying, I’m sitting there awkwardly. She tells him that she’s still the same person he’s had feelings for and he screams at her, “no, I thought I was in love with your roommate!” And that completely makes her break down so I tell him maybe he should leave for the night and everyone should have their own space. He agrees and after he leaves she goes completely psychotic on me and starts throwing shit around the living room. Tells me she hates me, I start crying, it’s a mess. 

I left to stay with a friend and haven’t been back so I don’t know what’s gone down. I feel like I have no idea who the person I’m living with is and I feel weirdly violated. Do I move out? Do I try to call her? She hasn’t even texted me. I don’t know how to deal with this situation"
iweaes,My (27M) fiancée (24F) has 'accidentally' lost/broken three engagement rings now... I'm starting to suspect she's doing it on purpose,20583,0.96,2578,2020-09-20 19:26:53,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iweaes/my_27m_fiancée_24f_has_accidentally_lostbroken/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iweaes/my_27m_fiancée_24f_has_accidentally_lostbroken/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I've (27M) been with my fiancée/girlfriend (24F) for three years now. I proposed a year ago, but it definitely wasn't out of the blue - she'd been not-so-subtly hinting at getting engaged for months at that point. Although we're both somewhat hot-headed, we generally have a good relationship and we occasionally only fight about small, normal things.

I know NOTHING about jewellery, but I spent a lot of time looking for the right ring to propose with. I talked to two of her closest friends to get their input, and in the end I spent around $4000 on the ring. When my fiancée saw it, she told me she loved it and I'm pretty sure she was telling the truth.

This January, my fiancée called me up in tears. She'd somehow lost the ring on her way home from work and she had no clue where it might be. I left work early to come help her search, but since she'd been riding the subway, the ring was long gone.

My fiancée was clearly distraught, so a few weeks later I dipped into my savings and bought her a different ring. It wasn't quite as expensive as the last, but it was from the same jeweller and still a good make. 

Around June, I noticed one day that it had been a while since I saw my fiancée actually wear her engagement ring. She went pale and confessed to me that she thought she'd taken it off before bed one night and now it was lost somewhere in our flat. This time we searched for days and I dug up half the floorboards looking for it, but the ring is (to this day) missing.

At this point, buying another ring was out of the question (too expensive) so I asked her if she'd rather either a) have a cheap replacement ring (under $50) until after we're married, or b) go without a ring for now. She chose option b. 

One day we were visiting my grandmother, who asked my fiancée where her ring was. When we told her it was lost, my grandmother was kind enough to give my fiancée one of her rings instead. 

My fiancée seemed delighted and everything was working out perfectly until this week. I came home to find my grandmother's ring on the table, looking almost unrecognisable. My fiancée cried and told me that she'd managed to step on the ring that morning hard enough to break it.

I took the ring to a jewellery repair service right away. Sadly they told me that since a few small stones are missing and the original fitting is warped, the ring will never really be the same. They also told me that they were certain someone stepping on the ring couldn't realistically cause this amount of damage.

When I got home, I brought this up to my fiancée and asked her if she was 100% sure she'd only stepped on the ring. She completely flipped and yelled at me asking if I was calling her a liar. I mentioned what the jewellery store said, and she started screaming about me only caring about money and the 'cost' of the rings. It's been two days and we've barely spoken, especially as she's only coming out of our bedroom for meals. 

TL;DR: my fiancée has lost two of her engagement rings and now she's broken a third. When I tried to talk with her about it, she exploded. Any advice on how to handle this?"

Summary so far: Because of some medical information disclosed to me by him, I believed my new boyfriend was post-op transgender, ftm. You wonderful folks encouraged me to continue being supportive and open, and to let him come out to me at his own leisure.

Shortly after my original post, I sent him a text letting him know I was really into him and, short of rape, murder, or animal abuse, there wasn’t much he could tell me that would scare me away.

In person, our conversations were wonderful and deep and funny and flirty and fun. Then he’d go days and days without texting, calling, or anything.

I wrote this off as him being busy (he’s a first responder with a crazy schedule) and mostly just let it go. But something felt off.

I told him if he wasn’t interested anymore that was fine, and he could just tell me. Honestly, I can handle rejection pretty well. He got very defensive and asked where I’d get that idea. 

After a particularly bad storm blew through our area, I texted him to check in, make sure he and his family were okay, etc. I got a series of one word responses, and asked if everything was okay, or if I’d done something to upset him. He said no, he just had a lot on his mind. 

I told him that was fine, and that I understood, and that my anxiety was getting the best of me. I again said that if he needed to vent or talk or be distracted I was there for him. I also told him, though, that I just needed to know he was still interested in seeing me. 

I got no response. For hours. 

So I told him that was fine, and that I wished him the best, and that if he ever felt like he wanted to try again to hit me up. He sent me “Ok.” It really tore me up. I felt so close to him, and in person everything was so good. 

Flash forward a few days and I was talking to a friend about the situation. Turns out she knows him. When I mentioned his name, she interjected “GOD, NO!” much to my confusion. 

I’m at least the 3rd woman he’s done this with. Gets really close, really fast then basically drops off. So no clue what his issue is, but I’m sorry he doesn’t feel like he can trust me (or anyone else). That said, I can’t spend my life waiting for him to be ready. 

Oh well, easy come, easy go."

My fiancée, “Nancy”, and I are getting married in December. We’ve been going through a small rough patch since late June, I felt like everything was okay, but we were just out of sync. We’ve been together for 2 years, and this has happened before and we just come out of it usually.

I have a very good relationship with my fiancées twin sister, “Peggy”. We hung out a lot before she introduced me to her sister, so I’ve known her longer and she’s one of my best friends and is probably the person that knows me the best other than my family and Nancy. She and her sister also have a great relationship. No resentment, no anger towards each other just sisterly love.

Saturday I received a string of messages from Peggy that were telling me to not marry Nancy. She told me she didn’t love me like she should and if we got married we’d be in a loveless sexless marriage. I told her I didn’t believe her. She sent me screenshots of messages between her and Nancy. I wish I hadn’t read them. She said that I wasn’t the love of her life, that I wasn’t her soulmate, that’s I was just a good option and would be the a good provider and great dad to her kids, that I was “nice guy that’d any girl would be lucky to have, but he’s not the one for me.”

I asked Peggy why she told me all of this and she said she’s my best friend and she loves me. She said she’s wanted me forever, but couldn’t come between me and her sister like that. She said she’d love me like a wife should, that she fantasizes about being with me intimately, and that I drive her crazy. She asked me to leave Nancy and come be with her.

I’m so confused. I don’t know what to do about anything. I feel like my life had been turned completely upside down. I don’t know where to go from here."
bb6tv5,"My (36m) wife (33f) was sued, I'm feeling resentment towards her and I don't know how to move past it.",20242,0.94,447,2019-04-09 17:04:25,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb6tv5/my_36m_wife_33f_was_sued_im_feeling_resentment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb6tv5/my_36m_wife_33f_was_sued_im_feeling_resentment/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"FWIW This is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. No offense to reddit, but I’d rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but I’m okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

As the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. The money is a significant amount for us, we didn’t have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

My currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger I’m feeling towards my wife. Until now I’ve always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. But, since I’m the breadwinner I can’t help but to feel like I’m spending ""my"" money on something that isn’t my fault. I’ve had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. However, I have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where I know my wife is guilty. She has a part time job and doesn’t make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

What did my wife do? (Note: I had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

She used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of ‘recruiter’. My wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""Laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. Laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but Laura gave her a personal email address instead. My wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as Laura at her company. These messages said derogatory things about Laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make Laura look bad. Her manager got one of these messages that claimed that Laura was a heavy drug user. Laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass Laura. Well, Laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. Not only that, but Laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. My wife didn’t know this at this point, but Laura was pregnant. Several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on Laura behalf. 


Using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms Laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. She did some more internet sleuthing and found Laura's husband on facebook. Laura's husband didn’t have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. My wife sent him an email claiming that Laura was cheating on him. The husband confronted Laura about this email and Laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  My wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that Laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. What she didn’t realize was Laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. Some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. She also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. Laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


My wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. One of Laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. My wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) She did not make herself known immediately. Instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. She was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about Laura - my wife was telling people that Laura didn’t actually know who the father was, among other things. This was at an event where her husband was at as well. The word got back around to Laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


I’m leaving a fair amount of information out - My wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in Laura circle and sent them messages about Laura on multiple occasions. All the messages were trying to paint Laura in an extremely derogatory light. All the events I’ve mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  My wife didn’t think to mask her IP address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same IP address, ours. Many of Laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, Laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


Laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. They had ample evidence against her. All the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. She even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife’s accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


I honestly felt awful for Laura, there were lots of tears on her end. You could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. She said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. She was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. And that my wife’s harassment continued even after Laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


My wife has never done anything this crazy before. I knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. We’ve had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. But, she really fucked up this time. I don’t know how to move forward. I know someone is going to suggest therapy, but I really want to start building up an emergency fund again. We’re pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** Wife was sued by her former best friend, I emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. I need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. Funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. What can we do to move forward?"

He was my best friend until I went to middle school when we started to drift apart. He was always a shy, quiet kid but I have no idea where it went wrong. I think it was when he was about 13 when he started to lose his cheerfulness, started to smile less and adopted his brooding demeanor. He openly asked me how he could get a girlfriend and how he could become more popular at school since he was 10 or 11, but I think as he started to go down a negative spiral he began talking about how he got the ""ugly genes"" out of the two of us, about how girls at school don't ""respect"" him enough even though he treats them like a ""gentleman"" would, about how he feels like an ""incel"" all the time. I'm genuinely worried about him. I went through a phase during middle school/high school when I used to hang out with the wrong sort of kids and I regret not being there for my brother and neglecting him when he needed me. I want to reconnect with him but I'm afraid that my brother who I thought I knew is gone for good. He made two friends at school before covid started, and at first I was happy to see he was starting to return to his cheerful self again, but recently he's just been acting more strangely. He never comes out of his room anymore and I thought he was talking to himself in there until I realized he was having phone calls. About deranged thoughts of how society works and all that. Then he went into a rant about how he wants to rape a girl at his school and fantasizes about *keeping her in our basement.* What the fuck do I do at this point? I try to talk to my parents about him but all they say is that he's a lost cause and that they're going to kick him out when he turns 18. I can't help but feel like if I was there for him he would've turned out better."

We’ve been in a relationship for four years and live together. For both of us it’s the first serious relationship and although it hasn’t always been easy, we’ve never had any significant problems. We are on the same page on most topics (racism, politics, finances etc) or so I thought at least.

Fast forward to a few days ago. We were watching *12 Years A Slave* and I made some comments about how horrible slavery was. That’s when he dropped the bomb that I actually shouldn’t criticise slavery at all since I look white enough that I would’ve benefited from the system. (Honestly it felt like he wanted to say that for a long time). I asked him wtf he meant by that and he said me complaining about racism belittles the experience of black people. 

I told him that I wouldn’t have benefitted from slavery at all since I’m literally 50% black despite my looks. He said that even if I didn’t directly benefit, I would’ve lived a “comfortable” life in that era. I asked how and he said slaveowners kept mixed women as mistresses so I would’ve spent most of my time being treated well and “popping out white babies”. He made it sound like it was a complete luxury. At this point I was so appalled that I called him an ignorant idiot and we started arguing. 

He said that I’m just an “exotic looking white girl” who’s trying to feel oppressed and that I’m just as privileged as him. I told him that he really has no idea what he’s talking about and then he started ignoring me. We haven’t spoken for a few days (although he tried to initiate sex a few times and seems to be warming up to me again) and I really don’t know what to do. He’s never said something so ridiculous. I’m just so angry at his stupid comments and immaturity."
gqsqd8,I don't want to take part in my GF's (23F) sex ritual on our wedding night... but I still want to marry her,20188,0.95,3599,2020-05-26 13:22:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gqsqd8/i_dont_want_to_take_part_in_my_gfs_23f_sex_ritual/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gqsqd8/i_dont_want_to_take_part_in_my_gfs_23f_sex_ritual/,self.relationship_advice,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"My post was capped because I didn't have a throwaway account but I'd like some advice:

So I'm (23M) getting married to my GF (23F) early next year if all goes to plan. I don't have a lot of family (I'm no contact with my dad for several years now.) She, however, has a huge extended family.

For the most part we get on great. They tend to be very loud and have huge personalities, which is sometimes hard for me to deal with since I've always been on the quiet side. But overall very warm and caring people.

Something weird I've noticed since we got engaged is that my GF's cousins sometimes make jokes about our wedding night. It's weird for them to joke about it since I'm pretty sure her family is aware we've slept together before since we share a bed at holiday gatherings and vacations.

A few nights ago we were discussing wedding plans and thinking about places to go on our honeymoon (if COVID-19 clears up and we can travel by then). My GF and I were brainstorming ideas when she tells me that we won't need a bridal suite right away. Obviously I ask why (we're getting married at a pretty nice hotel) and she says that she'd like for us to stay at her parent's house.

I don't really mind this - we're trying to save money for a house deposit anyway - but GF seems like she has more to say so I push for why she wants it. She tells me that there's a really old tradition in her family on the wedding night.

The husband and wife go into the master bedroom together and they are supposed to 'consummate' the marriage. The rest of the family are waiting outside the door so they can applaud them and cheer when they come out. Then a piece of the bed sheet is cut off and sewn into a big tapestry my GF's mother owns.

I think my GF saw I wasn't happy because she quickly told me that we wouldn't have to actually consummate the marriage if I felt uncomfortable and we could just pretend.

I don't want anything to do with this. I absolutely freaked and told her under no circumstances will I be doing that kind of thing in front of her whole family. When I came back from taking a walk to clear my head, she was now noticeably acting down and still is. I think she's also been texting her family about this because I received a text from her mother telling me that I 'don't understand the importance of family' and tradition yet and this kind of tradition has been around longer than I've been alive.

I don't know how I'm meant to go on from here. I really love my GF and she is the woman I want to spend my life with. I'm freaked out of course but she is my whole world. But how should I handle her family and navigate his 'tradition'?

TL;DR my girlfriend's family have a tradition where they stand outside the room on the wedding night. I still want to marry my GF but I don't want anything to do with this. Advice?"

cxr0sp,"My childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while I was sleeping. She told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. Except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place.

Throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

So, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, Sarah [31F], my long-time partner, John [34M], and myself [29F].

I've known that Sarah has had a crush on John for a long time. It's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, Sarah has never crossed any boundaries. But because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(My boyfriend and I had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

Apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

Which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while I'm sleeping. She took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. She apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

I found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

Now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad I'm being abused.

But here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. He took the photos and videos *for me*. The day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so I can watch them because it's better than porn. 

But nobody believes me. They're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. I don't know what to do. I'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

How do I fix my friendships and convince everybody that **I'M** the one who wanted it? 

There is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but I do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. I'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

Please help. I'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

Edit: since this needs to be said, YES, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. It's a four digit code.

Edit edit: 

- yes, I *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- I have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. Just *mostly* everybody. I was upset and generalizing last night.

- I am in the US.

- my boyfriend **DOES HAVE A PASSCODE** on his phone. Seriously. Stop blaming him. This is *definitely* not his fault.

Edit AGAIN since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and I: we attended a BBQ where EVERYBODY left their phones inside. We *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

You guys are being a little mean about this.

**Edit** (again): 

Went to the police and will update when I can.

## MINOR UPDATE 

I went to the police last night, alone. After everything that was said, I was nervous about having John with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

Really. Y'all made me nervous.

I went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

At first, the officer at the window was like, ""I think that's a crime? Maybe? I've gotta call my supervisor.""

That happened twice before the police were like, Okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. We're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

I gave my report and left. About fifteen minutes later, I got a phone call from the local PD. They told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

My comments being that Sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue John and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

They suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. Well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, I'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

So, that's about it. 

A bunch of hemming and hawing and I don't knows. They'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

I'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today."
a03zh9,My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.,20091,0.95,4479,2018-11-25 06:10:56,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a03zh9/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_found_an_engagement_ring_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a03zh9/my_26m_girlfriend_24f_found_an_engagement_ring_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her. 

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than Grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be."

I posted on my cities subreddit that I was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

I got about 50 messages all together. One guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. I love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. I gave him my number and we texted all night. Our first phone call was over an hour.

He told me he was also lonely. I mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. He offered to cuddle me. We decided to have a cuddle date

We met up the following week. He picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. We got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

That's how we met. I know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. People have asked how we met and I've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  I don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?"

All the comments on my previous post showed me that I am way too young, dumb and ignorant with what I signed up with. I started researching actual lived experiences and I read so many horror stories that I've decided to not go ahead with being involved in any way, shape or form with helping them have kids. 

In fact, I'm not even sure if I want to ever get pregnant after all the stories about 3rd and 4th degree tears, poop, miscarriages. I am clearly not in the right stage of life/maturity to even consider doing something of this magnitude.

The difficult part was mustering up the courage to call my sister to tell her my decision. I really look up to my sister and love her lots, and our family and religion has always been about helping others out where we can. 

When I called her to tell her, we had a short convo at first where I basically said ""sorry, can't do it but that doesn't mean I love you any less"". She seemed sad but said she was happy to respect my decision and I thought that was it.

Then just last night, sister & BIL called me back over zoom. My sister was crying and begged me to reconsider, as both of them really wanted biological kids. BIL told me that they were really disappointed in me and hoped that I would find it within me to do this. When I told them my concerns, my BIL just said pregnancy & motherhood is a beautiful and natural process and that I was made for this. 

I'm SO glad I did this over video call instead of in person, because I just hung up on them and faked having connection problems. I've been ignoring their texts so far and frankly I don't know what else to say. 

But any way, thank you all from the bottom of my heart for opening my eyes :)

A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here."

The morning when she got home, her phone received a notification when she was sleeping. The messages were from an old college crush. Apparently she has been meeting him for sex instead of visiting her sister. This has been going on for over a year. She has met at his place, and our place. They were also emotionally involved. She asked him for more sex than she did with me our entire marriage. She managed to meet with him, whenever I was away at work, or with my friends. I confronted her, and she tried to lie about everything. I backed her in a corner with evidence, and she eventually came clean. She cried, and  tried apologizing serveral times, but I left the house. I had small suspicions over the years, but thought I was just being paranoid.

 We haven't had sex since we've been married, and have been through counseling. Everything was great in our relationship otherwise. There was nothing wrong with her sex drive, she just enjoyed sex with other guy, and coming home to  paid bills. I am so depressed and angry. I did everything I could to be a great husband. I didn't deserve any of this. This will most likely cause trust issues in my future relationships.

This is a doozy. I've been trying to post it since it happened but just haven't really been able to process it. 

So I'm 23M, and I'm the oldest of five siblings, the others are 16M, 14F, 10F and 10M. Our mother is severely bipolar but very resistant to treatment and, to be frank, is an absolutely shit mother. I've done my best my whole life to raise my siblings since she clearly isn't going to, and I like to think I've done quite well. I managed to keep them out of the Care system most of the time, at least. 

Two years ago, I finally moved out of my mum's house and started university. I stayed in the same town incase the kids needed me, but I decided I had to start putting myself first a little bit and I couldn't keep putting off my own life because my mum is a failure as a parent, you know? With the exception of a few minor incidents, it's actually gone rather a lot more smoothly than I thought thus far. I currently have a house with two other students from my uni, though one is currently back in her hometown for the lockdown. 

So, the problem. Yesterday, there was a knock on the door around noonish. I wasn't expecting anyone but figured maybe it was the postman or my flatmate had ordered out for his lunch or whatever and opened it. To my shock, all four siblings are stood on the doorstep looking about as confused as I felt. 16yo informed me that Mum had dropped them off here without saying why or where she was going, and she was in the middle of a pretty intense manic episode and was just sort of rambling nonsenically instead of answering any questions. Of course I wasn't going to abandon the kids  so I let them in and have been trying desperately to get hold of mum ever since. I know she's getting my texts because I've been sending them on WhatsApp and it's showing me she's reading them. Also, when I call, it's ringing two or three times and then cutting out so she's clearly seeing the calls coming in and rejecting them, rather than it ringing out. I've tried reaching out to her friends with very similar results. 

I don't know what to do. I don't have the space for 4 kids in the house and it's *so* unfair to my housemate (though bless his soul he's an absolute angel of a guy and keeps telling me not to worry and he's fine with it). I currently have the girls staying in other housemates vacant room (with her permission) and the boys are in my room with me. Obviously not ideal. I also frankly can't afford to take care of 4 kids all by myself. No idea what groceries are gonna look like from here on out. The kids haven't brought many belongings with them, so they don't have many clean clothes. 16M and probably 14F can get away with wearing my clothes if it comes to it, but I have no idea how I'm gonna clothe the twins if they're here for more than a few days.

We went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. I was the DD because I don't really drink. Anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. I made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. I then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. As I was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. She thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when I was ready. When I finally got to bed I could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. Then it got quiet and then it started.

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date. 

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

TL;DR: I moved out and started dating a new girl. "

I wanted to say thank you all you guys gave me a push to try something that I was on the fence about. For the first time in a long time I feel happy and content. I managed to sort my feelings out and realized that this is what I want.

We went on a few dates, and it went well, nothing huge since we are both leery of COVID. But I was able to present myself as her girlfriend, to her circle of friends and I had no issues with that. Most of her friends were very supportive.

Last night I pretty much told Laura everything I had said in my reddit post, and she fully accepted what I said, and seemed happy. I am also really glad I told her because apparently after the cottage she felt that I was not interested in her as anything more then a friend, and was going to move on emotionally.

She also has given me a drawer, a copy of her house keys, and a toothbrush and has told me I can stay there whenever I want, and if I really wanted to I could just move in since we have basically been living together almost since COVID started.

I will be honest I also realized that I don't know a whole lot about Laura, and she was completely comfortable telling me anything and everything. Which made me feel very comfortable.

We also talked about work, and she said she is going to transfer to a different team, just to avoid any complications from that.

I also told my parents about what is happening, and my mom was okay with it, however my dad was extremely supportive, and told me it didn't matter I am his daughter and that is all that matters.

The only thing still bothering me revolves around intimatcy/sex, which are things I don't know about. I told Laura about my confusion around that and she has assured me not to worry and when the time comes it will be fine.

I am probably rushing into stuff too much, but I feel happy for the first time. So thank you for helping me reddit.

TL;DR; I am finally able to find happiness, and it is working out. So thank you reddit

I need to sleep, but i will answer what i can tomorrow thank you for all the positive comments, it feels great. "

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

efnn56,[Update] I [M 32] ruined Christmas and I have no regrets.,19631,0.93,557,2019-12-26 05:11:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/efnn56/update_i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/efnn56/update_i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I wanted to update the kind people who took the time to give me advice and affirmation last Christmas when I really needed it. I wanted to provide an update how Christmas and the year went.

**ORIGINAL:**  ([Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9jdy7/i_m_32_ruined_christmas_and_i_have_no_regrets/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf%EF%BF%BC)) Long story short.. I’m half-Korean and half-white. My white family has always been rude to my mom and treats her as an outsider. Every year my mom brings gifts for everyone and gets nothing in return. She never causes drama but gets treated like crap and I think it’s because of their own biases. My white grandma is 80 and the last grandparent alive. She is the only reason we get together with them. After 32 years I finally blew up on a rude family member (my aunt) who disrespected my mom... with a few expletives. I blew up in front of the whole family demanding that the behavior needs to stop. My actions ended Christmas because everyone left quickly after. I felt liberated for standing up for something I’ve been feeling for years. Last year I was looking for advice on how to manage the fallout of what I did. 

**UPDATE:** The year has been interesting.. Immediately after Christmas I sent an apology letter to my aunt. It went against some advice but my letter requested to not let the situation impact the family. I left the lack of any relationship in her hands and shared everything can change if she gives my mom a little more respect. I decided to send a letter because she lives three hours away and I’ve never spoken to her on the phone more than 30 seconds. I didn’t think a phone call would help or fix the situation, especially after I blew up.

After Christmas I apologized to my grandma for what I did. I let my grandma know I sent an apology letter to my aunt. My grandma told me she is and always wants my mom to feel like she is part of the family. I could tell my grandma was on the verge of crying when she said that. My grandma told me blowing up was not ok but understood why I did it. Hearing that felt really good. 

In regards to the letter. I got no response. My aunt denied ever getting it. We know my aunt got the letter because when my grandma confronted her about last Christmas my aunt went into a rant about several things I mentioned in my letter. My grandma did tell my aunt what she did was wrong and she needed to change. 

In February my aunt didn’t come to my Grandmas 80th birthday party. She told other family members she didn’t want to “cause an argument” so she didn’t want to come. My aunt didn’t come to my grandma’s on Mother’s Day dinner because she supposedly had to work. My family didn’t get together the rest of the year. 

Thanksgiving and Christmas came. Things are not perfect but Thanksgiving and Christmas went really well this year. I was going to post after Thanksgiving but the gathering was smaller than usual and I wanted to see how Christmas went. During Thanksgiving and Christmas everyone was very kind to my mom. It felt like everything shifted. Everyone spoke to her differently and it feels really good. My mom got to help in the kitchen for the first time ever. I know that sounds dumb but my mom has always wanted to help cook because she loves to cook. It was the first time she didn’t spend the whole day in the living room.

At one point during Thanksgiving my mom asked me to help her dry dishes. While we were washing/drying dishes my mom was smiling the entire time. At one point my mom stopped putting dishes away and randomly hugged me. We laughed and had fun the entire time. No one argued. No nasty remarks. My mom was treated as an equal and it felt really good.

In regards to the aunt that I yelled at last year. She came late to Thanksgiving.  So late, we were eating when she arrived. At Thanksgiving my mom did initiated the first interaction with my Aunt. She was not very conversational but polite to my mom. My aunt didn’t look at me the entire time. When she arrived I went to say hello and she turned away and kept her distance the entire time. She basically stated in a different room the entire time. She also left early and was the first to leave. The best part? I don’t care. I apologized and left future in her hands. If she treats my mom well she will get nothing but respect in return.

Christmas was as if nothing happened. My aunt didn’t really talk to me but she was incredibly nice to my mom. I’m ok with that. Both my parents said they have never seen my aunt so nice before. My mom got to help in the kitchen just like Thanksgiving. This year for the first time it felt like my mom was an equal in the family. Everyone was incredibly nice. No arguments, snide remarks or drama. I regret yelling but it changed everything. I think it put everyone on notice they need to change.

There was a lot of questions and comments about my dad. The comments was hard to hear but true. It helped me reflect on what my dad has/hasn’t done. The truth is my dad has been the glue of the family for years.. he spends so much time being the middle man and trying to repair issues. At times it’s been at the expense of my mom. Regardless, my dad’s lack of actions over the years doesn’t make it right. Over the summer I told my dad what I felt. I told him that I was disappointed in him and that his family has never been kind to my mom. I told him he should have done more. My dad didn’t take it well but he told me I did the right thing. My relationship with my dad is complicated. I know though I’m not going to make the same mistakes he has. We are different people and I will do whatever is needed.

If you’re reading this and have a similar situation. If you have people or someone rude in your family, try to take a moment to sit someone down. Hear them out and try to do the right thing from the start. When you have the convo, stay calm. If they are not willing to hear you.. then make it known. Blowing up could have gone either way and I’m lucky it fixed things. Try to loop in other family members before or after so they understand your reasons and can back you for your choice. My post last year gave me affirmation what I did was right, follow your heart.. it might fix years of issues.

TLDR: Last Christmas after witnessing years of rude behavior towards my Korean mom I blew up on a my aunt in front of the entire family. I demanded the behavior need to stop... with a few expletives. After I blew up it ruined Christmas. I tried to take the high road and apologize. The year was quiet and My aunt avoided the family until Thanksgiving/Christmas. Everything with my family has shifted and my mom is treated really well for the first time that I can remember. I’m glad I did what I did. Thank you for the advice.


[Update: 2021] Because of COVID, my grandma is in her 80s, and in declining health, we don’t do Holidays together. In early 2021 My brother and SIL moved back from Korea during COVID in 2020. We made Christmas amazing. My SIL is from Korea and we made Christmas amazing for her. We make her a full member of our family. We haven’t even seen my fathers side. Now we do Christmas with just my parents, no extended family. My parents cook Thanksgiving and Christmas together. I feel bad my Grandma celebrates with only one aunt (who looks after her). In some ways I’ve come realize she contributed to the dynamics too.

I truly love the holidays now. I’m now seeing someone and our families hang out. In some ways my mom gets to be the head female for the family, she doesn’t have to hide anymore."
adpyl8,I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M),19617,0.96,2753,2019-01-08 08:51:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adpyl8/i_36m_think_my_wife_of_8_years_31f_is_having_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adpyl8/i_36m_think_my_wife_of_8_years_31f_is_having_an/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it’s good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for “self care”. Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the “bad guy” and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about “Danny” and how great he is for her “self care” but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says “he only does couples” or “he’s not taking new clients”which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as “Dr. Soandso” and now he is suddenly “Danny”.  (I don’t know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird “oh you know Jenny, drama queen” kind of answer.

I think I’m going to confront them in the session this Thursday."
f71dnx,How do I (F27) tell my boyfriend (M29) that I'm not going to cancel my birthday dinner? Am I wrong for not wanting to cancel?,19576,0.91,2228,2020-02-21 04:23:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f71dnx/how_do_i_f27_tell_my_boyfriend_m29_that_im_not/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f71dnx/how_do_i_f27_tell_my_boyfriend_m29_that_im_not/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,,False,"For context: My boyfriend loss his previous girlfriend to cancer in 2016. I'm his first relationship since she passed away.  In a sad coincidence, my birthday and the anniversary of his previous GF passing away are the exact same date. We have been together for 10 months so this is the first of my birthdays since we got together.

My birthday is next weekend and as every year my parents want me to visit them for my birthday and have dinner together with my grandma. I'm only child and so is my mom, so I'm grandma's only grandchild, so they always insist in celebrating my birthday together even thought I'm an adult and I live in another city.

When I told my boyfriend about my plans and asked him to visit my parents with me he got mad at me for planning  a birthday dinner with my parents on the same date his GF passed away. I felt like an idiot for not thinking about that, and I felt bad so I told him he didn't have to come if he didn't felt comfortable going to a dinner in that date, that I was going alone.

He still got mad at me for planning to leave him alone in that date. He insisted I cancelled the plans with my parents. At first I felt really bad thinking about leaving him alone in what is a hard day for him, so I agreed to cancel the dinner. But later when I was about to call my parents to cancel it I decided  against it. My grandma is 95 years old, I don't know for how much longer she is going to be with us, and I don't want to regret cancelling a chance to see her because I don't see her very often and she would be heartbroken if I cancel.

Besides my birthday and her anniversary are obviously going to fall on the same date every year, so if I accept cancelling now he might expect me to do that every year and I don't want to stop celebrating my birthday.

How do I tell my boyfriend I change my mind about cancelling my birthday dinner without making it look as if I don't care about his feelings? Also, am I wrong for not wanting to cancel, I know that day must be horrible for him.

**Edit:** I didn't expect this post to have such a huge response. I'm still reading the comments, but thank you for all your inputs.

**Edit 2:**

1. My birthday is on March 1st, not Feb 29 (that would be cool, but i wasn't even born in a leap year).
2. I could try to re-schedule, I'm 100% sure my grandma is available every day, but I don't know about my parents, they have quite a busy schedule. Besides, it's easiest to meet up on a Sunday than any other day.
3. I know my boyfriend was seeing a therapist for some time to deal with all of these, but this was before I met him.
4. Yes, the age gap between my grandma and I is quite big. I was born in 1993 and she was born in 1924. Both her and my mom were mothers in their late 30s, hence why both my mom and I are only childs.

c13s1w,Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,19541,0.96,2397,2019-06-16 05:23:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December.  Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July.  She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week.  I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck.  The doctors said this couldn't happen.  And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then.  But she left for work and now I feel completely torn.  What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do.  I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR:  Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July.  Wife got pregnant anyways.  It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.  Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it.  What do I tell her?**

**Edit:**  I should add I've been cheated on before.  Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me.  I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

Edit: I’m honestly lost for words. You’ve all collectively made me cry with all your amazing comments. I keep saying this over and over but I’m truly, honestly, wholeheartedly so thankful for all of you and your words mean more to me than any of you will ever know ♥️

Edit 2: a lot of you are suggesting I get a gun or carry some sort of weapon but being in the UK, I can’t legally do any of these things except carry my stupid pasta fork around with me 


It might be a bit long as quite a bit happened 

I want to say thank you to everyone that really truly helped me so much in my first post, especially u/1disposabledick and u/tyedyeballoon, you both gave me so much amazing advice and I literally owe you both my life. Thank you. Everyone else as well, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I may not have been able to follow ALL of what you said but I tried for the most part

My update: 

I text my ‘boyfriend’ the day after my last post and didn’t give any explanation at all, just that this was the end now well and truly and I wouldn’t hesitate to call the police if he came round. He didn’t reply to me. He didn’t ring, text, come to my house or anything. He hadn’t got in contact with me at all and the last time I spoke to him was when we were on the way back that night 

I was really suspicious and a bit worried because I had no clue what was going to happen. I knew for a fact that he wouldn’t have just accepted it and it be done just like that. 

In the fear that came with this silence, I had a bit of a breakdown and told my mum and dad everything that had happened including that night. Both of them went absolutely spare and they both kept apologising saying they couldn’t believe they hadn’t seen it sooner

3 days later, he came to my house. My parents were out with my dog, it was the first time they’d both gone out together and left me home alone since I told them. They’d probably been out about 15 minutes before my front door was being pounded on and he was screaming to come in. I rang my dad immediately and was crying to him and saying that he was here and he said that they’d be back home as soon as they could and they’d ring the police in case I couldn’t

My front door is mostly glass so eventually he just smashed it and let himself in. I had never seen anyone this angry before, he was swearing and shouting and all I could do was stand there and sob, it was really pathetic now that I look back on it but I truly didn’t know what to do

He punched the mirror that was hanging in the hallway and it smashed to pieces and then he punched me in the face, I literally fell back to the floor with my nose bleeding endlessly 

My mum and dad came home and my neighbours were there and they were pulling him back and there was a lot of shouting and my mum was still on the phone to the police. They turned up minutes later and all of them struggled to get him into the police car

My mum took me down to A+E but I had to go in on my own because of all the virus stuff and they scanned my head and X-ray. I have a massive black eye now but no broken nose luckily. I was going to attach a picture but I don’t think I want my face on here now 

The police were at my house when I got back and I had to relay loads of shit that had happened and what led up to this. And they’ve said that if I see or hear from him I need to ring a certain number straight away. This is the start of my restraining order which both my parents agreed I should get, especially now 

He’s text me a few times since some really nasty messages, saying he was glad he punched me and he’d “been waiting to do it for a while” amongst other stuff but I haven’t been responding and instead just logging it all down with the police

I’m conflicted with how I feel. I wish it didn’t have to get to this point and I wish I’d seen things a lot sooner or done something more about it instead of giving in but on the other hand I’m glad that I can start to put this behind me. I’m crying a lot currently and my face is sore but i think that’s just down to the state things have been recently

A couple of people asked me where my fear of being out in the rain came from and I’ve decided to share why to give a bit more clarity of the seriousness of the situation. My sister and I were in a car crash back in 2018. It had been heavily raining during the ride and a lot of the roads were flooded. Her car swerved and she is no longer with us, it breaks my heart. He knew this but didn’t care

Again, thank you to everyone that gave me so much amazing advice, I honestly can’t thank you all enough because I genuinely think that you’ve all saved my life. Thank you truly x"
g3x37g,My (25M) girlfriend (24F) destroyed my tanks of fire ants.,19507,0.94,3041,2020-04-19 04:41:12,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g3x37g/my_25m_girlfriend_24f_destroyed_my_tanks_of_fire/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g3x37g/my_25m_girlfriend_24f_destroyed_my_tanks_of_fire/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Before you ask, no, she doesn't have a problem with me keeping ants. I'm quite sure that's not the reason.

We had an argument earlier today. Later I left to get groceries and let her chill out. Came back, soon saw the state of the ant room (spare smaller bedroom where I keep them). 

(guess I should give a crash course on ant farms so this makes sense: Most have two compartments. One emulates the underground colony with tunnels and chambers where the queen nests, then this is connected by a tube to a second part that emulates the above-ground world where the workers go to forage for food. Hope that makes sense. There's plenty of cool videos on Youtube of people's setups)

So anyway, my girlfriend had disconnected the two compartments, dumped the colony on the floor (so that's soil + ants) and dismantled the sides of the outworld part to leave the contents all over the place. I am lucky everything is plastic or there'd probably be broken glass everywhere too.

I've had these ants for over 2 years. There's hundreds of them. I have put hours and hours of work into growing this colony and crafting their environment. I know it will sound weird or stupid to some people but it's my hobby, similar to keeping fish in aquariums. Its like if someone dumped out your water and threw all the gravel and ornamentals around. Plus leaving your fish to die. Except while I'm sure some of the ants have died, plenty are still alive for now. They have free fucking range of the entire house now.

I am FURIOUS. Red fire ants are an invasive species that's gained a foothold in some parts of the country. Luckily not our part because of climate but as long as they're alive they'll sting any unsuspecting person who comes into contact with them or is walking barefoot. They can cause serious allergic reactions in some people. This can be FATAL. Ants are drawn to dark places so they'll very likely go into the walls. And don't worry, yes I've thoroughly alerted the other tenants in the house what happened and how to protect themselves. This is serious shit. And my girlfriend could not be fucked to think of anyone else as long as she got her ""revenge"".

I'm just so pissed because I've put so much research, always took utmost care safely handling them, never even had an accident and now it's all trashed. They're loose not because I did something wrong but because she went psycho. But everyone will still think it's my fault. Lets be real, insects and other exotic pets especially ones that pose a risk if they escape or are handled improperly aren't exactly looked well upon. The owner is always held responsible.

She did apologize. She said she just ""got carried away"" because she was upset. But I just don't know if I buy that because if she honestly had no control in the moment then why were my ants the only thing to end up destroyed. In a really thorough way at that. She knows it's importance to me. It's not like she just attacked my old books from college or something.

Also she'd been wearing shoes and gloves. That tells me the planning was there to not expose herself while exposing me and everyone else.

What the fuck should I do? I would honestly kick her out over this but it wouldn't be in the interest of public health because we're obviously quarantining together. Everyone is hunkered down. Right now we're in separate rooms as I am trying to clean this shit up best I can and she shut herself in the bedroom. No idea what to do now, I'm still in shock she did this. I'll need to fumigate the whole apartment to be sure they're gone and who knows when that will be able to happen.

PS living together for almost a year, dating for more than 2, if it matters.

TL;DR: In reaction to an argument my girlfriend destroyed my fire ants habitat while I was shopping. She apologized but I don't know if I can get over this or fully trust her. How should I handle it with her?"
gi9vko,"My 16 year old daughter found out that she has endometriosis, the idea that she may be infertile has really been affecting her and I don’t know how to help",19467,0.94,1809,2020-05-12 17:30:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gi9vko/my_16_year_old_daughter_found_out_that_she_has/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gi9vko/my_16_year_old_daughter_found_out_that_she_has/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Hello Reddit. My 16 year old daughter recently found out she more than likely has endometriosis. Her doctor didn’t wanna do the surgery to officially confirm it and instead just prescribed birth control to help with her extremely painful periods. She said the surgery was unnecessary and she wouldn’t put my daughter through the pain because of that and just kind of swept it under the rug.

It very well could not be endometriosis but something is definitely going on which is why the doctor came to the conclusion of it. Her periods are sometimes so painful that she screams and cries my name and calls me “mommy” and begs for help when she gets the pains. There’s been a few times where she’s been in the store and had to leave because she felt a big cramp coming on, which is why we took her to the doctor in the first place. Not to mention there are times when she literally wets her pants because she gets SUCH a strong uncontrollable cramp. It’s very heartbreaking seeing my baby girl go through that stuff. 

As soon as we got home from the doctors office she instantly reached to Google and found out that 30-50% of women with it are infertile. And that those who do conceive a child are 80% more likely to miscarry than those without endometriosis. 

When she found out she cried for nearly an hour. Sobbing, hyperventilating crying and it broke my heart. She told me she didn’t want kids anytime soon but knowing that someday she might not have any at all really hurt her. 

I tried telling her that there are other options if she does happen to be infertile but that didn’t help. She googled the cost of IVF and cried because it’s so expensive. She told me that it just hurts that she can’t carry her own kid.

She’s a very family oriented girl, loves children and has been babysitting since she was 10. But she’s really changed since finding this out and I don’t know how to help her. I have 5 children and she mentions that every time I try and help. It almost seems as if she’s mad at me somehow. 

She seems to be envious and loathe her brother and his wife as they recently had a baby. She blocked them on any social media and refuses to see them anymore. She doesn’t want to babysit anymore because she says it’s “pointless to gain a skill she won’t use in the future”. 

There are days that she laughs and makes horrible jokes about it, and days that she cries and questions whether or not her body is broken and useless. I don’t know how to help her. Nothing I say gets through, it breaks my heart. How can I help her?"

As the title says, I decided to break up with Jess. I kept going back and forth because I was worried I was throwing away a great thing over something that happened in the past. But the problem is I thought I really wouldn't able to get past it. 

I can't help what she did was really shitty. Yes, I know that technically she did not cheat. But she knew that I wanted a real relationship and that we were potentially moving in that direction. But, meanwhile she expected me to plan (and pay for) interesting dates, court her and prove that I was ""worthy"" of her while she happily hooked up with randos who basically did nothing but show an interest in fucking. Fuck that. 

In a follow up conversation it also came up that her friends sort of guided her to act like this. That she should basically allow herself to have fun and to keep her casual options open but with me to ""make me work for it"" and show that I wasn't just looking for sex but was capable of being a committed partner. The whole thing just seems so manipulative and ugly, and these were also mutual friends who I considered to be nice girls and now my friends as well. Now I never want to see any of those pieces of shit ever again. 

Anyway, I know this is starting to sound a bit like a rant lol, but I felt pretty pissed off and basically called it quits. The actual breakup was actually quite unpleasant. No harsh words were exchanged, but Jess cried and we kind of talked about some happy times. I guess that's the hardest part about this, like I don't think she is a bad girl and maybe we could have had a nice future together like we did over the past few months. But in the end, I do think I made the right decision, I want to be with someone who treats me well from the get-go, not someone who manipulates me while playing games just so she can have her cake and eat it too."

First of all I want to say thank you to all the kind souls who left supportive and kind messages. I tried to read them all but there were just too many.

My husband and I have decided to separate for the time being as I can’t really get over just how weird and abusive he’s been over the past few months. He is currently letting me stay in the house until we figure out the next steps and although he keeps apologizing, I’ve decided to leave him and start my life over. 

To everyone telling me to go back to my home country. I can’t. It’s not so easy. I did however call my family and told them everything and they were surprisingly supportive and we’ve talked everyday since my original post and I couldn’t be happier about that. 

To everyone who left me horrible messages. Im sorry you are so full of hate and wish horrible things on people. But I will end up stronger than ever after this. So thank you.

My husband has been nothing but supportive In my wanting to leave and start over so all I can do is figure it out and take the advice of my family and my lawyer. Yes, I’ve been in contact with a lawyer but haven’t hired her yet as I’m waiting to get the money from my husband who has volunteered to pay for it. 

Thanks again, hope this update was sufficient for everyone."

I’ll just get right to it. About 2 and a half weeks ago, my girlfriend decided that she wanted to lose weight. I have no idea how much (she won’t tell me her start weight or any of her goals), but I’m guessing it’s in the realm of 20-25 pounds. It’s no secret to me that she’s overweight, but I like her the way she is and this is the only way that I’ve ever known her. 

Anyway, she signed up for that Noom program, which is basically an app for counting calories from what I understand. She eats a strict 1200 calories per day and drinks almost a gallon of water every day. In some ways it’s been good because I get a lot of home-cooked healthy dinners, but that’s beside the point. We’ve also started going on long walks (1+ miles) every other night or so, and she picked up some yoga off YouTube. 

The problem is, since beginning her diet, her self esteem has spiraled out of control. She wakes up every morning and weighs herself and then tells me that she “doesn’t deserve food today because I gained .2 pounds overnight,” “eating is overrated,” “why don’t you break up with me for someone pretty,” stuff like that. This morning, she texted me to say that she’s been waking up an extra 30ish minutes early before work so that she has time to get back in bed and cry after weighing herself so she doesn’t burst into tears at her desk “again.” It’s nuts. 

I’ve done a bunch of research and even met with a dietitian (a friend of mine) on her behalf, and I’ve learned more than I probably needed to about women and hormones and how birth control affects weight loss and all that nonsense, but she won’t listen to me when I try to reason with her. I just want to tell her that her body is in shock from the sudden adjustment in her eating habits and she needs to tough it out for 6 weeks. She doesn’t want to hear it, she’s too busy crying over a quarter of a pound and swearing up and down that she’s doomed to be ugly forever and I’m going to leave her for a “skinny legend.”

I love her, I really do. How do I reason with her?

**last edit: I have been trying to reply to almost all the comments as they come in, and I know I didn’t get all of them, but I really do appreciate all of the insight that everyone has offered, except of course for people like my friends who are featured in the first two edits for suggesting that I break up with my girlfriend… But that’s beside the point. I think I have a good idea of the next steps that I should take as a supportive boyfriend to encourage her to get the help that she needs, and I’m hoping to be able to update you all on this soon. The only thing I haven’t enjoyed about this experience is the fact that this account that I just made this morning now has three times as much karma as my main. Thanks again**

Knowing her, I disagreed at first. She kept on insisting and I gave into the idea. I cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
A few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. Then when I finally reached her she was crying. She seemed broken. She told me that I didn't deny her strong enough. She told me that had I ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. She was mad and we broke up because I didn't deny her strongly.

UPDATE (2 weeks after the post): First off, Thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. The comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. Thanks a lot.

We had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. So, I decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. No clue about her intentions though, but I am at a much better place. Thank you reddit!"

Tonight since we’re stuck at home I figured I would try and surprise him when he got off work. I put on some lingerie and waited on the sofa around when he usually finishes his last conference call. I got a little over excited early and was touching myself a little bit, and he came out of his office. 

He looked at me, seemed disgusted and immediately goes “ugh gross, do that in the bedroom or something” and walks away. I mean I was trying to do something fun and spontaneous and he says gross? I don’t even know how to respond to that. We haven’t talked since that and I’ve just been stewing on that. 

I think I’ve gotten a little bit too much in my own head about this because my best plan right now seems like to electrocute him(joking for any that can’t tell). But I mean what kind of response is gross? Who says that?!

I need an outside perspective. How would you respond?

Update: well we had an apparently much needed conversation, and much of what was said was true, although he is neither gay nor cheating on me, and I have not gained weight, and nobody will be receiving any pictures of me. 

He said that he’s sorry for calling it gross, but he feels like he’s always the one initiating and I’m always the one saying no, and whenever I do initiate I don’t put in as much effort as him. That the fact when he just stopped trying after the first couple days I said no that it took two weeks for anything to happen only proved it to him. 

His first thought when he saw me was that I didn’t want to be interrupted, and his second was that after two weeks with nothing I didn’t even bother to ask or set a mood. And that’s apparently what culminated in the gross comment. 

So we agreed that I would try to “woo” him a bit more and make him feel more wanted, and he wouldn’t take it to heart if I happen to say no a few days in a row."

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/egvgs0/i_23m_gained_70_pounds_and_ruined_my_relationship

Sorry this is kind of long, but it did get quite eventful. 

Thank you so much to everyone who commented. It helped me see my relationship in a different light, so thank you all, even the ones who said I deserved it.

The general consensus was that she was abusive which honestly shocked me at first, I really expected every comment to support how she treated me and say she was just trying to help etc. 

I thought I deserved to be abused for gaining weight, I still kind of believe that, but I think most people treat their partners with kindness. I never want anyone to feel the way i did due to their partner. Also, the high stress/anxiety levels I felt constantly are pretty terrible for losing weight.

I had convinced myself that i was disgusting and undeserving of love and she was just trying to help, but I now realise she probably wasn't even trying to help me at all. It's hard to think that of her, because I love her a lot still despite her faults.

I realised there were a lot of things in our relationship that I was  uncomfortable with that I felt like I could never bring up because she would get upset and start crying so I would end up comforting her, or she would just turn it on me and get angry and blame me. Things always had to go her way or she would start crying.

My girlfriend was entirely dependent on me for money and I paid for literally 95% of things. She never wanted to get a job because I paid for her. I was okay with this because i loved her and felt like i had to prove myself to be worthy of her. I paid all the rent and bills.

2 days ago (NYE) I was in our bedroom on my phone when I got a text. 
It was from an unknown number calling me a ""fat fuck"" and something about how I didn't deserve my girlfriend.
This wasn't too unusual, I have been receiving abusive texts from several different random numbers for months. Mostly about my weight but also about all sorts of things. 

I had several ideas of who it could be, and it was honestly eating me up inside. It was giving me extreme anxiety because they seemed to know so much about me. 

A few hours later, on a whim I decided to call the number. I have done this before but it never got answered. I even spoofed my phone number and still nothing. 

You can probably see where this is going. Vibration came from my girlfriends bag in the cupboard. I guess she forgot to put it on silent. It was like the biggest sinking feeling I have ever felt. She had purchased a burner phone specifically for texting me abuse. She took time out of her day just to put me down anonymously and wear me down further. She wanted me to be hurt and not trust anyone around me. 

I truly never thought she was responsible for them. The thought had come into my head a couple times, but I immediately pushed it out. I didn't believe she was capable of something like that. She was always sympathetic when I got the texts and was ""trying to help me found out who sent them"".

It hurt so badly. I could almost forgive everything else but everyone has a breaking point.. I just feel completely worthless. How disgusting must i be if my own girlfriend wants to say these things to me.. why would she do this? I don't understand. I guess she wanted me to be under her control and even more dependent on her emotionally. I'm trying to get out of the mindset that I deserve this.

I knew I had to end it and I had to do it before she would make me change my mind. I gathered all her stuff up and put it into bags. I was getting extremely upset while doing it and almost stopped, but I was also angry. I don't really get angry, and I previously just accepted her treatment, but something in me just snapped. I was actually mad at her for once.

She was at her friend's house preparing to go out for NYE. I did feel guilty for ruining her night, but she had already ruined mine. I wanted to try and leave her in 2019 and start the new year without her. 

I had to do it right then before I thought about it too much and forgave her like I did for everything else she has done. 
I called a locksmith to come and change the locks. 

I knew she would have an extreme reaction to being broken up with (by her obese boyfriend who doesn't deserve her) no matter the circumstances anyway, so I just had to do it.

I texted her, ""I found your other phone. I love you (her name) but I can't put up with this shit any more. All your stuff is in bags in the hall. Please come by and collect it tomorrow. I changed the locks so you will have to let me know when you're coming beforehand. Happy new year.""

Yes...saying happy new year was a bit petty.

To say she didn't respond well to this would be an understatement. She called me crying, telling me she was sorry and would stop. She told me she was just trying to help me and that she was doing it out of love, she told me she loved me more than anything and she was so sorry... I almost believed her, but I didn't give in. I apologised to her and hung up.

She called me back 2 minutes later angry and screaming how could i dare do this to her, called me a fat disgusting piece of shit and said she never loved me. She screamed that she never wanted me and that no one ever will. She screamed that even my own family didn't care about me (this hurt because my mum was an abusive drug addict and my dad left when i was 10 and i haven't seen him since). She said that whenever we had sex she was thinking about her ex and praying for it to be over. I guess she was just trying to say anything that would hurt me.

I blocked her number. She called me back again on her friends phone screaming how dare could I block her and how dare i could leave her with no place to stay on NYE. I didn't do that, I would never leave her without a place to sleep. She could go to her parents and she has plenty money (that i gave her) so she could get a taxi and stay in a hotel if she preferred. She also said beforehand that she was staying at her friend's that night anyway. 

She posted on her Instagram story that she was ""heartbroken"" and that her ""boyfriend had left her homeless on NYE due to a little misunderstanding. After everything he put me through, he still does this. I loved him and thought he loved me, but I guess I was wrong"" 

I then received messages from her friends telling me I'm a horrible person and she deserves so much better than me. Her mother (unpleasant person) called me saying she was calling the police on me (??) and that i was abusive. She also brought up my weight and said that it was ""laughable that i would break up with her looking the way i do"" and I ""would never get anyone better"". 

All of this was stressing me out to the extreme. I hate confrontation in any form and I think i was just constantly shaking the whole evening.

My girlfriend's friend ended up calling me on a different number and said that she and her boyfriend weren't comfortable letting my girlfriend stay over at their house anymore. They were freaked out due to my gf screaming abuse at me on the phone, and she was apparently screaming at them as well and saying she was going to kill me. 

All her other friends at the house were freaked out too and she was effectively uninvited from their NYE night and they were trying to find a way to get her to leave. 

She was telling them that she had no money and no way of getting to her parents. This was just a straight up lie, I had given her £500 several days ago. I sent her an extra £100 out of guilt anyway.

I don't know where she went for a few hours but she came back to my house around 2am and started trying to kick the door in and picked up a rock and tried to smash the window (it broke the window but didn't smash all the way through). She was screaming and crying through the letter box. I ended up caving and letting her in once she calmed down somewhat, as my brother was there with me to back me up.

She was drunk and tried to attack me but I  held her back. Eventually she just started crying. I felt really bad for her at this point and was almost ready to let her stay just for the night, but thankfully my brother ended up getting a taxi with her to take her to a hotel for the night.

I felt really terrible the next day. I loved her and we spent two years together. I keep wondering if she's right, that I will never find anyone again. I can't see why anyone would want me. I also feel really guilty for what I did and I was probably too harsh on her to just kick her out like that. 

Her mother came to collect her stuff yesterday and started screaming at me, saying that I ruined her daughter's life etc etc. I feel really bad. 

I hope she's okay and I want her to get help and realise why she treats people the way she does. I know I wasn't the first, I brushed off so many stories about her and just ignored all the signs. 

With the weight loss, I am currently continuing my diet instead of water fasting like i planned. I want to try and do a sustainable diet instead of just starving myself for a month and probably gaining it back. I want to try a 7 day water fast to detox though.

I also need to stop relying on alcohol to relax in the evening, it was a big reason I gained the weight. I realised I have been consuming at least 600 calories a day in alcohol alone (3 pints of beer). I definitely used it to cope with stress and I need to develop better coping mechanisms.

I'm going to lose all the weight in 2020 and I'm also going to get into therapy so I can sort my head out, there are so many unhealthy thoughts i have and i don't think hating yourself as much as I do is normal.

I feel sad but strangely relieved and like I can actually make changes in my life without her. 




**TLDR**; found out my gf was behind abusive anonymous texts i have been receiving for months, dumped her by text on nye, caused a bit of chaos and she tried to break into my house and smash my windows. She has moved back in with her parents. I'm continuing my diet and losing weight."

Fast food. All of these times he took food from my meals without asking. And if he offers food is once and very little portions, while he takes food from my plate like the whole time.

He rarely pays for special occasions and when I pay his meals he takes the most expensive meal (XL portions), even like this, he keeps taking food from my meal every time. 

For Christmas we had dinner on an Italian restaurant and he ordered raviollies with 4 cheese sauce and carbonara pizza. The pizza was so big and he only shared half of a piece. I orderer a kind of meat pie with salad and he literally ate half of my meat pie and all of the olives from the salad without asking me. When the waiter brought our desserts, I went to the bathroom for a moment and you know what? When I came I found that he was ""tasting"" my coffee ice cream. And he didn't let me taste his dessert because ""he was so hungry"". 

He didn't pay for his meal, I payed for everything because he suddenly forgot his credit card in home... He said he would give me the money later and I am still waiting for the money. 

He wonders why I am so tiny and why he is chubby... I am thinking about dump him because I think he's laughing at my face and he's a money digger. Should I talk to him or just dump him? He ended with my patience.

Not only about the food. 

In addition I must say that he didn't get me anything for Christmas excusing himself with ""I don't have enough money"", I bought him a computer keyboard with neon lights as he wanted and he has not even been able to write a romantic letter wishing me merry Christmas. Nothing.

Update: I dumped him via chat. I don't want to waste more money on someone who doesn't care for me.

I appreciate all of your comments and advice. I already talked to him about this and all of his replies were excuses about not having money and saving money for a console while he was taking advantage of me... This is over. Thank you all. If I knew before, the first time I wouldn't dated him."

Hey guys. First of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

So, long story short, 3 days ago I ""broke up"" with her for good.

Now, you guys might not agree with the way I did it, but I did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. Even though I am sad and disappointed, at the same time I understand she wanted to see other options and I respect she didn't outright cheat on me. That being said, I am also not a backup plan and I deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

I didn't see her anymore and I finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""Hey \[name\], first of all, I don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. I took some days to think about it and I realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and I would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. I understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. Sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. I respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. I wanted to thank you for all those years and I wanted to apologize for any wrongs I did to you. I want you to know that I am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. I hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. Goodbye, op""

The message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but I realized I am already getting over it and that I no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. She replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. So, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, I am almost certain that I would accept her back. So yeah, until next time."

Our children [15F & 17M] hate me for it.,19193,0.91,3828,2019-10-18 04:12:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dje1ta/my_45m_wife_42f_revealed_she_was_unfaithful_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dje1ta/my_45m_wife_42f_revealed_she_was_unfaithful_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Edit: Guys, I appreciate the advice. But I'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. I've made my decision, and it's not something I'm willing to forgive. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

Tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. I'm leaving. Kids hate me for it."

We met between mutual friends while I was still in school and he had just moved to my town to go to college. We were friends for 2 years before we started dating. The reason for this was because 1,I was too scared to make a move and secondly, he was in love with one of our mutual friends. After she got a boyfriend, he moved on to liking me and we have been dating ever since. Last Saturday was his birthday and he told me he has never been thrown a surprise birthday party and would like to experience one. I worked all week before Saturday (his birthday), planning and inviting people, getting reservations, buying a cake, etc. I asked his best friend to hang out with him for most of the day so that I could set up and get everyone to get here and hide for the surprise. The birthday party was a success and he was smiling the whole time. He had snuck off with his best friend somewhere and I wanted to find him so that we could sing happy birthday and cut the cake. As I was walking down the hallway I heard him and his friend talking so I kept walking towards their voices. I heard him tell his friend that he should have kept trying with our mutual friend. He told him that he should have been the man that was engaged to her and not her now fiancé. He said that he hated waking up to me and that he wished that our mutual friend was the one that threw him his first surprise party. He said that he felt disgusted every time he had to kiss me or hold me because he knew that our mutual friend should be in his arms instead.He said that he felt like he was stuck in our relationship and that he would end up ""having"" to marry me. He said that our mutual friend was better than me in looks from head to toe, he said that ""she was the most gorgeous girl i've ever seen"". I went back to the party and told everyone that I couldn't find him and that we would have to wait for him to come back. When he came back, he gave me a hug and a kiss on the head and told me he loved me. I didn't want to ruin his party so I went along with it. He doesn't know that I know he doesn't honestly love me, I've just been going along with everything. I honestly don't want to break up with him, I just want to know how I can make him fall in love with me. I don't know what I did to make him feel so unhappy so I would like to know how do I make my boyfriend fall in love with me or should I just give up on our relationship? He is the first boyfriend I've ever had and I'm scared to start dating again at my age."

I know this sounds odd but it won't get out of my head.

We had a big friend get together yesterday. And at parties you split up in little groups and stuff.

I was drinking with some buddies and got tired so I went looking for my gf. They were in one of the rooms and the girls were talking about their intimate life. I wasn't even going to listen in but then my girlfriend said
""I don't care about size"". I didn't think anything of it but our friend ""Susan"" then said.

""lol you don't have much of a choice. Op has a small penis""

My girlfriend then went
""and I appreciate that Susan. I don't need a horse cock to feel something""

Then I interrupted then. First I wasn't thinking about that but this comment is bothering me so much and idk why..... I haven't talked to her. Idk what to do."

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that doesn't mean I need to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.

Edit: I'm not going to ghost or abandon them. They need to become independent now. 

Edit:  I'm reading all the comments. I know I have acted like a jerk. I just need some time to collect my thoughts. I might update later."

I know it's not going to stop anyone but the comments about my current relationship are getting a little ridiculous, as are the ones about the dog custody agreement or whatever you want to call it. You know literally nothing about my current relationship and trying to make weird judgement calls about it just makes you look stupid, as does being hung up on the dog aspect of the story. 


Edit because I'm too lazy to keep answering the same question: 
it's not altogether uncommon to have ownership/""visitation"" of a dog included in divorce proceedings! the statute or whatever it falls under was more designed for things like beach houses or boats or whatever but when both parties can't decide between themselves where the dog should live or one party causes trouble about where the dog should live the judge can make a call on what happens to keep things simple and usually civil. 


My ex and I married fairly young. we were each other's only partner and just simply outgrew each other. we divorced in 2016 and one year later I started dating my current partner. 

The only reason my ex and I are still in contact is because of our dog. we had two dogs when we were married and during the initial separation he took one and I took the other. He ""couldn't take care of"" the dog he took and gave her to his parents without asking me about it (I would've taken her) and then regretted it and threw a fit about not being able to see the other dog. It ended up going to court as part of the divorce proceedings and now I have to take the dog to see him one weekend a month. If you hadn't guessed by now his being a man child was part of the reason we divorced. 

I always wanted kids, he didn't and he was way too immature and emotionally stunted to have kids with anyway. My current partner also always wanted kids but was widowed young and didn't date again for almost 10 years after his wife died (he'd been widowed for 15 years when we met). We started trying for a baby after getting engaged in December and ended up getting pregnant pretty much right away and our baby is due in November. 

I intentionally didn't mention this to my ex. I use social media very rarely and we have chosen not to announce on social media until after the baby is born. on Saturday we met up for the scheduled dog visit, which was the first time he'd seen me in a month. because i'm fairly tall it took a long time to actually look pregnant and now I do (25 weeks). 

When I saw him he lost. his. mind. he went on this tirade about how this was evidence that I was cheating on him and how I never really loved him at all because i let the first person who came along knock me up. I was like ok wow I am not engaging in this conversation I'm only here to let you see the dog bye. 

so I left and since then he's used various masked phone numbers and sockpuppet accounts to harass and threaten me. I keep blocking them as they come up, but I am stressed and don't know what to do about it. we have generally had a cordial relationship before but now I'm like what the fuck. 

I should just say fuck this dude and fuck the stupid court ordered dog visitation and never speak to him again, right?"

I'm calling my friend Sarah, which is not her real name. I'm being purposely vague.

I always knew that I wasn't the pretty one. We've been friends since we were really young and I've seen her go from awkward kid to really, really pretty. In school people always asked her out and they'd do extra stuff for her that she never seemed to notice. I used to be jealous, but we've talked about how I felt back then, I have a boyfriend who makes me feel beautiful now, etc. and I thought I was over it.

Recently, since we gained more subscribers, people have been making comments about how sad it must be to be the ugly one. Some of them say my name but most of them talk about my features that make it obvious that they're talking about me. I've even had people privately messaging me to suggest plastic surgery.

It's hurting my relationship with Sarah. I know she's prettier than me but until this it wasn't really a problem anymore. Being compared to her constantly is hurtful.

She's suggested that we make both of our instagrams private and make a joint public one so that we can better control the new hatred towards me. I'm worried that will just bring up questions and I'll have to explain that I'm so hurt by people saying this stuff and it's damaging my friendship so much that we've both had to be private. She even suggested that if it gets too bad, we should phase out the channel because it isn't worth becoming bitter towards each other because of youtube.

I just want to know how to feel better about being friends with her. Sarah has never made me feel ugly, it's always been other people. She's the kindest person I know and it makes me even more annoyed because I know she doesn't have control over this any more than I do.

edit: I'm not going to tell anyone the channel. It's insanely unlikely that you'll be interested in our very niche subject and I'd find it really uncomfortable that certain fans knew what I was dealing with before I'm ready to speak about it publicly. Also, I think it would count as self advertising and I don't want the post to be deleted.

final edit: huge thank you to u/sloth_jones. They suggested a program that allowed us to find out where the comments might be coming from, and it's an incel forum. It's not just random people finding us and making nasty comments, it's sad, disgusting people who have been pointed to our channel because they dislike the fact that I have a boyfriend, Sarah doesn't, and they don't have girlfriends. Also, I've contacted my therapist and will be continuing with therapy. Thank you so much everyone who helped me. I've tried upvoting everyone I can get to."

I like to think that we're very happy, while we have our downs, I'm more happy with her than I have ever been. She is always there for me when my depression is too much to handle and never judges or makes me feel weak when I ask for help. The problem lies in my emotional constipation, like a lot of men I just find it impossible to get it out and sometimes I feel like the raincloud to her sunshine, and I think that gets to her. 

To get to the crux of the story, today her and I were listening to some music while working on some uni work, when the song ""Whatever will be, will be"" came on. I heard her softly singing along behind me, and out of no where stood up and said ""come over here a second"", we then goofily slow danced in our small room until the song changed. When it did I looked down at her and she had tears in her eyes while smiling at me. She said I was the ""sweetest boy she's ever met"" and wiped her tears before returning to her laptop.

I really like it when she feels like this, and while this definitely isn't the first time it's happened, I don't feel like it happens as often as she deserves. I love her and tell her I do everyday, but I think actions speak louder than words

What I'm asking for is, what is something unique I could do for her, maybe some techniques to get my emotions out, I'm just drawing a blank as always. Thank you in advance.

Edit: I unfortunately have to go to bed as it is 2am my time, but I just want to thank all of you for your help tonight, I've been an avid reader of this sub for quite a while and shot my shot not expecting to get all that much advice based on my story not being the most dramatic.

Sincerely thank you all so much for your help, the little things that you've all described are going to make her feel so happy. I've actually taped a ""I love you"" note to the mirror for her to find in the morning as per one of your suggestions. I just honestly can't thank all of you enough. I wish you all the best

Final edit: I didn't expect this to blow up while I was sleeping, firstly thank you to everyone who posted a comment to direct messaged me, save for the assholes who said they hoped she got cancer or I faked the whole thing, this has opened a whole avenue of ways for me to more properly understand my own emotions and in turn show her love more easily. 

For anyone in the comments suffering from a similar situation as mine, I would suggest looking into love languages.

Two last things, sorry to anyone I haven't been able to reply to, I really didn't expect to get so many comments. And also, please stop giving awards to me, this is a throwaway account and your money is best spent on yourself, especially now.

Have a nice day everyone, kia kaha."
izrhmn,Wife's parenting technique is negatively impacting our 5 y/o daughter,18810,0.97,1113,2020-09-26 02:06:30,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/izrhmn/wifes_parenting_technique_is_negatively_impacting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/izrhmn/wifes_parenting_technique_is_negatively_impacting/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"My 5 year old daughter has alopecia. It's an autoimmune disease for those that don't know that attacks the hair follicles. Usually hair that falls out doesn't grow back at all but sometimes it will. It can affect the entire body. My little girl was diagnosed at 2, and has so far only lost hair on her head. There are huge patches on the top of her head that are completely bald now  There's no cure and her mom and I had decided to avoid the risky treatment options currently available since she's so young.



The older she gets, the more aware of her condition she obviously is. She spends a lot of time with her cousins and little girl friends that are similar ages and she's mentioned to me countless times that she wishes she had their hair. It breaks my heart as her father. I've taken her to a few playdates and kids that have never met her always ask about her hair. She parrots off the explaination of the disease to them that her mom has taught her and then acts shy the rest of the time she's there . At home she has a doll that has different wigs that she loves playing with and changing them.



I worry that my wife is not putting our daughters feelings and concerns first. She made a Facebook post about Alopecia awareness month with some pictures of our daughter's hair loss and showed them to her. Our little one got sad seeing the picturesld the back of her head (where the hair loss is worst) and asked if she could get a wig like her dolly. Her mom said ""absolutely not, you know you are just as beautiful as everyone else and you don't need one."" As true as this is, I just want my little girl to feel confident and beautiful.



My wife believes that the best thing to do about her hair loss is to completely ignore it, and just mention what alopecia is to anyone who asks about her hair. I thought it was a good idea at first because I too want my child to love herself as she is. However, since she has brought these issues up on her own it changes the way I look at the situation and if she wants a wig or hats or whatever to feel ""normal"" then I want to do that for her. Kids are also super cruel and disease or not- I worry that she will eventually be bullied due to this. How can I approach this topic with my wife and show her that this parenting technique is hurting our daughter?"

Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. I haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. There's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

My family agrees with a lot of you. They're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. Just give me some time. I'm not going to make another update post, because I've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe I'll just update this post in a few days after I've decided what to do."
ihoydd,I [30F] just found out my husband [32M] might be the father of my best friend’s [34F] child [4F]. What the hell do I do now?,18782,0.94,1532,2020-08-27 22:37:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ihoydd/i_30f_just_found_out_my_husband_32m_might_be_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ihoydd/i_30f_just_found_out_my_husband_32m_might_be_the/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Yesterday I received a call from my best friend’s (Amy) husband (Paul) claiming my husband was the father of her four-year-old daughter (Kim). He said they got into an argument and she blurted out that Kim isn’t his daughter and that Kim regularly spends time with her real dad (my husband). He snooped and found out her dad was my husband. I’m so shocked and angry, I don’t know what to do.

Paul claims he has evidence of their ongoing long-term affair and he would like to meet up with me to show me it. I don’t know if I should go. (edit: he wants me to meet him alone at his house) A part of me wishes he’d never told me. I asked him to send me something over text first because I honestly didn’t believe him and he sent me a blurry video of Amy having sex with someone. She was moaning my husband’s name, but you couldn’t really tell if it was him in it because it was so dark. He sent me a few texts between them too, I wish I could unread them. I feel numb and sick.

I haven’t confronted my husband yet, I don’t even have the energy to do that. He noticed something was off when he got home and asked me if I was okay, but I just shrugged it off and told him I was going to sleep. He decided to work from home today because he was worried I wasn’t feeling well. I wish he hadn’t.

To make things worse me and Amy are both pregnant. I’m 5 months and she’s 7 months. Paul claims that baby is also my husband’s. He said he was planning to sue my husband for all of the money he spent raising his child and Amy was planning to put him on child support. He said he was warning me in advance so I could apply before her. They’re going to get a divorce.

I just can’t believe he would do this. I just keep hoping Paul will text me saying it was all a joke. Amy keeps texting me telling me she’s sorry, I’ve ignored her so far but I want to rage at her.

I don’t know what I’m going to do if we get a divorce. I don’t think I can raise my baby alone.

I feel dumb for posting this but I have no idea what I should do… Shall I just pretend I don’t know?

TL;DR – My best friend’s husband claims heir four-year is my husband’s and that the baby she is currently pregnant with is also his. I’m also pregnant. I haven’t confronted him. What do I do now?

UPDATE:

I spoke to Amy. Turns out my husband isn’t the person she’s been having an affair with. When she told Paul he just assumed it had to be my husband because of the name. She said he went berserk, and she was too scared to correct him. Her and Kim are safe at her mother’s house. I told her about him wanting me to come to their house and she warned me not to so.

EDIT:

No, she never showed me proof and no I haven't spoken to my husband yet (I will soon). I don't know if I believe her, I just added the info because I was getting a lot of messages to update."
h130y2,I think that my (26f) fiancé (31m) masturbates to me while I'm asleep and gaslights me about it,18707,0.9,2732,2020-06-11 22:20:44,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h130y2/i_think_that_my_26f_fiancé_31m_masturbates_to_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h130y2/i_think_that_my_26f_fiancé_31m_masturbates_to_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"TLDR: I am almost certain I caught my husband masturbating to me in my sleep several times. He denies it and blames it on the mental illness running in my family. I suspect he drugged me, but I can't be sure. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills...

The summary above says most of it. For context, my mother has schizophrenia and so do I, but unlike mom, I am high-functioning; I have a Master's degree and a high-paying job and never had meltdowns. I have common auditory hallucinations, rare visual hallucinations, common depersonalization episodes, that's about it. I take Abilify in small doses, I don't even have a therapist, I'm doing just fine. I moved in with my fiancé, ""Bob,"" about two years ago. We don't have a very active sex life (mostly because he claims he has a low sex drive, which is fine by me) but we're a very ""dialogue-oriented"" couple based on mutual respect, which is why I'm with him in the first place. We can (could?) say anything to each other, and he knows everything about my mental illness.

Troubles started about two months ago. Before that, I had vaguely heard some things that sounded like Bob masturbating in the bed next to me at night, but I didn't care enough to look into it. He masturbates, big deal, right? Two months ago, I was woken up by him fapping with so much energy that his hand kept bumping against my ass and the whole bed was shaking. I made it clear I was awake, and he stopped right away. Okay, whatever. A few minutes later, he started again. I spoke up, said that I'm fine with him fapping but could he do it in the bathroom? I'm trying to sleep. *He denied doing it* and told me I was dreaming. Okay, whatever, I roll over. A few minutes later, without fail, *fap fap fap*.

I tried to talk to Bob about it, and we can usually discuss every topic freely, but he stonewalled me right away. He denied everything, including *ever* masturbating, and he kept chalking it up to me dreaming it. I was convinced I wasn't dreaming and double down, and Bob got *angry* like I'd never seen him get angry before and said he wouldn't tolerate these ""accusations."" I wasn't accusing him of anything, I was trying to be understanding and have a discussion. I told him that if that was a fetish of his or whatever, we could incorporate it into our sex life, that I don't mind pretending to be asleep or whatever to turn him on. He denied everything very strongly and refused to discuss it further.

I'm working from home and Bob has to go to work every day, so I figured I could afford to stay awake later at night to keep watch. Without fail, within days, I was pretending to sleep and Bob was masturbating to me. It happened several times, and I confronted him every time. He started blaming my schizophrenia, saying that I'm having delusions and that I'm hallucinating the whole thing. He strongly recommended that I increase my prescription medication. I repeatedly told him that I know he is doing it even though he denies it - that there is no shame in it and that he can just admit it, but he violently denies **everything.**

Last night was the worst one so far. I woke up in the middle of the night to Bob kneeling on the bed by my face and fapping just inches away from it. I recoiled and was like ""WTF?!"" but I was feeling super drowsy, like kinda seasick and confused. I got up and tried to fully wake up, while Bob was loudly telling me that nothing was happening and that I was hallucinating it all. I'm not sure how I fell back to sleep, but I woke up this morning with the sun high and Bob already gone for work.

Bob'd left a note telling me that my illness is getting worse and that I need to call my psychiatrist asap to get reevaluated. I think that's bullcrap. I looked through Bob's things and found sleep aids that he got like a year ago but never used - but the box is mostly empty. These things dissolve in water and Bob has a million opportunities to feed them to me, and I'm starting to think he's been drugging me for a while now to keep me asleep while he does he thing at night. I haven't confronted him about that yet and I don't know if I should. I can't erase the possibility that I am indeed somehow hallucinating all of that - I have seen my mom convince herself of the craziest things that look absurd from the outside but seem fully real to her. I don't want to end up like that. But I also feel like I *can't* be wrong, you know? That surely I can't have imagined all that. I don't know...

My question is: What do I do next? Am I being gaslighted? WTF is going on?"

> It really looks like OP is only considering this for financial reasons.

I'm in debt because of I can't afford to provide the basic necessities for my daughter. I live off paychecks and take cash in hand jobs. I skip meals. I don't regret any of it. I would take a bullet for her. This is a really hurtful comment. I just want her to have a better childhood than I did.

Edit:
 > I'm ashamed to say, I don't know if I want her.

I want to clarify this. I don't know if I will be a good dad. I'm not the model dad. No real education and a criminal record to my name. I think I'm still depressed and I can't get over the fact that my other half is not here with me. I am going to act on the advice and get some therapy.

Edit: this was supposed to be post yesterday but the previous post needed to be up for 48 hours before I could post 


First off thank you everyone! I really needed that motivation to take control! And I’m sorry I didn’t reply to everyone just a lot of things happened 

It happened this morning before my dad and brother went to work. My dad said (loosely translated) “Your brother already got a job when are you going to get one” and I’m basically occupied with college because I’m mostly studying and I got annoyed when he said that and with the confidence you guys gave me I told him that I’m not comfortable with how everyone is treating me. He said that he was just joking and that I’m apparently still too young and he can’t take me seriously. I basically said fuck you im leaving and went to pack my stuff.. he came after me and started pulling me saying that I’m not going anywhere. I pushed him and told him that he doesn’t decide anymore and he told me if I leave this house I’m never welcomed again. I continued packing my stuff and he started getting physical and pushing me so I pushed him back. He made a fist like he’s going to punch me but my brother stopped him and basically dragged him to the other room where I could hear them screaming at each other. I packed my stuff and went to a friend because I didn’t know where to go. My friend skipped work so he can be with me In case something happened (still hasn’t) and that I can stay with him as much as I have to. That all happened in the span of 3 hours and I’m still shaken and I’ll probably get a restraining order because if he pushes me again I’ll probably hit him. My mom is blowing my phone all day but I’m not picking up and I think I’m done with this family. I just hope nothing serious happens

[Update 2] I talked with my brother to meet up somewhere so he can give me some documents I needed and we met. We talked for a bit but he basically told me that my parents don’t want to see me again and I was okay with it. He told me if I needed something from him to call him but I don’t think I will. I will be staying with my friend until the virus is over and I can find a place. He said he will hook me up for a month or two until I get my first pay check and after that I’ll have to pay. I already found a job it’s not the best and it doesn’t pay much but I can’t be a chooser right now. I guess my adult life begins ;’)

Edit: holy this blow up! I’m trying my hardest to read every comment but they are just too many.. i saw that everyone is saying that I should keep in touch with my brother. First off I’m never leaving my brother he’s my brother and I love him so much.. he’s one of the people who always supported me no matter what I did and he is the most important person in my life as of now. When I said that I wasn’t going to call him I meant that I wasn’t going to call him if I needed his help. I decided to do things alone and in my own way but I’ll always keep in touch with him no matter what. I also saw that some people say I overreacted. My father literally made a fist and was about to swing but my brother stopped him. If he wasn’t there things would’ve been way worse and I needed to leave that place. And I didn’t mind getting a job when he said that. I’ve actually been looking for a good job that I can fit in my schedule but because of the virus I have not been able to and my father knew that he was just making fun of it.  But thank you everyone! The supportive comments and the critical comments!"

**In addition to all kinds of weird comments I'm getting all kinds of weird PMs so I think I need to just...take a deep breath, walk away, mindlessly binge watch something stupid for awhile and cry my face off tonight. I called around to a few family lawyers in my area, and the advice I got from posting here has been absolutely brilliant, but I'm running out of the sass/steam to deal with anything else that's happening here so I'm just going to check out. I'm going to leave the legal business to the lawyers, pray that he didn't give me false information and I can actually find him, and try to remember how much I was looking forward to being a mom before all of this happened. I don't really care if people think it's fake or whatever because I gained exactly nothing (aside from the advice that I needed) from making this post and I gain exactly nothing from arguing.**

**To everyone who shared their stories with me: thank you. thank you so much. you feel like the dumbest fucking person in the world when this happens to you and knowing it happens to people all the time is a weird comfort even when you wouldn't wish it on anybody. I don't think of myself as a trashy or generally stupid person, just a person who was blinded by love and naivety and has learned a really hard lesson a really hard way.** 

**I doubt anything of monumental concern will happen between now and my Monday induction, but once baby is here I will try to come back and let people know what's happening.**

&#x200B;

Edit: thank you all. It seems like getting legal help is priority #1.

I'm just in shock right now. Like I almost feel numb, but I really appreciate everyone here for your help. I was really happy and looking forward to baby and I just feel really sad right now so I need to take a breather. Everything is ready for the baby and I'm still excited to meet them, but Jesus.

So first off I know the age gap probably should've been a red flag but I was stupid.

We've been together for two years but he lives in a different city. When I got pregnant, he said he was going to move to my city and we would move in together, he just needed to finalize some things with his ex wife. He told me he was divorced when we met and I never had any reason to question it. I knew that he had 2 kids with her as well, he told me the truth about that, just not that he wasn't divorced (or even separated).

So fast forward, I'm 39 weeks and he suddenly got uncommunicative which is less than ideal when you're literally about to give birth. Bear in mind that he was supposed to have been fully moved in here a month ago (blamed covid).

Today I found out I am going to be induced on Monday unless baby decides to come out over the weekend so I contacted him and I was like okay what's going on? And that's when he told me that he isn't actually separated or divorced, he never told his wife about anything, and now he felt like he was backed into a corner.

I don't feel sorry for him for that because that's his own fault, but obviously literally four days before giving birth isn't the time you want to get this news and I have no idea what to do now.  Tell him to fuck off, obviously, but what else?  I feel like I mean I CAN take care of the baby but I was preparing to have a partner to take care of it with me, you know?

I don't even know what I'm asking for in terms of advice but any advice for moving forward and handling this is appreciated."
eawrlx,"My husband(45M) and I(43F) found my daughter(15F) asleep after masturbating, and he's furious. What do I do?",18453,0.79,863,2019-12-15 14:24:23,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eawrlx/my_husband45m_and_i43f_found_my_daughter15f/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eawrlx/my_husband45m_and_i43f_found_my_daughter15f/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,True,False,False,"WARNING: NSFW. I am fairly new to Reddit, so apologies for any mistakes. I would also like to preface this by begging you to not make any lewd comments about my daughter. They would be wholly unhelpful and very upsetting to me.

Background: Husband and I happily married for 21 odd years, he was raised Christian, I was not. We have three wonderful children - R(20F), M(15F) and L(7M). I would say we haven't had too many issues, apart from R being diagnosed with minor depressive disorder and L being diagnosed with stage three (severe) autism. This had an impact on our family dynamic and marriage obviously, but we've worked through it over the years. M also has an odd condition where she falls asleep incredibly easily. This has led to fairly minor issues such as falling asleep in class, on public transport and other such places. We have visited a few specialists about this, but it really doesn't seem to be anything of concern. We, as a family, visited therapy for a few months as a trial, but it really just didn't work at all. R was very opposed and stayed defensive for most of it, and my husband and I already talk outside of therapy, so there wasn't much hidden or to talk about.

So, two days ago, my husband, L and I went shopping for a few hours. R was studying at a local library, so M was home alone. (This is a regular occurrence and I must stress that she has absolutely *never* experienced issues of safety, responsibility or otherwise. This system works for us.) When we came back, M wasn't in her room, and the bathroom door was closed. After a few minutes of knocking on the door and calling out, I got a bit anxious and called out ""We're coming in, M!"" (In my mind, she could've hit her head and fallen unconscious, or something worse.) My husband then opened the door to see... M, lying in the bathtub, fast asleep, phone in her hand, no pants on. Her... Place was angled close to the faucet and was wet, so it was fairly clear that... something had happened. I walked in to check she was okay, breathing etc. After all, maybe she was just practising good vaginal hygiene? I decided to leave her there, and I grabbed her phone to go plug it in, but to my surprise, it was on. It had... a pornographic video paused on the screen. I was fully blindsided by this, as was my husband, who had seen all of it. He got this odd expression on her face, marched past me and slapped her across the face. I immediately cried out and pushed him away from her, but M woke up and started crying. I felt awful so I pulled him out of the room and left her there to collect herself, but I had a feeling it was too late.

Now, my husband is absolutely fuming at M. I have NEVER seen him like this before. He says he's angry about a few things, which I don't quite understand:

1. Masturbation. He believes its a sin and is absolutely disgusted that she did it in the first place.
2. Where she learnt it from, apparently. He is now 100% convinced she has or has had a boyfriend (or multiple?) that have taught her to do this. He even implied that perhaps she was in contact online with older men who had groomed her into it.
3. The bathtub. He is so incensed that she was in the bathtub, a place we all use. I agree a little on this, but just that it's quite frankly a bit icky of her to do it in our family bathtub when we're out. I don't think it's an egregious sin of her to do it there, it's just a bit bleh.
4. The water bill. He firmly believes that M has done this before, and is now losing his mind over the fact that she must have spent a lot of water on this. I understand this, but I think it's sort of the least important issue at hand.

I fully sat him down and talked it through with him to explain that masturbation is a natural thing and that she has a right to her body, but he's still incredibly upset about point 2. I think I've talked him down a bit, but he is still absolutely enraged at her actions, and I don't know what to do or say..

Meanwhile, M has been absolutely distraught. I've tried talking to her on multiple occasions, but she hasn't spoken to anyone in the family since the incident. The most recent time was a few hours ago, I sat her down and essentially said, I love her 100%, and I don't *really* mind what she does with her body as long as she is very careful, and I requested that she stay safe, especially when talking to others. She didn't say a word, just teared up and locked herself in her room again. My husband is taking this as a surefire sign of guilt and has taken her devices (laptop, phone) multiple times to see if she has any connections (to boys or men, I think) that he could find. All she really has is Discord and Instagram (that we know of). Her discord is used very sparsely to communicate about a Minecraft server she's on, and as far as we can tell, her Instagram is only used for liking pictures (generally only pictures of food, DIY videos and her friends' pictures). This has further convinced my husband that she has a second account somewhere. I don't know what to say to that, because whilst that is a large possibility, there isn't much to prove there.

R doesn't know the details of what's going on, but I can assume that she's guessed by now, and L has absolutely no concept of what's going on. This is so incredibly out of character from the both of them that I just truly don't know what to do. I feel like a failure of a mother. Therapy didn't work before, so I have no reason to believe that it'll work now, especially with M being so unreceptive. Understand, this is the first incident my husband has EVER acted like this throughout our entire marriage. What do I do? What do I say, to the both of them, to keep my family together?"

I’m sorry that I haven’t been responding, I posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so I haven’t had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. I am still at work so I won’t have time until later to read through everything.
I wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. It has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt I have been facing. He really had me questioning this entire situation and whether I was overreacting or not. I am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. I can update again afterwards.
Thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. Even if my opinion isn’t valid to him, at least it’s valid to all of you!


I don’t want to cause any political debates. If it’s necessary for context: obviously I believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

I’m so confused, I don’t know what to think. I’m not even sure if this is the proper sub but I just feel that I need some advice.

In the time I have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so I thought. Politics was never an issue between us at all. However he just admitted to me that over the past year he’s grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are American) and that they should not be allowed to vote... He says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

I’m upset and I can’t tell if I’m wrong to be upset about this because I know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now I just feel as though he doesn’t even value my own input/views. He has assured me that he still thinks that I should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

This is a person I have been with for almost 5 years. We’ve talked about marriage. I don’t know what to think. In all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and I can’t imagine my life without him in it. But this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

Am I wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? As his girlfriend am I supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though I may (strongly) disagree? I can’t tell if I’m overreacting to this or not. The whole situation has made me feel terrible and I’m so confused."
j09xqg,My (24F) boyfriend (26M) almost got me fired from my job,18394,0.95,1225,2020-09-26 22:47:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j09xqg/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_almost_got_me_fired_from_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j09xqg/my_24f_boyfriend_26m_almost_got_me_fired_from_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I won’t disclose my job position as I  am attempting to stay anonymous, but I work with client files that can contain sensitive information, and since COVID I have been working from home, with a company computer.

I got a call a few weeks ago and it was my supervisor as well as HR, and our department manager. They called me into the corporate building (of our area) to come in and talk, so I knew it was serious. They kept asking me if I knew a Lindsay Parks (for the sake of the story I’ll call this person Lindsay Parks). I was confused and said no, and they told me that I had opened her file unauthorized. (I’m not allowed to deal with files for people that I know, or open files that I’m not assigned to). 

I was confused and denied it because I really didn’t know this person, so they opened the file to see if there was an associated party on the file that I know. And lo and behold my boyfriend’s name was listed as an associate party. I had to tell them this was my boyfriend, and they said they were going to going to place me on suspension until they investigate.

I got home and when my boyfriend got home I told him what had happened. He got a bit red in the face, and then admitted that he used Lindsay’s number to look up her file and see if there were any updates as he knew I worked for the company and that she hadn’t heard from them and wanted to check out her file. 

I told him this wasn’t okay and I’m probably going to get fired for his carelessness, and who Lindsay was and why was he was listed as an associate party on her file. He said a friend, and then went back to saying how it wasn’t his fault and that he didn’t know I’d get in trouble, and that I shouldn’t have made my work password something he’d know.

They finished their investigation, and after my boyfriend confessed, I had surprisingly gotten my job back. I have since been working in an empty office at the corporate building because they don’t want anything similar happening again.

Communication with my boyfriend has been very limited except for if it pertains to our daughter. I feel like he tried gaslighting me and this situation just is making me feel extremely uneasy 

TLDR: my partner wen to. My work computer, opened a file for a “friend”, and almost got me fired by doing so. Now I’m working in the corporate building to prevent this from happening again, and our relationship is strained after it feels like he gaslighted me into thinking this was my fault"
bjikr9,"My ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), I was starting to heal until I found out the reasons why he ghosted.",18363,0.89,1435,2019-05-01 21:11:45,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bjikr9/my_ex_29m_decided_to_end_things_by_trickle/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bjikr9/my_ex_29m_decided_to_end_things_by_trickle/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"The past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

My ex, ‘Tom’, and I had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so I thought. We had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). I was happy, and I thought he was too. We had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, I could go on. 

Everything was fine until our last trip together. We went to a destination where I had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something I’d have to wait longer to do. It was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. Once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

After we landed (the last time I saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. I didn’t think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. I tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn’t respond. I started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. From there our communication basically broke down. I can’t say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn’t remove me from any social media. From that point I’d try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn’t respond. After about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then I wouldn’t hear from him for several more days. What hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with New Years, Valentine’s Day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn’t even wish me a happy whatever. 

I felt like I was going crazy. I had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  I was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. I stopped going out as much, and didn’t really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. I found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse I could think of whenever I showed up somewhere without him. 

I eventually broke down, I contacted one of his good friends who I felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. I told her that Tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he’s only sent me a few text messages and I have no idea what’s going on. I told her I didn’t know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that I needed to know about. She looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that Tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and I that I was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. This was soul crushing to hear and I felt humiliated and worthless. I told her this wasn’t the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. She said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

Throughout March and April I felt like I was starting to heal some. I felt broken, but I started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. I told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. Then I found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

He had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. Not sure how long, but a little less than a year. I’m also hurt because I know the person he cheated on me with. She’s an absolute garbage person. And I’m not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. She has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. I’ve heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the LGBT community and non-Christians. She is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn’t need it. She somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government’s eyes. I think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, I’m really not sure. I can’t really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. I’ve always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. Not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can’t help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. Her parents have paid for her car and I think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. She spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and I frequent and will interject herself into our outings. She has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

Tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew I wouldn’t approve. Then he started to get high and then have sex with her. He felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn’t enough for him to stop getting high with her. His intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. This woman hated my guts, and kept pushing Tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. He didn’t want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

Tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. So she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. He came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

I only found out about this, because the same friend I had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that Tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that I deserved to know the truth in case he isn’t forward with what happened. 

1. There is no way in hell that I’d get back together with Tom
2. I can’t help but feel like absolute dog shit that Tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and I'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. I don’t know if I could contain my urge to slap him, or if I would just break down and sob. I was doing well from moving on from him. I was starting to feel happy again. Now, I think I’m back at square 1. I'm depressed and stressed out. 

Is there anything I can do? I kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over."

My girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, I finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company I did my internship at and within a year I got a promotion and a large payraise and I am now making roughly 150K a year, while she makes 20K a year.

Now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place I bought so I pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, Phone bill, netflix and so forth.

Now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently I pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

Now she seems to be jealous I got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs I put the majority in my savings account.

In my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

So what do I do, I hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if I am honest I am questioning my relationship as there is no way I am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

Edit: So, there are so many comments I am having a hard time keeping up with it. If I don't respond, know that I am trying to at least read your comment. But currently when I read and respond to 1 comment I get 10 more! Haha. I just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... Even those who yell about Mgow or something and those who are if the opinion I need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! I had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha."

So I've made a lot of changes in my family life since I posted this a couple weeks ago. I first told everything to my boyfriend. He was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. He also respected that I didn't want her to meet him. 

I decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?

I told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

I blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

Then, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. 

I told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. 

Then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

I ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

I don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

My boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. 

Overall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. 

TL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future."

Both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. When I was sent to live with my dad, I was broken. I barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  I wasn't mad or angry. I was null of any kind of emotion. Basically I was alive but wasn't living. I kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. I was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. I was more social with my dad but I kept it to a bare minimum.  I had noting left to say to anyone. It took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. That's how withdrawn I had become.

Dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  When I experienced night- terrors, I would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  He drove me to all of my therapist appointments. He made sure I was eating properly. There were days, I would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. He literally went above and beyond for me. I hated the city that were living in. Because  I had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

I was so passive, it was scary. My therapist had told my dad that I was stuck in the victim's cycle; I didn't know how to get out. Because of this, I was bullied quite a bit. By the time I was 15, I had been to 3 different schools. It got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. I was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. Noting would motivate me.

Looking back, Dad did spoil me but at the time I wasn't aware of it. I was so in my own body that I barley acknowledged my surroundings.   If I asked my dad for a new bed spread, I would get me new one plus new furniture. My phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. I was grateful and thanked him. I did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. Again I was being polite. I didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. I barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

By the time I was 16, Dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. I didn't question it. He had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. I didn't think it was any of my business so I didn't press the issue. A year later, Dad had divorced my stepmother. One of Dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in Boston and he took it. We moved and I felt I was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. That year was probably the best year of my life. I was coming out of my shell. There was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. It was if I was like everyone else. I felt ""normal"". I became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, I was going out more. Us moving probably saved my life.

Because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. There was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. You could just sense it. It got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

Me and Dad have always been close. When I had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, I could see my dad crying in the crowd. I lived with my dad while I attended college ( I still do for the time being) . Ever since I was child, I always wanted to be a doctor. Well, I just finished my first year of medical school. Honestly, I feel like a normal young adult in society. I have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom I've been with for 4 years. I'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

Recently, I got FB message from my half-sister. She was apologizing a lot and I had no clue what she was talking about. Turns out, the reason why Dad and I moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what I was watching her change........... Yes. She told her mom that I was watching her change.. At the time, I was traumatized of sex. Heck I was terrified of any form of intimacy. The kid was envious of what Dad was doing for me. She was so envious that she tried to move me out. Well I guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and I'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. Because we moved out, I think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. How can someone be so cruel? What did I ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. I didn't even respond. More importantly, Dad never let this to get back to me. Chances are if I had heard about this when I was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. It also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

This is a lot to take in and I have a new found of respect and love for my dad. He gave up this marriage for me so I could live a normal life.Dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. I'm missing him a lot lately.

Should I bring it up to him when he returns? Also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? At the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and I almost want to help.

Tl;dr: Dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. Dad kept it from me for 6 years. Should I bring up with him?

Edit: I wasn't expecting such a huge response. I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. It will take some time but I will read all of them or as much as I can. As I was going through the comments, I found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. This a part of my life. I don't normally like to talk about about this . Aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. The fact the people are saying that it's fake.... I don't what to say. It's not my place to try and convince anyone. Believe  me, they're times I wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. When I wrote this, I wasn't thinking about syntax. It was more just getting this out. People questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. Forgive me but I wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

As for how I became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; I did respond to it in the comments but I'll post it here too. 

""It was very unorthodox how I became valedictorian after attending a real HS for only a year. My overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because I was in online classes for my previous hears, I wasn't eligible at the time. I met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

I broke down in front of the coordinator and I told her the truth. Being named valedictorian was something I always wanted. To be that would have been my first accomplishment that I would have achieved based on my own merit. Yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. It wasn't trying to be Valedictorian financial reasons. Money wasn't a problem (Dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. This would have helped me self-worth as well.

The girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and I told her the truth. She actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. It something I'll forever be grateful for. That's actually how me and her became friends."". Not many people would do that and in HS. 

I'll be posting again. I just need a few days."
gy1vd4,My (26F) boyfriend (27M) ran off in the middle of the night with our newborn son (2 weeks M),18063,0.95,1090,2020-06-07 05:27:28,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gy1vd4/my_26f_boyfriend_27m_ran_off_in_the_middle_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gy1vd4/my_26f_boyfriend_27m_ran_off_in_the_middle_of_the/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"First time posting, on mobile. Sorry this is long. 

As title says, we have a newborn son who is two weeks old. To recap the period leading up to this event:

We had the baby on a Thursday and came home on Saturday. Roses. Everything was absolutely beautiful. Our relationship had never been stronger and we were so so happy. More in love with each other and with the little one then we thought possible. On Sunday we decided to pop a bottle of champagne. I have one glass and he continues saying “we can get drunk now!” I obviously didn’t want to get drunk but did not discourage him since we hadn’t drank in months (we used to drink together nightly). He ended up quite belligerent by the end of the night and it resulted in tears on my end since he was acting out of character. The next morning he sincerely apologized and said that if he ever got drunk like that again, he would stop drinking. That evening rolls around and we have a glass of wine with dinner. I did not want another but he continued to finish the bottle, and another. Drunk again, more tears. I explain to him (while he was drunk) the conversation we had the night prior about him not doing this and he broke down and came to bed and promised not to again.

After a week of being home, my mother begins to travel to us (we live in CO, she lives in NY) to visit us for two weeks to help get settled with the baby. This visit has been planned for 4 months and was not a surprise. In the two days she is traveling, my boyfriend begins to transition from happy new father to protective new father. It is a difference but he is very confident in his new role and feels that his life has changed and he is very happy. My mother arrives at 8AM on a Monday and proceeds to say hi to us (although quite exhausted) and goes to sit on our porch to decompress after 48 hours of travel. My boyfriend comes to me and says that she was disrespectful when she arrived. I question him and say, I’m pretty sure she’s just tired, let’s let her rest and then we can all have a conversation about boundaries and more once she’s rested. He agreed and moved on with the morning. I didn’t think anything else of it. At around 9:30AM (90 minutes after her arrival), she passes him in the kitchen and he raises his voice and exclaims to her about how she “will not be disrespectful of him in his house” and more. I begin to bawl and beg him to stop. My mother (completely taken back) goes outside crying. My boyfriend is livid, I can see it in his eyes. I try to calm him down and go to check on my mother, who I then try to calm down. He comes outside and asks to speak to her and I leave them alone (hindsight, should not have done this) and after about 1 minute, my mom comes back inside yelling and crying  “I’m done, I’m done” and tells me she is going to go back home. I try to speak to both of them but I can’t stop crying (had a baby 10 days ago at this point). My mother packs up to leave and does. 

My boyfriend thinks he has done the right thing and protected his family unit. I am devastated that my mom is gone as I wanted her help and guidance with the newborn. He is confident in his decision. In the next two days this confidence does not wane, and he says he “had to hurt me in this situation to maintain his family.” 

We went to bed around 11. We had argued some earlier in the evening but when bedtime rolled around we were actually on good terms and I went to sleep pretty hard because of that. I wake up to a stranger shouting my name, and I look over and the baby is not in his bed. I run out and a policeman is inside. The shower is running. The door is open. The policeman informs me that my boyfriend took the baby and ran out of our apartment building and to a house up the street and rang their doorbell. The officer asked me to come with him and he took me to the house where my boyfriend went. There were many officers outside asking me questions about different things. The consensus was that my boyfriend thought someone was going to kill him so he took the baby and ran. The officers took me inside the house, gave me the baby and then let me know they were taking my boyfriend to the hospital for an evaluation. The officers took me to a hotel for safety. 

The hospital ruled the case a “mental break” and that he was fine. He seemed fine when I picked him up and we went home. As the day went on he got more and more paranoid, so I called the police when he went to work. He insisted that I had bugged the apartment, that the neighbors were in on it, that my mom called our pediatrician, and more. The police suggested for us to separate for the evening and he stayed home and the baby and I are in a hotel again. 

What should I do now? He is continually paranoid now. I have a baby to protect. I don’t feel he is being rational in our home. Please help. Thank you for reading this.

ETA: Overwhelming response, I did not expect this.  The baby and I are safe. I called his mother who is now traveling to come get him. I called my sister who is planning to come now once he is gone from the house so she and I can go back together. Thank you all. This has been the worst week after the best week and I am exhausted. I turned to reddit to rationalize what I was thinking since I don’t have people to talk to outside of the situation. Thank you for the responses.

UPDATE: Updating here - 2 months later. Baby and I are safe and bf has been getting help at his moms. I went to my moms. I’ve been communicating with his mom and he seems to be improving from her perspective. Thank you all again for the messages and the comments - it helped to have outside perspective when I was overwhelmed. I’m much better now then I was then."
fbyqvq,My (20F) boyfriend (24M) feels emasculated by me masturbating after sex.,18052,0.91,2010,2020-03-02 00:32:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fbyqvq/my_20f_boyfriend_24m_feels_emasculated_by_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fbyqvq/my_20f_boyfriend_24m_feels_emasculated_by_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Using a throwaway because my boyfriend occasionally browses reddit. 

The title says it all. Someone masturbating after sex sounds rude, and I'd agree. But he's never given me an orgasm yet, he stops when I'm pretty close. 

For him his own orgasm means sexy time is over. And I get that, I'm usually exhausted after one. But he doesn't seem very interested in making sure I get there before he stops. 

If this was one time, or a couple, I'd totally get it. It takes me longer to finish than him. But it's been every single time. 

I told him I've never had one with him, and that I'd appreciate it if he got me very close during foreplay I might have one at roughly the same time as him, but it hasn't happened yet. To him sex seems to be all about penetration. (Sidenote, I told him I used to masturbate with a pillow, he was very confused as how a pillow would fit inside of me. He doesn't understand the clitoris. I'm trying to educate him but he's still pretty convinced penetration by a penis is how girls orgasm, period.) 

That was three weeks ago. I don't have a very high sex drive, but I can't go to sleep either when I'm pretty close. So I'll move to the living room and finish there. He's told me that that makes him feel like less of a man and asked if I'd stop. 

I've told and shown him what I like and how I can get off. I've told him what we're doing now isn't getting me off. But he doesn't seem to get it. Is there any way I can help him understand? WIBTA for continuing to do it after he said he doesn't like it?

Edit: Thanks everyone for replying. It's almost midnight so I'm going to bed, I'll rethink the relationship in the morning.

Edit 2: I touch myself during, but I take longer than he does. I don't think he's the type to be okay with bringing in toys either. I'm not his first. He is my first.

Edit 3: He doesn't go down on me, since I won't go down on him (past trauma.)

Edit 4: I broke up with him."

Actual things he has said to me

1. (A day after I gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - [*disgusted tone and expression*] ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" By the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""It's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""Your thighs are huge. When you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""It's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. It's very noticeable from behind. I'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""I'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
Who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. He even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""Who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""Who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""Who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""Why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? You keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. So maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""Short and fat isn't a good combination""

And so on. On average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. I've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. It's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom."

I am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because I know they don’t look normal. I just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

I mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn’t want a girl with “fake boobs”. he won’t even listen to me when I tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

I 100% plan on going through with the surgery. I told my doctor up front that I did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in April, the day before mine & my bf’s anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i’m doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR: I have tuberous breasts & the only way to correct it is surgery. my bf completely shot down the idea bc he doesn’t want to date a girl with fake boobs."

I am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 16 I slep with my good friend Jared . The condom broke and my daughter was created. My parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. I couldn't bring it over myself to. I wanted to keep the baby. Ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. So I did. I went to my friends house and his parents took me in. They weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

In that time my friend and I started to develop feelings for each other.

I had my daughter and about 2 moths later Jared's  brother  came back into their life's. He was a recovering Heroin addict. As we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
Eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. My parents got wind of that. They dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my MIL also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

So they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. It was a dark time I thought they were going to take my baby. In the end they didn't find anything substantial.

But them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. As it was a small town every mistake I made got back to my parents.

I was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? Cps charges because neglect.
I was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . Cps.

Christmas loads of people stayed at Jared's house because it was a big family. Cps because many strange men were there.

They eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. If they had done it more I think it could have been an offence.

The last call was 5 years ago.

Eventually Jared and I married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. We worked retail jobs and studied. It took us longer than average to graduate but we did. With a lot of help of his parents. Jared is now an engineer and I work as a graphic designer.

We were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. Our life's look normal now.

Anyway a week ago I get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

I don't really know what to do. Because while they didn't have to take care of my while I was pregnant I wished they had at least supported me. And while I get that they were panicking because they thought I was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years."

TLDR: My girlfriend was really close with my roommate, I suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

Basically, after I kicked my gf out of our party, I assumed we would all lay low for a few days. I was wrong. The day after the party, my roommate (I decided to call him Chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but I ignored him. Less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing Chet couldn't have been avoided, because while I was a good boyfriend, I study and sleep too much. Ok. She then told me she would be willing to work through this if I was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. I didn't respond to the text.

That night I had a dinner with my parents I couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. I came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. I figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. Wrong. I noticed later when Chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into HIS room.

I haven't seen either of them, I think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. I don't even know how to feel. Honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and I'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. "

[Update Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn1oda/update_i_25f_am_so_tired_of_being_psychoanalyzed/)

Background: A little over a year ago, when we first started dating, my boyfriend said something to the effect of ""I'm really good at noticing things about people that they can't - or won't - acknowledge themselves."" I shrugged it off because whatever. And he's a great boyfriend; we're perfectly happy otherwise. But it's started to become a problem.

The issue: My boyfriend has been psychoanalyzing me with increasing frequency, and I'm losing my mind. He'll assume he knows why I'm feeling a certain way or doing a certain thing, and he tends to treat it like a ""Gotcha!"" situation. Telling him that he's wrong is impossible.

For example. We recently watched the new Invisible Man movie together. For those who haven't seen it, the major plot point is that the main character is being tormented by an unseen force, and no one believes her. There's this awesome moment of vindication when everyone finally realizes that she was telling the truth, but then they turn around and doubt her about one small detail. As we were watching, I said something to the effect of, ""Wow, that's really obnoxious. She turned out to be right about the first thing - why would they doubt her about this?"" My boyfriend paused the movie, looked at me like a parent who's comforting a five-year-old who's just fallen off a bike, and said, ""Are you frustrated because you can relate? Has there been a time when no one believed you?"" I pointed out that the movie was *meant* to frustrate the audience and that my feelings weren't that deep, but he got all ""Sure, Jan,"" so I let it drop.

When we first started dating, these remarks didn't bother me. I thought it was sweet, it seemed like he was using these questions as an opportunity to get to know me. But now it just feels very patronizing, like he's constantly trying to suggest that I'm burdened by some deep trauma. Another example - we were watching some random thing on Netflix last night, and he stepped out for a moment. When he came back in, he tackled me (not in a particularly aggressive way, he's just an avid cuddler). I expressed annoyance (I said ""Was that necessary?"") because I'm covered in bruises and road rash from a recent accident, and he'd hurt me (plus, I was eating something and he knocked it to the floor). He sighed and said, ""You're just upset because the girl in the movie is getting bullied, you don't have to take it out on me.""

It finally came to a head today. We were walking to the store, and I was telling a funny story about my siblings watching Phineas and Ferb. I asked if he'd seen it, to which he responded, ""No, I stopped watching kid shows when I was 12."" I replied that I did, too, but that I have younger siblings and so I know the premise. He stopped walking and asked in a weird therapist tone, ""Do you like kid shows? Is this a form of regression? Is that why you play Pokemon?"" I calmly responded that I was starting to get frustrated, and asked him to please stop. He put his arm around me comfortingly and, in the same tone, said, ""I'm done, I'm done, it's okay."" I pointed out that he wasn't stopping, but he just kept using the same tone to say it was okay. I ended up shaking his arm off of me, turning around, and walking back home without him.

He came home and insisted that he's just messing around, and he said he's just referencing the study module that we're in (FTR, we're both in medical school and we've just finished our psychiatry rotation). But he's done this for over a year now, and it feels very belittling. I'm older than him, just as intelligent as he is, and I've also brought this up before. He knows I hate it. But whenever I express annoyance, he kinda takes on the attitude of ""Yeah, I know it's uncomfortable to realize hard things about yourself sometimes."" **(Edit: I’ve seen some confusion here and on other social media platforms where this has been reposted - hi Twitter. We are medical students. We had to do a compulsory 6-week mental health rotation.

HOWEVER. I know he's not doing it to be nefarious. It doesn't happen THAT frequently, just more now that we spend our time at home together. And also I'm a little hormonal. And we really are genuinely happy in every other regard. So I need to know. What do I do from here?

**Tl;dr - My boyfriend talks to me like he's my therapist and tries to unpack benign comments and emotions; he doesn't believe me when I tell him he's wrong. I think it's annoying, he thinks I need to get over it. What do I do?**

We were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, I was dozing off and then she randomly said “your love for me is unconditional right?” And I mean I say that all the time so I didn’t think much of it and I said “yes, I will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers” and it was clearly a joke. She kisses me but then says “ so if I turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?” .... I was confused because it was such a random question and I laughed and just said “I don’t know about that, I’d love you as a pet I guess”

She sits up and says “are you fucking serious?!” at this point I’m completely lost. I just sat there and she says “as a pet... that’s it?” I said “I mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?...” she says “still love me like you just claimed that you did, it’s funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey I would still love you unconditionally and I would not treat you like ‘a pet’” .... I had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. I just said “ if you were a donkey how else was I supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? Am I supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??” She says “I’m not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!” ... I just stopped talking because I didn’t want to say anything else wrong. 

I’m just confused. She was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. What did I say? I have no idea what exactly she was upset about. Am I not looking into this deep enough? I’m genuinely confused as to what I did and how to fix it. I don’t want to say something and make it worse. "
in04pl,My [27/F] STBXH [37/M] forced me into an open marriage and is now telling everyone I cheated on him.

I didn’t want a divorce, so I agreed to an open marriage.

The next year was awful, he would flaunt all of the girls he was sleeping with in front of me, he would even bring them to our apartment to sleep with them whilst I was home, he even slept with my now ex best friend (Jane) and tried to have a threesome with us. When I tried to voice my concerns, he dismissed them and said I had my chance to set rules when we first had the discussion (the only ‘rule’ we had was we had to use protection) and I couldn’t complain now.

After that first year, I ended up confiding in my friend Anna \[27\]. Anna and I have been friends since high school, but she never liked my husband, so we drifted after I got married. When I told her, what was happening she insisted I go back to work (my husband made me quit my job when we got married despite the fact I had a higher earning potential than him and we’ve struggled with money since). She ended up connecting me with her brother Leo \[30\] who is the owner of a company in the field I was planning to pursue my career in. After an informal interview he offered me a job. My husband wasn’t happy and kept insisting I quit. He even offered to close our marriage if I would just quit but I didn’t want to be dependent on him again, so I refused. He even threatened divorce but by this point I was checked out of the relationship, so I didn’t care.

About eight months later, Anna offered to let me move in with her since her roommate was moving out. I took her up on the offer and filed for divorce. Her and Leo helped me move my stuff out when my husband was at work.

My husband has now been telling family and friends that I was having an affair with Leo this whole time. I wasn’t but most people believe him. Most of my friends are insisting I go back to my husband and have made comments about how I was trying to social climb by sleeping with Leo. They have been giving me a lot of lectures about how money isn’t everything and sometimes you find a good man who loves you and you shouldn’t throw him away just because someone else can offer you more materialistic stuff.

Jane in particular is very vocal about what a s\*\*\* I am. Just for context, she used to like Leo back in high school, but he rejected her multiple times, so I think she’s being especially vicious because she thinks something is really going on between us.

I don’t have any written proof about this whole open marriage fiasco so I can’t show them that. Is there any other way I can convince them I wasn’t sleeping around? How can I stop letting the rumours he’s spreading affect me?

TL;DR – My husband forced me into opening our marriage. After he disrespected me so much in a year, finally decided to file for divorce. He’s now telling everyone I was cheating on him with my new boss who is also the brother of one of my friends."

Okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. I'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

A friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. She had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do I even really know the full story yet. She is not really the prank playing type and I guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

It looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. After I started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. Well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. I guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

Anyway, I texted her and I told her that I knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. She started blowing my phone up apologizing. She said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. She also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that I was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

I just didn't really respond to her. I left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. My family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. Our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. I'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. I'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as I'm awake with this Jameson. 

tl;dr: This was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee."
csw8po,My [F28] MIL won't take my kid's [4] anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously,17785,0.95,2004,2019-08-20 15:49:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csw8po/my_f28_mil_wont_take_my_kids_4_anaphylactic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csw8po/my_f28_mil_wont_take_my_kids_4_anaphylactic/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"**UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF POST.**

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Sorry for mobile formatting. I've never really seen eye-to-eye with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son. I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let it go, so I've tried to. 

Until now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

Now my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly. 

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

I'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I worry too much. 

Would it be awful if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**EDIT/MINI-UPDATE**: First of all, woah. I did not expect this to get so much attention. Thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. In case you missed it: I'VE LEFT FOR NOW, removed my son from the situation, and I'm now currently staying at my brother's house. At least for a few days until things cool off and I'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. In the mean time, I've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). Unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. My husband has been to the same appointments I have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

Some people have accused me of being a helicopter Mom, or trying to demonize my MIL. And given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe I'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then I'm okay. I'm not even a SAHM, we have an incredible nanny while I work FT, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. In the past, I've tried my best for my MIL to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, I've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. But I'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

Lastly, I just want to say my MIL has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. She won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. So, I don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. She's very strong in her beliefs. I did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. My husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so I told him to find time or he won't be getting ANY time with my son until he does. If he's going to be so careless, I'll end up dealing with this legally. 

Thanks again everyone. Words can't express my gratitude. I will update with a new thread eventually."
gn1oda,[UPDATE] I (25F) am so tired of being psychoanalyzed by my boyfriend (24M),17773,0.94,444,2020-05-20 06:42:43,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn1oda/update_i_25f_am_so_tired_of_being_psychoanalyzed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn1oda/update_i_25f_am_so_tired_of_being_psychoanalyzed/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gkvb89/i_25f_am_so_tired_of_being_psychoanalyzed_by_my/?sort=new)

Long update ahead. Sorry for the delay! It was tricky to coordinate schedules in a way that allowed us to sit down and give the conversation the time it deserved. And I know this might be disappointing for a lot of you who were hoping for a sassy #MicDrop moment, but our conversation was really level-headed.

Basically, I summarized my OP and emphasized how it's annoying that he turns my benign comments into deep, introspective interrogations - but more than that, it's incredibly frustrating and inappropriate for him to tell me how I'm feeling/why I'm feeling that way. I raised some of the points/questions that everyone recommended, and even said at one point, ""It seems like it's really important to you that I feel a certain way about things or identify with something you're saying, to the point where you refuse to accept that I might not actually feel that way. Why do you think that is?""

After apologizing profusely, he talked about how he, like so many of us, was in a relationship where his partner never really said what she was thinking, and she expected him to read her mind. She'd lie about how she was feeling, and then punish him for taking her comments at face value. We talked about why this was wasn't great behavior on her part, and I now understand where his habit comes from, but I was clear about how I'm **not** his ex, and I've never been dishonest about how I feel or what my expectations are. I empathize with him, but I also told him that this is a problem on **his** end, and while I'm happy to work through those fears/feelings with him, I will not be punished for her shortcomings. (I also ended up throwing in a snarky comment about how psychiatrists call this *displacement* \- redirecting his emotions to a neutral party; he took this with good humor and a ""Point taken""). 

We talked about his comment from when we first got together (where he said he's good at realizing things about people that they can't or won't acknowledge), and he's embarrassed at how obnoxious it was. He admitted that he can actually have a difficult time reading others' emotions, so he tries to overcompensate. He said he sometimes suspects he might have autism (which some of you suggested!), and we talked about how it's 10000% okay for him to say ""I'm having a hard time reading you right now - what are you feeling?"" instead of just assuming he knows.

We talked about the Netflix-cuddle incident. From his side, he came in for a snuggle because he thought I was sad about the movie, so when I asked ""Was that necessary?"", he thought I was asking about the cuddle itself (and not the food loss/pain of being tackled), so he said, ""But you're upset because the girl is being bullied,"" and confused about my annoyed tone, he added, ""You don't have to take it out on me."" He didn't recognize that he'd hurt me (again, he was horrified and apologetic about this). And when it comes to the Phineas and Ferb/Pokemon thing, he fully admits that he was being a complete, patronizing asshole without reason. He said he's probably *projecting* (ha!), and promised to raise it with his therapist.

One last thing I want to address: I know some of you seem to think that he's The Devil and is always a horrible boyfriend and is going to be a terrible doctor (this is called *splitting* \- believing people are either all good or all bad)^(\*\*This is a joke, pls don't come for me). But that's because I was asking for advice on the one bothersome thing in our relationship. I could have included every awesome thing he does for me/says to me/etc., but my post was already an essay. Please trust that he is an amazing boyfriend, and we take great care of each other.

As far as what kind of doctor he'll be, I understand why some of you have made that leap. But he is absolutely wonderful with patients, listens empathetically, trusts what they tell him, and picks up on things that the average person wouldn't. I've told this story elsewhere, but I'll tell it here too - we once had the same patient for a long case presentation. She'd had a stroke, so I talked about which artery was likely occluded based on her symptoms, clinical mumbo jumbo, thought I was clever for recognizing that she was unrelatedly overdue for a mammogram, and included ""X medication, occupational therapy review"" as part of my plan. His report was totally different - he hit the important clinical aspects, but spent much more time than I had talking about the difficulties she'd face at home due to her impaired mobility (he even listed the locations and numbers of stairs in each room in her house). His plan had ""X medication, occupational therapy review, and talk to charge nurse about scheduling Y conference room for visitors so she doesn't have to miss bridge club."" I think he'll be fine.

Thank you all so much for your awesome messages and advice! It was so helpful. Onwards and upwards!"

First of all I'd like to thank every single person who commented and gave their condolences for Alf. I read every single one and I would've loved to reply individually but there were so many I wouldn't be able to. But you have my sincere thanks for you kind words and they have helped me through a tough time.

So onto the update: BF realised he fucked up the next day. I'd blocked his number but on my phone you can see when blocked numbers try to call you, it just auto-rejects. Since that night he's called me around 15 times a day from 9am-midnight. He probably sent texts but they don't show up. I forgot to block him on Instagram so I got a few messages on their before I blocked but basically they said, ""come on talk to me"", ""answer your phone"" and ""don't ignore me"". No apologies, not empathy, just me me me.

In hindsight he'd been doing this a lot. I read through a lot of past communication and I saw it with new eyes...he was constantly disregarding my feelings and taking about how bad his life is and how I should feel sorry for him and how he's being good to me regardless. He's a nasty, selfish person and I was so used to his behaviour I'd normalised it and was worried I was being insensitive to his feelings after I watched my best friend die.

Without your comments and opinions I probably would've stayed with him for as long as he decided, maybe even had a baby with him (which he'd probably do to claim ""family life"" so he doesn't get deported) and waste more time with him. I want to say thanks to everyone who opened my eyes. And thanks to Alfie for showing me the truth as his final act as a good boy.

TL;DR: You were right, he's mean and selfish and doesn't care about my pain because he doesn't care about me. In death, Alf still has my back.

EDIT 2: Just to clear something up as some people have been frothing at the mouth because they think I quit my job - I didn't. I actually went into work and my manager could see there was something wrong with me and after I told her she told me to take the rest of the day off. I'd accrued a lot of TOIL and she said I could use it for the rest of the week as my diary was pretty free that week and she could tell I needed it. My job is emotionally taxing (I work with looked after children, particularly victims of CSE), so it was best for everyone if I used my TOIL while I was feeling so bad. 

Thanks for all the support everyone. I won't be posting on this account again but hope everyone gives their pup an extra hug tonight"

For some reason I can’t access my original throwaway account but I decided that I should still update you guys.

I ended up leaving my bf because if I got to 70-80lbs I would likely die since I’m already starting to feel really bad from my weight. I’m going to quit my daily jogs for awhile and only do it once a week. I have also decided to give up starving myself and eat more then salads so I can gain weight again hopefully I can get back to 130lbs as that’s when I felt healthy.

Thanks for all of the kind comments on my last post as it really helped make this decision.

Edit:even at 130lbs I wasn’t over weight according to my doctor"
hv5tgx,My brother (36) sexually abused my daughter (now 19) when she was a child.

To say that I’m feeling sick, full of guilt and heartbroken is an understatement. I’ve always been so close with my brother and I never thought he would be capable of doing this. 
 
I stand by my daughter 100%. I’m making sure she knows this. I no longer have a relationship with my brother, and it hurts, but I know it’s the right thing to do. My daughter doesn’t want to press charges. (Should I still encourage her to?)

After telling my parents about this, I come to find out my mom already knew about this years ago when my brother confided in her. According to her, my brother is remorseful and she has already forgiven him. It makes me so angry that she knew and did nothing. In my eyes, she failed me, my daughter, and her other grandchildren. 

Here is the part where this gets confusing for me. I don’t know how to proceed with this. It breaks my heart that my mom is defending a child abuser. On the other hand, I love my mom and it hurts to think about possibly cutting her out of my life. 

Is it wrong of me to still want to maintain a relationship with my mother and still be supportive of my daughter?

Update/Edit: I greatly appreciate all the comments, seriously thank you. I’ve decided to cut my mother out of my life. Unfortunately, that means my dad too, since he’s supporting her decision. As painful as it is, my daughter comes first. I’ve warned all of family with kids about my brother. I truly hope no one else was hurt. 

Fortunately, my daughters mother (my ex wife) and her side of the family have all been incredibly supportive. 

Thank you to everyone who suggested therapy - my daughter started going this week. I will look into it for myself, as well."

I told my sister all of this and she said that he’s lying and I have to break up with him. I told her I wouldn’t and she said that if I ever want to talk to her again I’ll break up with him.

Thank you to everybody for your advice. I actually wrote this post yesterday but it was too soon to post an update. There are a lot of people calling my girlfriend a 'future bridezilla', and while my post may have made her seem demanding, I'd just like to clarify that she really is my best friend and a great person. There's no chance of us breaking up.

Saying that, after thinking a lot about the responses I received, I decided to sit my girlfriend down and draw a line in the sand. I told her that after 4 proposals, I'm lost and confused as to what she wants, and if she has a 'dream proposal' in mind she had to tell me exactly what she wants so I could make this work.

My girlfriend looked somewhat nervous at that so I pushed her to communicate properly. She apologised again for not accepting my proposals earlier, but said that in 2019 she was still testing out our relationship and so when I asked her to marry me, she said 'try again' rather than yes in the hope that I'd wait longer. From her perspective, while she had responded positively to the idea of marriage prior to this, it had still been too soon for real engagement. I will admit that I'm not the best at reading social subtext if it's not stated directly so I could have missed the implication when she asked for a different proposal.

When I later asked her in February, she knew I was the one but was telling the truth about being too anxious to consider marriage.

She actually confessed that she's planning on proposing to ME later this year, sometime around when we were planning to fly to my home country. She had been trying to keep it a surprise, but we've now agreed that it's better we're both on the same page when it comes to proposing. We've decided that we're both going to sit down and work together to make the proposal special for both of us.

TL;DR: I sat my GF down to talk and we're going to work this out together. We're still not engaged but it's something in both of our futures."
d36bvg,My wife is done with sex and Im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?,17560,0.95,2821,2019-09-12 16:42:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d36bvg/my_wife_is_done_with_sex_and_im_not_ready_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d36bvg/my_wife_is_done_with_sex_and_im_not_ready_to_be/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. She swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

We have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. No matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

Essentially...
- if I try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if I am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

Recently Ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but Im dying inside.

Is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? Or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? I dont want an affair etc, I want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

dwwpsc,"The guy (29m) I'm (25f) dating and his friends ""gatekeeped"" me about my hobbies and career, I'm feeling embarrassed.",17540,0.93,2481,2019-11-16 02:20:42,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dwwpsc/the_guy_29m_im_25f_dating_and_his_friends/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dwwpsc/the_guy_29m_im_25f_dating_and_his_friends/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I need some help processing this. They made me question whether or not I'm actually authentic when it comes to what I'm interested in. I feel like I don't want to talk about my interests with anyone because I don't want to be pop quizzed. 


The person I'm dating (together 3 months), I'll call him 'Dan', recently invited me out to dinner to meet some of his coworkers. The first red flag was he invited everyone out to a Hooters, and said they chose that restaurant because it's close to where they work and is easy to get to. Which is true, but there are several other restaurants near by that offer better food and a better atmosphere. 


Before he invited me out to dinner, he half joked that his coworkers (all of them are male) didn't believe that he was dating a ""hot girl"" that's into the same hobbies as them. (The are hobbies that are considered to be primarily for men.) I was a little irked at that comment, but he said he was ""just joking around"" (this pretty much became the catch phrase for the men that night). When everyone arrived at the restaurant Dan and his coworkers were making comments about the girls that worked there and their physical appearances. This made me a little uncomfortable but I didn't say anything. 


Once everyone ordered their food/drink his friends started to quiz me about my interests. Many of them share the same ""male dominated"" hobbies I'm interested in, and they more or less just tried to see if I knew facts about the hobby, as opposed to asking me questions about what I like/don't like or what I'm currently doing in said hobby. For example, if my hobby was American history - one of them would ask an esoteric question like ""Oh, so you like American History? How many one dollar bills are currently in circulation? How old is the French Broad River!?"" 


I also work as a junior automation engineer at a start up software company. I haven't been writing code that long, as I was working in QA prior and learned how to code while I was in that position. I'm really green and I know I still have a lot to learn. The projects I'm working on are small and I'm getting help at work. All of his friends are senior level software engineers and were quizzing me about my work and trying to see how much I actually know. They were asking about advanced things I did not know about, and were asking me technical questions that don't even apply to my job. But, they were all smiling and laughing, and would frequently say something like ""aw we're just kidding!"" 


At one point I felt like I was at some weird interview and was taking one question at a time from each d-bag at the table. I know I stopped fake smiling at some point and just emotionlessly answered their questions. I think one of them became self aware because he just looked down at his phone for the rest of the evening, didn't ask me anything else and just looked uncomfortable. 


When they weren't asking pointed questions at me, they were talking to each other and ignoring me. I'd be interrupted if I tried to include my thoughts on the subject, or nod at me and look away to someone else. 


I should mention all of these guys were 5-10 years older than me, I'm 25, the guy I'm dating is 29, and his coworkers are in their early-mid 30s. I don't have as much experience as they do, part of me was hoping I could meet peers who could have helped guide me or answer my questions about their careers. Instead, one of them literally asked me to give him a sql query. They all kept saying they were just kidding around or just joking and laughing about it, but it was so cringey. 


Dan was sitting beside me and wasn't stopping this behavior from his coworkers. He was coaching me, I guess? Saying things like ""oh! you know this one!"" or ""come on you got this, we talked about this last week!"" Dan also made the comment of ""See, she's really smart too!"" to one of the guys at the table. 


That whole night was just awful. He was actually irritated at me because he saw my whole mood change while I was being quizzed by his friends. He said he noticed me having an ""attitude"" with his coworkers, when they were just having fun and trying to get to know me. That it was immature of me to have been to obviously annoyed and that I ""audibly sighed"" multiple times when one his friends spoke to me. 


I can't stop seeing Dan as a super cringey dude now. I thought he was acting ridiculous and seemed more like a 13 year old boy as opposed to someone who is supposed to be turning 30 in a couple of months. I'm pretty sure I can't go on with the relationship at this point. I don't think this is an overreaction on my part, if I were to break up with him. 


Is it within reason to end a relationship after this event? Everything was going fine before this happened. But now I just feel gross. The dinner happened last night and I haven't returned any of his texts today. I know ghosting is wrong, but I don't want to look at him or speak to him, the thought of him just kind of disgusts me at this point. I've never felt like someone's show poodle before. I don't know if I'll feel differently in a week or if I'm unjustified in my anger. 


tl;dr: Went out with bf and his friends. They gatekeeped me about my hobbies and careers all night. Dan encouraged this behavior. I acted as unenthusiastic show poodle and unceremoniously answered their stupid questions. Dan is mad at me for not playing along and having a bad attitude.

b6fd8u,My [22f] boyfriend’s [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,17517,0.97,1295,2019-03-28 11:59:47,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

I don’t really know how to begin so I’m just gonna dive right in. We’ve been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he’s planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

Last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. This took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. He talked about getting his brother’s name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. Cool, I thought. That all sounds beautiful. 

We didn’t really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. It was on a day I was working so I couldn’t go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

I did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good. It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

It’s been a few sessions now and he’s had the whole shebang done to it. Colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. I can’t deny that it’s a seriously incredible piece of artwork. Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it’s pretty cool as well. 

My only issue with it is during sex. 

It takes up such a large space on his chest and it’s the only tattoo he’s got. It doesn’t help that he’s pretty pale and doesn’t have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu*cken Lisa. 

Any position that we’re facing each other in, I always end up making eye contact with it. And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. Every time. Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old. 

It’s honestly ruining our sex life. 

I haven’t told my bf any of this because I feel like I can’t say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it’s permanent. (I know lasers exist but I doubt he’ll ever get rid of it) 

Lately we’ve mainly been having sex in positions where I’m facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he’s started to notice this and has told me he’s worried I’m not attracted to him anymore.

I am attracted to him. I’m just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

What can I do in this situation? The thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

Should I talk to him? Am I overreacting? Is our sex life officially dead? 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and I can’t stop making eye contact with it during sex. 


———————————————————

Update: This has gotten a lot more attention than I anticipated. Some people are saying it’s reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. I’m not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. Currently debating whether I should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

Otherwise I’ve received some really phenomenal advice on how I should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. I was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before I made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. So thank you so much. 

I’ll make a new post to update how things go once I’ve talked to my bf about all this. If he doesn’t see this post first I think I’ll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

&#x200B;

I know this is a non traditional thing to need advice on but people I know irl recommended I at least try, if there's a better suited forum let me know.

My husband and I have been together for nearly 4 years and married for two and a half. We have a one year old son (via surrogacy). Three months ago there was an accident (I'm putting this delicately, you may fill in the blanks) that he survived, but left him severely brain damaged. I was told that if he woke up he wouldn't be the same and would be severely disabled.

Perhaps it was selfish of me but I opted to try medical intervention as much as possible. I wasn't, nor am I now, prepared to say goodbye to him.

Recent scans have shown that he has no brain activity left, the only thing keeping him alive now (""alive"", since there's no real brain activity that would qualify a person as being alive) is the machines. I understand there's no coming back from it, but emotionally, I don't know how to let go. I feel like there's so many things we still have left to do, so many things I want to tell him and don't know how, and I don't know how to get closure enough to allow myself to say that it's okay to let him go.

I know that it will mean that his pain, mentally and physically, are over, but how do I get closure? How do you prepare for and accept the inevitability of impending death? What ways can I try to get closure before it happens?"

&#x200B;

I'm sure people would like an update and a somewhat of a conclusion to this hurdle in my life, but here's what happened.

I read everyone's advice, and a lot of it was very helpful, while others, not so much, some going as far as to consider murder, yeah, not on the table. But for those that did offer genuine advice, thank you. After getting the same result with the second paternity test, I talked to ""Sarah"", and a lot emotions rolled out, how could and old friend betray me, I wasn't sure if it was or wasn't yours, I'm sorry, how could you not trust me, she was all over the place.

After she calmed down I got a few more answers out of her, turns out it wasn't one guy she was sleeping with, rather a total of three, and they wore protection too, but someone got unlucky and knocked her up. At this point, I should've been furious, but somehow, that didn't happen, I had grown numb to the whole situation. So yeah, I decided I don't want to go through with this marriage and put everything on hold, I plan to eventually cancel everything. I called my parents and explained what was going on, they were shocked; then her parents, same reaction, I was surprised with how understanding there were to the whole situation, like I said, they're great people, their reaction only reinforce this.

Luckily, the wedding was within driving distance from all attendees, 8 hours being the longest drive, the amount of fallout was minimal, apart from my and her parents, no one else knows what's really going on other than the wedding is delayed.

Regarding my ""daughter"", I've come to terms that she's not mine, and any feelings I have towards her we're built on a lie, it's not too late to start over, she's still young (1yr), she won't remember me. As painful as it is, I can't see my life continuing with her.

So to wrap things up, I've moved out for the time being to have so space, my parents said I could stay with them until I can sort things out, waiting on the results of an STD test, should be coming in tomorrow, I've talked to a lawyer and she's said it's a pretty messy situation, but if we can find out who the father is, it could very much help my case. I don't know any of the possible fathers, but her ""friend"" instantly knew two of the names, as for the third she wasn't sure, but knew someone who might.

So this is where I am, still not sure where things will go and what will happen, but I can only hope for the best, life sometimes takes a dump on you, but you don't realize it till one person spills the beans.

Thanks reddit for the help. I wish I could tell you I'm looking forward to a happy ending, but it's too soon to be sure of anything."

The first partner I had was when I was 18 years old and fresh out of high school and his name was James. It was a casual relationship in the sense that both of us were just enjoying that transient stage of life where you travel, work a bunch of random jobs, meet new people & let go of old ones; but it was a serious relationship in terms of the way we felt about each other. We adored each other and never really got sick of each other, neither of us had any future plans but we just didn’t care because we felt like we could tackle anything together and both of us were independent spirits in a way too. Unfortunately a year and a half into our relationship James was in a car accident (not his driving that caused it) and didn’t make it. That was an awful time in my life that broke me apart but with support from friends and family as well as James’ family, I managed to continue moving forwards in life.

A couple of years later and I’m 21, I meet Hamish. He knew pretty early on what I had been through and was an absolute gem about everything. He was in his late 20s and had kind of secured his place in the world already and in a way he kind of anchored me; something I didn’t know how much I needed and wanted til it did. We made a partnership and after about 8 months together I moved in with him. He had his own house and a steady job already, and I had just started my degree so I played homemaker a lot of the time (did contribute with a part time job too) and things really fell into place naturally. I had finally began to trust that I could be happy again when I got a call from his worksite that he had been injured at work and was enroute to hospital. Unfortunately he sustained a serious head injury and didn’t regain consciousness. His family (who I had only met a couple of times) pulled him off life support a week later and that was that. I fell into a much deeper depressive hole this time round. It didn’t help that I also lost the home I had with him since we were not married at his time of death so in a blur of grief and depression I was also packing boxes and had to move back in with family because I couldn’t afford a rental on my own. I dropped out of college and tried to figure out some semblance of normal. Again.

At 24, about 10 months after Hamish’s passing, I meet Adam at a community event. We hit it off but I was definitely not looking for a partner at that point in time so we were friends for a few months and spent a lot of time doing activities together, volunteering together and just being in each other’s company. He introduced me to his wide circle of friends which really helped me out because after Hamish passed, a lot of my old ones had not stuck around. Adam and I reached boiling point on a group camping trip and ended up sharing a tent and confessing feelings. He understood my hesitation to take things further and basically said he could be whatever I needed him to be at that point in time. As time goes on, we go on more dates and get more intimate and I eventually realise we are well and truly in a relationship. I struggled a lot with ‘waiting for the other shoe to drop’ and just as I was letting go of that feeling— the worst happened and Adam was killed very suddenly. At this point I basically had a nervous breakdown and did spend some time in an inpatient facility because of my inability to cope with the situation at hand. I didn’t know how it was all happening again.

Fast forward two years to 27. I graduated my degree after many years of part-time study. I’m living independently, finally. I’m going to therapy regularly, I’m trying to live life just one day at a time. I am not looking for any kind of relationship, because frankly I am too petrified to. I have a small but close group of friends who have supported me through the worst and the best times in my life (and I them). And after landing a graduate position in my field— I meet Joel. A Sweet, kind, funny, adoring 39 year old. Everything you could want in a partner. We both go back and forth for a while but about 6 months after meeting we begin dating. And about 6 months after we start dating, he gets diagnosed with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. As you already know from the title of my post, unfortunately his treatment plan failed and I lost Joel only a little over a year after meeting him.

I am not generally a superstitious person but at this point I feel as though there is a curse on me, that I am undateable. I can’t imagine ever wanting to date another man again, because what if by doing so I am condemning him to death? When I expressed those fears to Joel, he understood and it was one reason why it took some time for us to be together. And then look what happened. I still receive therapy regularly, but therapy only goes so far and I feel like I need some true advice. The other main thing I struggle with is the way people in my town look at me. It is a midsized regional city, some people were at all four funerals to give you some idea of the size of the town even though none of my late partners knew each other. Everyone knows OF everyone here, and people stare at me as though I’m poisonous, or guilty of something. I wonder all the time about whether I should leave town and move somewhere fresh— I know that doesn’t solve all my problems but I feel like at least the people wouldn’t have preconceived notions of me & should I ever date again that men won’t recoil from me. I feel totally lost and I am not sure how my twenties has been stolen by so much grief and heartache and how I became a magnet for death. I feel about 40 years older than any other 28 year old.

TL;DR: I have been a magnet for death and have lost four boyfriends. I feel like a cursed object and am unsure whether moving will help me start fresh or just exacerbate my isolation.

EDIT: I never expected this post to get this many responses. The comments along with messages in my DMs has left me incredibly overwhelmed and thankful. I didn't know what to expect when I posted this but some of the words people have offered to me will echo in my head moving forwards in the best way possible. I am going to do my best today to reply to all the comments that helped me. I know many people accused me of faking this post and if you want to think that then I guess that's your prerogative but to clear up a few of the reasons why people think it is a lie:- I didn't go into detail about Adam's passing because there are still some ongoing legal aspects surrounding it and because I am identifiable to some people I didn't want to risk posting anything that could interfere with that process until it is over.

\- A lot of people seem to be up in arms about the name Hamish, forgetting that it's not his real name. He was not foreign, not that it would matter if he was.

\- I don't live in a city city, it's just not the smallest town in the world and I was trying to give an indicator as to the size. When I talk about where i'm from I use the word town or I say 'going into town'.

\- It's also not a college town, I did my degree online.

Hi,

I've never had an account on Reddit before, but someone on another forum linked this subreddit and I've been reading some stories. If this is the wrong subreddit, please let me know. Also english is not my first language, so bear with me.

It's pretty much like the title says. I just feel so lost on what to do. This is tearing up wounds and old rage is building again.

Let me give some backstory.

I've grew up in what was probably the most normal of normal households. Parents worked a lot, but still managed to care for me and my 3 older sisters. We were never super close as a family, but never had any issues either. Same goes for my extended family. They always lived a few hours away, but we saw each other during summer holidays or christmas and always got along great. But when we got older we naturally grew apart as everyone had their own lives.

I'm 31 now. In 2014, when I was 22 and attending Uni, I got a phone call from my mother that turned my life upside down. I remember I didn't even answer at first, because I was gaming with friends. But she called again immidiately after the first call. This was an unwritten rule in the family. If you call twice like that, it's important. Like someone died-important. So when she called again, I excused myself and answered, only to hear chaos in the other end. Like people were arguing. But when my mom realized I had answered, it sounded like she went to another room and closed the door. I just asked what was going on and I heard she was crying. My memory of this conversation is a bit blurry, but she basically asked me if I had something to confess to regarding ""E"".

E is my cousin on my moms side and is 7 years younger than me, 15 at the time. At that point I hadn't even seen E for several years.

I just said no and asked what this is about. She just cried even harder and started accusing me of sxually assaulting E back when we were children. That E had told everything to my sister, and that my sister told my mother and my aunt. E had told them that back when she was 9 (and I 16), she'd been playing in my room when I came in and started feeling her under her clothes and kissing her. My mother screamed at me to say something, but I couldn't even speak. It was all so absurd. I remember thinking that must be some bad joke.

The last thing I remember saying was that it's not true and that E is lying. But then my mom goes on saying that how E gave such a detailed description of where and how. Then she kept asking something like ""did you do this?! did you do this?!"" and I just scream back at her ""no!"" each time. It all ended with my mom putting me on speaker and both my mom and dad saying that they don't want anything to do with me and never to contact them again. Two of my sisters texted me later that day, pretty much saying that I'm disgusting and then blocked me.

I know it's weird, but after that call I went to have a long shower. To this day I still don't know why I did that. After calming down, I started calling and texting everyone, even E. No one answered and the ones who hadn't blocked my number by then quickly did so. The only thing I heard back was from my father who texted me to stop contacting them and that they need to heal.

That was 9 years ago and I haven't spoken to anyone in my family since that day.

To say this f\*cked me up is an understatement. I was living in a haze for weeks after that and hardly ate at all. It didn't help that this was right before I was supposed to defend my bachelors thesis and was already stressed out. Luckily my co-writer sensed something was up and saved me by controlling the conversation so that I got the easy parts. Without him I sure I would've failed. Needless to say, no one came to my graduation.

Then started the worst period of my life. I spent the first year expecting the cops to knock on my door and arresting me for sexual abuse. I didn't land any jobs, just living off my saved money. I drank a lot and did oxy. I also grew resentful and violent. The only reason I didn't hurt anyone is because no one was around. My neighbour called the cops on me once after I had smashed a glass, but I managed to convince the officers that I had just dropped it, and they went away since there were no others inside my apartment. Instead of sleeping, I spent my nights planning how I could hurt E and make sure no one ever found out. Even thinking how I could actually do the things she'd accused me of, but much worse. (I know, I'm not proud of that)

I landed my first ""real"" job in my field in late 2015. Only then did things start to improve. I focused all my time on my job, as it gave me something ""normal"" to do. Recovery was a slow process, but I drank less (sober now for 4+ years) and smiled more. I lived cheap and earned good money, so I made a point of buying myself a nice gift for my birthdays, a VR headset, a motorcycle, Lego etc. And last year I moved from my shitty apartment and bought a small house. It was an old dream of mine to have my own garage and a garden to care for. This has boosted me even more.

So my life is ""OK"" now. I still got problems. I've been on anti-depressants for the last few years and while they help, it's not in a happy way. They simply remove the dark thoughts and replace them with dead ones. My trust in other people is close to non-existent. I've tried dating, but only been on two dates with two different women. It's really hard to speak like a normal person when it comes down to it. And what would I tell a potential partner when she ask about my family? ""Oh you know they accused me of a heinous crime and we're not talking anymore. But I didn't do it, I swear!"" My field is very male dominated, so the only woman I really speak to is my therapist, who I like a lot.

If this text was difficult to follow, I apologize. I'm not good with words on the best of days, and I started rambling a bit when it all came back to me. It's already getting long so I will fast forward to my current issue.

A few days ago, I received a text from my mother. It felt unreal and I was scared to open it at first, so I just stared at the notification for hours before opening it. Yesterday, another text followed. Translated, they basically say:

Text 1:

Hi, <my name>

It's been so long since we talked. We miss you and want to know how you're doing.

<Here she writes a long text about my sisters and how my neices and nephews are getting big. I didn't even know I was an uncle.>

Know that we love you and always will.

\-Mom and dad

Text 2:

Hi, <my name>

We understand if you don't want to talk to us after what happened, but please listen.

Last month, the subject of you was brought up at a family gathering. During this, E was downplaying everything that had happened to her. It got so awkward that she finally admitted that nothing happened and that she probably just dreamt it. We were all appalled by this.

When we last spoke, we wanted to protect E and did the only thing we thought we could do. We know that's not excusing how you were treated.

What E did was wrong and we're all angry at her. We have called everyone that knew and told them the truth.

We all want to speak with you and your sisters want you to meet their families.

Please write back if you can find it in you to forgive us.

\-Mom and dad

So yeah. That's my situation right now. I haven't answered, but they no doubt know I've seen it. Truth be told, I'm seething. Soo many old, shitty memories are now stirring again. I don't want to forgive them and I wouldn't trust myself to be in the same room as them right now. Part of me wants to call my family and unleash everything on them, to guilt them with everything I went through until they all hit their rock bottom. Then dedicate my life to make my cousins life as miserable as possible. The other part wants to ignore them and continue with my OK-ish life with my motorcycle and my garden to keep me company.

I don't have any friends. The only people I speak to are my coworkers, but we're not really close. I've called my therapists clinic, but they told me she's on vacation and won't be available for weeks, and I don't want anyone else than her.

So that leaves internet strangers. So please, where to go from here? Do I ignore them and continue as is?Or do I answer? And if so, what to even write? I'm pretty sure meeting them in person would be a bad idea for a forseeable future, but I'm not even sure how my life can improve from picking up those old threads. As embarrasing at it may sound, I've dreamed about the day when they apologized to be them throwing themselves to the ground and kissing my feet. Texting seems so anticlimactic now.

TL;DR

My cousin falesly accused me of sxual assaulting her when we were minors and I was disowned. Now it has been revealed that it never happened and my family is contacting me and wants to make amends. I don't know how to respond.

&#x200B;

Edit:

holy shit, I went to bed yesterday after answering a couple of comments. I was happy then when someone just said to wait for mt therapist to come back, something that had flown over my head. Now theres 1300 comments. I can't possibly answer all, but I'll try to read all when I get home from work.

I just want to address something I saw a few people mention. That my therapist wouldnt leave for that long without telling me. I don't know how this works in other places. But this is a state run clinic, no hourly rate or anything. I got assigned to her when first going there, which means she will continue to ""get me"" on meetings that follows. But that is not 100%. If she's on leave or sick, I might get someone else. 4-6 weeks of vacation is not uncommon.

[last update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ibccth/update_to_update_my_dads_43_girlfriend_is_trying/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)


My mom passed away 5 years ago and I think of her every day. My dad went through a really bad depression and I had to take care of myself basically. 

During the Christmas holidays my dad told me that he had been seeing someone for a while. I noticed that he was happier and I guess I was happy for him. I didn't want him to be lonely forever but I did feel like my mom was being erased completely. He never wanted to talk about her and he got rid of all pictures with her in them. He said that his gf will be spending Christmas with us and then moving in. I wasn't happy at all. I don't even know her but I didn't say anything.

I met her on Christmas and usually my dad and I put the star on the tree that day. We would put the star on the tree and watch the grinch. It's our tradition and we kept it even when we were grieving my mom. It's the only tradition from when she was with us that we actually kept. When his girlfriend came over he put the star on with her while I was in the bathroom. Also we didn't watch the grinch because she hates it. I know I sound spoiled and childish but I was so angry. We've been doing this my whole life and she just came in and destroyed it. The whole night she didn't even bother getting to know me at all. She was all over my dad and pretty much ignored me. I told my dad about how upset I was about our tradition and he said I should grow up and that things change. 

I didn't like her because she gave me a bad feeling so I never got close to her. She complained to my dad about it and he got mad at me for not making her feel welcomed. I felt bad because she makes my dad really happy so I tried being more friendly with her. 

In front of my dad she was nice to me but when we were alone she ignored me or spoke to me with attitude. She even told me that I was a brat and I make my dad's life harder. I told him but he didn't believe me and yelled at me for trying to sabotage his relationship. He said that I wanted him to die alone and be sad and that I was selfish. I was so shocked because none of it is true. My dad basically treated me like I wasn't there at all after that. I felt like I did when my mom died, all alone. 

I stayed up really late one night because I just couldn't sleep and wanted to sneak in a midnight snack. The gf was in the kitchen on facetime so I decided to be nosey and listen. She was talking about my dad and how much she loves him. Then she said that he had ""this dumb daughter"" and she wondered if it was too late for adoption. Her and her friend laughed at that. She said that I was a little b*tch and she hated me. Her friend then said something about boarding school or military school but I left so I didn't hear the rest.

I was so exhausted from all the crying I did so I actually slept. I didn't tell my dad and I don't even know if I should since he probably won't believe me. I really miss my mom. I kinda want to go live with my grandparents (mom's parents) now but I don't want my dad to think that I'm leaving him.

What do I do? Can I even do anything? How do I get my dad to listen to me? Would I be wrong for leaving?"

I needed some time to sort out the situation but I did read most as many replies as I could and I appreciate all the advice and messages especially from those who had been put in similar situations as I.  I guess I should start by clearing a few things up. First off, to everyone who thought my story had holes in it, it definitely did and I'm sorry for that. At the time and even now I was missing a lot of information and was filling in holes as best I could with what I had. I also didn't want the post to get too long so I left out information that I guess would have painted a better picture of my situation. I'll try my best to include those missing details. If you're just interested in the update skip down a few paragraphs.

So details about John, he is part of Sara and I's social circle and lives quite close to us, some of the behavior from John towards Sara that made me uncomfortable throughout the course our relationship included; constantly making comments about her body, putting his arm around her every chance he could, asking her to go with him on trip to europe last summer just the two of them, poking her breasts when she's wearing tight clothing, saying things like I'm lucky I met her when I did or she would've been with him by now, etc. It's not any one thing but a cumulation of everything that made me uncomfortable with her spending a lot of time with him. She never encouraged his behavior at least when I was around but didn't actively discourage it either despite we openly talking to her about my boundaries. She just brushed it off as them knowing each other for so long and being comfortable with one another.

A few smaller details I guess were relevant I should mention. One, we are not in the US, Covid while still obviously an issue in our country our area is relatively Covid free and everyone going to the party Sara went to were part of our larger social circle. It was at a large condo a friend of ours was renting for the summer it was not some open invite party with 100+ people. Still dumb I know, there were 30-ish maybe forty people there so in hindsight yeah no one should have been at the party to begin with.. Lastly, clearing up both Sara and I's financial situation. I am lucky enough to have my parents paying for my tuition whatever scholarships didn't cover so I can focus my resources on just day to day living cost like rent, groceries etc. Sara on the other hand was pretty much thrown to the wolves after finishing highschool. Her parents like I stated in my edit are very religious and very controlling so they told Sara they were only going to pay for her schooling if she went to a local college. She refused and came to my school. She lived in residency for her first two years which was covered by financial aid, I got my apartment about a year ago and with Covid and her not wanting to go back home we decided it would be best if she moved in with me. Her finances are basically completely tied up on tuition and student loans so I offered to keep paying full rent despite her living with me full time.

**Actual Update**: Oh boy I wish I could say things have gotten more clear in the past week but honestly it's been a total clusterf\*ck and it's only gotten worse. I spent a few days at Sam's reaching out to friends trying to get a clearer picture of what happened that night before going back to talk to Sara. I got told same story multiple times, that she was the one who started flirting with John and led him upstairs. I should say right now in my first conversation with Sara confronting her she didn't explicitly say she had intended to sleep with him that night she just confirmed she took him upstairs. She was basically having panic attack throughout the entire conversation so I had a hard time pushing for clarity. So by this point in my heart I was trying to find any excuse at all for her to save our relationship but my mind was telling me that the relationship was over at least for the time being but as many of you commented despite my obviously grief in losing a 2 year relationship I decided I'd be willing to let her stay in my apartment again rent free to at least the end of October to sort out other living arrangements and support.

I called her about 3 days after staying at Sam's and told her I'm willing to listen to her side of the story but I need the complete truth about everything and she agreed so I went back to my apartment later that evening. We sat down and I asked her about what really happened that night. She started crying right away but not panicking and told she had to tell me something about herself. Sara has always been into the partying scene more than me, I've never really been comfortable around drugs and that environment in general but I went with her anyways about once a month or so. Her on the other hand would have girls' nights out and parties pretty much every weekend. Right at the beginning of our relationship I told her I'm not really comfortable being with someone that is in involved with hard drug use, my brother has a history of addiction and I've seen what it can do to somebody and the people around them. She told me that's fine since she only drinks and smokes weed occasionally. Well it turns out for about a year now she started doing harder drugs at parties when I'm not there and her ""girls' nights"" were often just her and some from our social circle  John included going to a friends apartment to do shrooms. I was shocked to say the least and I didn't even know what to think in that moment, I just tried to ask her more about what happened on the night she was assaulted and if she was intending on cheating on me that night. She comes clean and tells me she did lead John upstairs but swears she wasn't trying to sleep with him but wanted drugs. He told her it was cocaine but obviously it was not since only fentanyl and alcohol showed up in her system at the hospital. She told me he immediately started coming on to her but she tried to fight him off but eventually she was too drugged out to fight back.

After consoling her for a while I asked her what her relationship with John was really like before and if they did anything together before what happened that night. She admitted that they made out a few times before around Christmas last year but promised it didn't go any further than that. She was begging me to forgive her and that she needs me in her life. That she just was in a rebellious phase because of her upbringing. I didn't know what to believe anymore and still don't to be honest. I just was completely overwhelmed by everything, so I told her I needed to clear my head and left again. Sam was nice enough to let me stay at his place again. I talked to some of my friends she said she was doing drugs with and they confirmed, I was pretty upset at them for hiding it from me but they told me she basically forced them to keep it a secret from me. It feels like so much of my relationship was a lie, she wasn't the person I thought she was and she lied constantly for who knows how long. At this point my mind is basically made up so I call her and told her it's over but she can stay at my apartment till the end of October but only if she finds a therapist and gets help during that time.

She basically lost it during the call but my mind was made up so I just said I'd be staying at Sam's for a while and hung up. I wish that was the last of the sh\*t that happened but literally a day after that I start getting spammed with hate messages and calls from friends, relatives and people I don't even know. Turns out she's posted all over social media about how I was breaking up with her because she was raped and was kicking her out with nowhere to go in these COVID times. She also wrote that I've been emotionally abusing her after her assault, victim blaming her and stopping her from getting an therapist. I'm completely lost, I'm furious, heartbroken, I can't even describe all the emotions I felt. I called her again that night and told her she has two weeks to move out now and I don't want to hear from her again. I had to spend the past week playing damage control, trying to clear my name on social media calling friends and family. I was ostracized by co-workers though luckily my boss was on my side, I was getting doxed, death threats, my life basically fell apart. Sam thank god was completely understanding through all of this and said I could stay at his place until Sara moved out.

She's moving out on Friday but I don't want to go back to that apartment anyone. I've had to cut out friends, my reputation is now in the garbage. I lost the first and only person I've ever loved, I don't know anymore. I lowkey want to die but I'll find a therapist sooner or later. I just feel numb to everything. I don't even know if I'm right or wrong in this situation anymore.  I hope I haven't rambled on too much, I know this post is really long but thank you really for everyone who showed support in the last post, it meant a  lot.

**TLDR**: Girlfriend lied to me about the night she was raped. Turns out she was with him that night to get drugs, had being doing hard drugs behind my back for months, cheated on me with the friend that ended up assaulting her and then lied on social media about how I had been emotionally abusing despite my best effort to support her causing my life to fall apart.

**Edit**: Someone’s comment made me realize she’s was still lying to me the second time I talked to her. She changed her story about what she was drugged with and I didn’t even realize. I was not told by the hospital what she had in her system and I’m not very knowledgeable on drugs in general, all that information I had came from Sara. I don’t even know if she was drugged against her will at all at this point. God, I’m doubting everything now, this is not the person I thought she was. I don’t even care, she’s out of my life now"

This title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23F) and my husband (24M). 
We've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. I got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. Ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. Its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. In the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. He really loved her and he never hid that from me but I thought it was over once she moved away. Now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and I can name the second child. When I asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. He doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
Is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name OUR child like that.
Thank you! "

If you'd like to follow me, I invite you. I will post updates as I have them until I have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


UPDATE #2 FOLLOWING MONDAY'S NOTRE DAME GAME:

Leading up to Monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download Snapchat, which I had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. I bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. He has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

Anyway, so Monday rolls around, I'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. I knew he'd have other friends there, all of which I'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. I get over there around 2. He has one friend already there and is expecting more. They trickle in and I'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. We cut up after the game, played some pool, James had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. I was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so I could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what I did. I did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. After some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

I asked James if we could talk outside. We walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""I know I kissed you the other day, and I don't know if that was something I should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and I think I may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" I was absolutely out there now. No turning back, I basically just told him I had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. He didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why I haven't brought it up before now. Obviously I told him I had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the KISS! He reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. I could come to him with whatever was on my mind and I just teared up. It wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. I gave him a hug and told him I appreciated that, we sat down and I explained to him how confused I've been these last couple weeks. How this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. I sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. He is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things I said, they were all comforting. He told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. He is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. Not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. A few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.I don't know what I would call the gut feeling I had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out WITH him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. Do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  I felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. I have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. He explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but I shouldn't be pressured. I wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. I turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. Full on made out for what seemed like ever. It was the most satisfying kiss I've ever had. This where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) I'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

By this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and I had to go. He walked me to my car and we made out a second time before I got in. He told me to get home safe and I did. I texted him to let him know I got home safe and hopped in the shower. I was so emotionally charged that I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 AM. I ended up calling out of work Tuesday. James and I have plans to hangout again this weekend. He wants to go out for food and a place called Topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, I've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. I'm really looking forward to it and I'm just taking things day to day at this point. I know where we stand and I'm happy.

Thank you for all of your support. I have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. I just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. You only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. I am learning this myself and I'm telling you, it's liberating.

I'll post any other updates here, above this one.  If anything big happens in the meantime I will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

Lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on Saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. I was very observant in our interactions, however, I didn't want to be so observant that I overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so I went with the flow and the vibes were great. We hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when I had the opportunity in conversation I mentioned that I had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and I told him that although I hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and I thought I might be curious to try it. I delivered this passively, just so not to put HIM on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. It felt like the time to make a move but I just didn't do it. We were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and I just didn't do it. It was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. Plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

Fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time I've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) We got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new NBA 2k20 demo on PS4, I'll admit I'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but I kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. At the end of the night, around 11p I went to leave, I had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. I went in for our hug, when I pulled back I kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and I laid it on him, I went right in and kissed him. It was short, I didn't use much tongue, but I pulled back and said ""I guess I can say I've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, I guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, I had one on mine AND IT WAS FIREWORKS IN MY STOMACH. I played it cool, I left and texted him when I got home that I was home safe and I thanked him again for a good time. He replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. He asked if I wanted to come over Monday night for the Notre Dame game and a cook out, I told him I'd love to and I'll bring some ribs to cook.

We have texted as normal today and I can't tell you how excited I am for Monday and to see what happens next. I know I waited awhile to update but I felt like I had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so I wanted to wait until I had more to report. I will post another update in the comment section here after Monday.

Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. I feel like I'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41."

&#x200B;

I don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

I received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. I was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. His mood has been pretty touch and go lately so I was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and I thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

I basically said I know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because I haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. I absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. I stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? You want me to get rid of him?""

I ***EXPLICITLY*** said ""No I would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. This is where shit started to hit the fan. He said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that I was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if I was fucking sick in the head.

I fucked up here. I shouldn't have said this but I don't handle confrontation well and I pretty much lost my cool at this point. I told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. He completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (I agree) and started calling me a number of names. He then started to get extremely personal saying I never cared about his little brother and that I'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

That is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. I still cant bellieve it and I don't think I'm ever going to forgive hm for that. Like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. He knows exactly how I feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? He can seriously go fuck himself because I'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

He then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes I know I'm basically killing his brother all over again??? I was crying so much at this point I didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. I have no idea where he's gone or where he is and I honestly don't even know if I care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

I still can't believe he reacted the way he did. He was like a completely different person. Not once in the four years I've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. I was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as I was.

THEN this fucking morning I get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for FORCING HIM TO REMOVE THE TATTOO. Apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them I've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

WHAT THE FUCK?!?! I EXPLICITLY TOLD HIM I WOULD NEVER ASK HIM TO DO THAT. When I told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. Feckin lovely.

I seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. I'm still in total shock and just so confused. I hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. I don't see what I could have done differently? I shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

I'm just at a complete loss right now. A day ago I thought of this guy as my future husband and now I just don't know. I wish I never said anything.

I've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him I've never seen before. Im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. How the fuk would we even move froward from this? Am I the one in the wrong here for the comment I made? I know I shouldn't have said it but I personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am I supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? Anything I sy is just going to sound like I'm lying in response to their negative reactions. I seriously have no idea what Im supposed to do here. I feel like this is going to ruin my life.

I just don't fucking know.

For starter's, thank you for the out pouring support and advice! I feel much less alone in this. 

Rufus is doing well and recovering at a friend house with her husband, along with my other dogs and senior reptiles. 

I decided to re-home the rest of them for the own well being. 

I also left some of my essentials and important possessions with her for when I left. 

Initially, when I sat my husband down it went smoothly. He agreed to seek anger management and therapy. But when I made it clear the dogs weren't coming back for a while, he got angry. He felt like was being immature, and he was being treated like an abuser. 

Reminding him that what he was doing was abusive, seemed to ""hurt his pride"" so he went to take a walk to cool off. 

Unfortunately for him he left his phone behind, and it started to go off constantly after about 10 minutes or so. 

Now I have never once felt the need to go through his phone, but last night I decided to. I have no idea why, and I kind of regret it. But I did, and I found some wild shit I was not expecting. 

Turns out, he was linking up with his old high school flame, a crazy bugger we'll call Sarah. 

Sarah was crazy I'll-kill-myself-if-you-leave-me daddy issues kind of crazy. She even stalked me for a bit early in our relationship, but it seemed like he wanted nothing to do with her. 

Turned out, a few months before quarantine they were chummy again and were hooking up, sexting, trading nudes. You know, the whole package. 

I couldn't help but think maybe his sudden spike in agression was stemming from this double life/lacking sex with his ex stress. 

When he returned, he knew something was up. And I let him know I knew. And he LOST IT. 

Crying, please don't leave me, I love you, I don't know why I did it, the whole works. I told him I was leaving, and he tried to stop me, but with some help from my friend and her husband I was able to leave without things getting physical. 

I still haven't told him I'm pregnant, but I'm roughly 8 weeks and still haven't decided what to do about that. He still doesn't know. Thankfully, I have no STD's even though he was having sex with both of us at the same time, unknowingly. 

I'm heart broken, and filling for divorce and most likely going to avoid bringing a kid into all of this mess. But Rufus is being his always supportive self, so I'm going to press on and hope for the best."

In Late July, my boyfriend (m24) our son (m2), and I (f22) went to his family’s lake cabin, as we do every so often. My boyfriend was jet skiing and he had a terrible accident. It was one of the worst things that’s ever happened to our family, i honestly didn’t think he was going to make it, but he’s still here. He’s been in the hospital almost this entire month. He’s made progress but there’s still a ways to go. 

During the early days of his stay in the hospital, there’s a lot of family drama that’s been happening between his family and I. His parents (m45 and f43) have been blaming me for the accident, even though I absolutely had nothing to do with it. 

My boyfriend’s mother locked me out of their house and kept my son inside with them. They have a house way out in the country, I didn’t have service to call anyone or the police. When she decided to let me back in, she slapped me (which wasn’t her first or last time doing so) and told me she never liked me because I don’t work (I am a stay at home mom). She talks about me to their friends, to my face, and basically outcasts me. She even said since my boyfriend will basically be disabled, she’s gonna take full custody of my son. I honestly wish I could tell my boyfriend what’s happening but he probably won’t comprehend. I’m honestly fed up. I just don’t know what to do."
dcz74v,My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,17191,0.96,1158,2019-10-04 05:05:12,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcz74v/my_parents_chose_their_new_families_over_me_so_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dcz74v/my_parents_chose_their_new_families_over_me_so_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either."
fn2thu,"Update: my wife said something strange about her ex, and it's really getting to me (I'm 31M, she's 31F)",17169,0.92,926,2020-03-22 22:27:03,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fn2thu/update_my_wife_said_something_strange_about_her/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fn2thu/update_my_wife_said_something_strange_about_her/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/flew19/my_wife_said_something_strange_about_her_ex_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TL;DR my wife occasionally talks about her ex as though she misses him, and then the other night she said he was the only guy she ever knew with beautiful feet. (Yeah, weird... But also hurtful towards me and my nasty feet.)

So I actually tried to post this the very next morning, while replies to my first post were still streaming in, because I talked to Abby almost immediately and consider the issue largely settled. Automod deleted it so I've had to wait a couple days. In hindsight I'm glad I've had to wait because it gave me more time to consider the responses I received.

First of all, I wanted to thank everyone who responded yesterday. 

Unfortunately I did receive a bit of bizarre advice-- a number of users called my wife an ""alpha widow"", still others told me to divorce her immediately because she MUST be cheating. I had a few users calling my wife a bitch. This was a sobering reminder that anonymous internet people don't understand the nuances of my marriage, and people tend to project their own insecurities onto other people's situations. So I'd advise anyone considering posting here-- use discretion in what advice you take.

(Just to get ahead of some of the speculation, Brock has lived in South Korea for two years, he is prohibited by a court order from contacting Abby, and I have open access to her DMs anyway. If she were cheating, I'd be the first to know.)

I also received some great advice about ""trauma bonding"" and recovering from abusive exes. These responses were the most helpful.

All this said, here's what I posted about that night:

I was sitting on the bed last night, just kind of brooding, when Abby came in. She sat on the bed next to me and looked at me. She must have known something was up because I haven't been myself these last few days and our bedroom has been dead since the feet comment.

Abby asked me if everything was okay. I gave her a weary smile and said no, I suppose not. She frowned and asked if we could talk about it. I sighed heavily and was quiet for a few moments. Abby didn't look nervous or defensive, she looked genuinely concerned. So I figured she must not be aware of how hurtful her Brock comments have been, and I should just be honest.

I started by asking if she was willing to be 100% honest with me. She said that she was. So then I asked if she's happy being married to me, and if she'd prefer being with someone else instead. She seemed a little taken aback by the question and said she would never dream of marrying someone else. My voice was shaking the whole time and Abby looked like she was ready to cry, too.

Finally I lay everything out. I tell Abby that a few nights ago, we were talking about feet, and she had said that my feet were gross, but Brock's feet were ""beautiful."" I said maybe it sounds really silly and dumb but that comment made me feel really ugly and it broke my heart. (She gasped and started crying at this point.) I said there's been a few other times where she mentioned Brock and acted like she really missed him, because she sounded enamored when she talked about him. I said I think that Brock was probably a lot more attractive than me and she would have preferred staying with him over me.

Abby cried for long time before she was able to say anything. It was probably only two minutes but it felt like forever. 

She said she didn't realize that she was mentioning Brock that way and upsetting me so much. She said she couldn't imagine marrying anyone else but me. I said ""Even though I'm uglier than Brock?"" and she started crying again, like really bawling. After she pulled herself together again she admitted that Brock was a very attractive man, and that she had been infatuated with him. (It seemed extremely difficult for her to get those words out.) But Brock had also been controlling and incredibly cruel. She never felt safe or at ease with him, but she did feel safe with me. She said she had married ME, and wanted children with ME, and that she had never even dreamed of marrying Brock, let alone having kids with him.

Then we talked about some deeper more personal stuff that I'd rather not go into here..

I did mention some of the trauma bonding stuff that some Redditors had mentioned last night, and Abby admitted that she had felt addicted to the drama while she was with Brock. She agreed to talk with her counselor about her unresolved issues with that past relationship.

The conversation took well over an hour and we both cried a lot. But I did feel much better afterwards. We cuddled for a while before I joked that I guess Abby was stuck with my nasty feet for life. She took my head in her hands and said she thought I had the most beautiful feet in the world, because they were mine. We made out and made love for the first time in a week. Maybe that's TMI but I figured a lot of folks here would appreciate a happy ending.

So, I guess the issue is largely settled. I do think that maybe I overreacted a little, but my feelings at being (inadvertently) made to feel less attractive were real. I'm glad I didn't second guess my emotions and suppress them.

Thank you to everyone who offered advice in the original thread. It seems the situation has been resolved.

Edit: though I will add that I still feel a little sad that I am not as attractive as Abby's ex. Not because I'm jealous but because I want to be the best she's ever had in every way, including physically. But I guess I simply have to make peace with the fact that I'm not the most attractive guy Abby has been with. I suppose a lot of us have to make peace with that, huh?

Edit 2: I appreciate all your kind words. I would like to add that I do not consider the situation magically over, but I count it as resolved because Abby and I are both moving in the right direction and actively working on fixing this.

I would also like to add that even with this positive update, I am seeing some disappointing comments. Users saying that I'm immature, that my wife is definitely totally cheating on me, that I am a troll making this whole thing up because my writing style isn't very good, that this sub is a terrible place to share a ""serious marital issue"" and I shouldn't have done it, etc etc... I also a few interesting PMs trying to rope me into some kind of anti-woman community, and one instructing me to kill myself.

I've read that Reddit can be toxic but this has been eye opening. I do want to post an update maybe a month down the road, but I do think in light of all this negativity, that maybe I will just leave things here.

There is a LOT that I did not post here, and I mean A LOT, I guess it's understandable that some people are treating this as their blank canvas to project their own insecurities.

Thank you to everyone who provided positive input and constructive criticism."
cvnhto,My [22F] boyfriend of 3 years [23M] and I just had a huge fight over a tampon.,17141,0.87,2837,2019-08-26 18:06:09,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvnhto/my_22f_boyfriend_of_3_years_23m_and_i_just_had_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvnhto/my_22f_boyfriend_of_3_years_23m_and_i_just_had_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,,False,"Yes. You read that correctly. The subject matter is... a tampon. To preface, I took a plan B recently and with that comes your period. So today I woke up at about 7 AM as I began my menstrual cycle. Going to skip the TMI, and simply say I had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). Unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. I asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. Just a straight up “no I’m sleeping and tired leave me alone” I tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and I REALLY needed his help in that moment as I was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with “no use a towel or something and you go get it”. I started crying bc I’m a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn’t help me when I REALLY needed it. He is the reason I currently got my period anyways (plan B). Well I guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said I “do too much” and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. In the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. I know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. I guess I’m just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. Was I being too dramatic or am I justified in wanting to break up over this? His reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. But to play the devil’s advocate, he is a D1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. Sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before I move out and back home across the country. Bc if I decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn’t let me lol).

Edit: he is home from practice. Not sorry. Not remorseful. Still blaming me for doing too much. I can’t stop crying. I showed him all of your responses and he said you’re all wrong and I’m stupid for taking advice from Reddit. I’m heartbroken.

Edit 2: I fuckin love reddit man. I’m sitting here crying but every response I read makes me feel a little stronger. I’m the biggest cry baby ever and I really thought I loved this guy. So naturally I’m super sad. But I need this. I needed to be shown that this isn’t normal or ok. Thank you guys.

Edit 3: ok guys.. TMI WARNING.. some are saying why didn’t I just put some toilet paper in my undies and walk downstairs. I slept naked and woke up to blood all over my legs. Ran to the bathroom and didn’t want to get up and get blood everywhere. It was coming out profusely and I didn’t want to get up until I was able to insert a tampon."

ORIGINAL POST:
I apologize in advance, this is 100% drunk stream of consciousness.

I’ve (39m) been with my girlfriend (31f) for 6 years. The first 4 were good, the last two have been on a steady decline leading up to the discovery that she’s been cheating on me with her coworker for a year. Long story short, I suspected, snooped, found out. So it goes.

The thing is I pay for everything. I have a great job that affords me the ability to not care about the cost of anything. She quit her job to be a SAHM and I pay for her daughters private school, hobbies etc. It was honestly not a big deal until I found out she was cheating on me and ridiculing me behind my back. I’m done, it’s over. The problem is what to do about her daughter.

I’ve grown really close to her daughter (Olivia). She’s 14, she’s brilliant, and honestly we’re like best friends. We talk about everything, I guide her as best I can and she’s so fucking smart it’s almost ridiculous. I want to continue to support her financially but I know her mother would throw a shit fit if she knew I wanted to pay for Olivia’s education etc and not for the perks that come from being rich.

Her mother has grown complacent with a lifestyle she wont be able to afford when I leave. I fear she will try to use Olivia to manipulate me into funding her extravagant bullshit. I don’t want Olivia to go through that.

I do want to continue to give Olivia everything she needs to grow into the woman I know she can be. I love her very much, and she astounds me with everything she does. I want to support that. My worry is that if I continue to support her, then her mother will try to extort me for additional funds for herself. She might even use Olivia as a barging chip.

Sorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m kind of a mess right now. I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m scared.

UPDATE:
Basically I wanted to say to say thank you to everyone who responded. It got more attention than I thought it ever would and people have been so supportive and kind.

After much thought I decided to appeal to my GFs better nature and have an honest conversation with her, it went surprisingly well. We agreed the relationship had run it’s course, she apologized for cheating on me and not ending it when she knew she should. It was about money...fine I knew it, I don’t have the energy to hold a grudge right now.

We’ve agreed that it was a good idea for me to fund Olivia’s schooling. I’m happy to do it and my GF is ok with a clean break.

We had “the talk” with Olivia. Her mother and I both agreed that we keep things vague, the truth isn’t pretty and won’t do anyone any good. She was angry with me and that’s ok. I’m not going to be around anymore so she needs her mom and the idea of who her mom is more than she needs me.

That’s it. I hope Olivia and I can have a relationship sometime in the future, but for now I’m removing myself from the equation.

Thanks again to everyone who gave me advice and support. It really meant the world to me to know that so many people really cared.

EDIT:

So ok wow, I didn't expect this response at all. Thank you to the majority of the people here. I've done my best to respond to the private messages etc.

There are a few things I want to address in terms of misconceptions/FAQs:

1. It's 100% my decision to pay for Olivia's schooling. I pay the school directly as I have always done and her mother doesn't control that. I'm looking at this as doing something for someone I love. Her mom might benefit from it, but she isn't any part of the reason I'm doing this.

2. I think the way we decided to tell Olivia about the break up was the right way. I've let her know that I'll always be around if she wants to see me, but things happen and it just didn't work between her mother and I. I disagree with people saying I should air the dirty laundry. It's between her mother and I and I want to keep it that way. Her dad died before she could know him, her mom has been the only parent she's ever known and i'm not willing to destroy their relationship for the sake of this truth. It's on her mom to improve herself in the future otherwise she'll just expose herself later on.

3. I'm doing alright. I meant it when I said that the response to these posts has been more than I could have ever imagined. I feel really blessed that a bunch of internet strangers take time out of their day to write me words of encouragement, support, send PMs etc. I even had a lady offer to fly out to me, make me a steak and blow me. It was probably definitely 97% a catfish, but the ego boost was nice. Point being, I really appreciate you all, thank you.

EDIT #2:

OK folks,
I think I'm gonna take my bow now, it's time for me to leave and focus on the future. Again, I really appreciate all of you taking the time to write such motivational, heartfelt, inspiring things to a complete stranger. What started as a drunken rant really turned into something special that has helped me immeasurably, I'll always be grateful for you all. Im bookmarking this so I can look at it when Im feeling down (mods please don't delete again...)
I wish the best for all of you. I might make an update in the future, but for now I'm done. I'm content in knowing I did right by myself and what I believe in. I have no regrets with how I handled things.

Goodbye for now, and thanks again!"

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her."

&#x200B;

ETA: Hey everyone - thank you for your kind words and messages. I'm in the process of getting checked out. Phone was checked, no installed software, I did have my location shared with him through google maps, which has been turned off. Phone is being kept on airplane mode, friend suggested I not block him, let him text me and leave messages, see what he says. I only kept reddit and a few other apps. I'm safe, and still trying to process. I will get to talk to a counselor tonight. Thank you again <3  I am not getting back together with him, our relationship is over.

I am usually a fan of vanilla sex, my boyfriend isn't. He likes the BDSM side of things. When we first got together 5 years ago, I had barely done anything other than missionary. He is my second relationship, and my third sexual partner. We explored some things, and I found out that I enjoyed being *lightly choked* and by that I mean I liked having his hand on me, nothing more.

Last night, we were enjoying our time together, and things got.. weird, uncomfortable, and flat out dangerous. I was laying on my stomach, and he was laying on top of me. He started getting more and more aggressive, pulling my hair, and pinning my arms at my sides. I didn't argue, in the heat of the moment it was nice. He started choking me, he literally put me in a headlock. I couldn't breathe and started seeing stars and getting tunnel vision. I tried moving my hands, but he had trapped me, I tried to use our safe word, but I literally couldn't speak. I couldn't breathe at all. I passed out.

When I came to, I was rolled over on my back. I started crying, and asked him how long I had been unconscious for. He said he wasn't sure, and that he ""Didn't notice"" that I had even passed out until he had ""finished"". I told him to get away from me. He argued that I didn't say anything, or tap out. I said how could I? You pinned me down and choked me until I passed out? I called a friend and left immediately.

He's been calling me all day. He doesn't want me to throw away 5 years of a relationship for 1 mistake. I am hesitant to go back to him. I'm afraid, how could he not notice me no longer making noise (I'm super vocal) or going limp? My friend says I can stay with her as long as I want, and for now I've turned my phone off. One of the last texts he sent me he said that it's just because I'm ""inexperienced with breath play"" and idk what that even means. He said we never talked about what happened if things went too far, and I say he took all my options away from me (pinning my arms down, choking me until I couldn't speak).

I feel disgusting and violated. I briefly thought about filing a police report, but for what? In five years, nothing like this has ever happened. Is this normal? Could it really have been an accident that I'm blowing out of proportion? Did I really just not understand kinky sex?"
a7idgp,Found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens,16773,0.96,2211,2018-12-19 08:30:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a7idgp/found_out_husband_is_the_one_stealing_shallots/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a7idgp/found_out_husband_is_the_one_stealing_shallots/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"This has been going on for several years. I live in a small rural neighborhood with an HOA where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. As with most HOAs, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. There will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. It really annoys my husband. I just laugh at it

Well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. There were a lot of emails sent about this. A lot of drama. I don’t remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

So then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. Some people thought it could be deer eating them. There were several theories. The next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. This year it started happening again and people flipped out. All caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. Two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

It started out being funny because I’m not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. But this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

So anyway, you already know what happens. I walk down to the bottom of our property that I don’t visit often and I find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. Like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

I went inside and told my husband jokingly “I think we’re being framed for the onion heist!” He got this really weird look on his face and I had the realization and asked him if he didn’t have anything to do with this

He confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. He was sneaking out at night to do this. I asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

I don’t even know. This makes me really uncomfortable. The man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and I didn’t even notice? Why wouldn’t he just tell me? Like this has been going on for three years it’s not like he just did it once as a prank

I don’t know what to do. Can anyone help me think this through. Maybe I’m overreacting but I’m pretty upset

We'd gotten into an argument. She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

Sorry for ranting and any grammar errors I’ve been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. Also this is a throwaway so I don’t completely dox myself. 

My wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. 

My wife herself was born there, and came to the US when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (This is NOT a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). I was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

As she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the US. It just kind of happened that way. (She entered on a F1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

Understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we’ve been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the US with my family and one in Russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

Until last week she hadn’t seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as I have custody. 

As school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it’d be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. She wanted to bring my daughter with her - I initially was opposed to this - but I caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

Through her trip she hasn’t been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on WhatsApp and photos etc. which is understandable - she’s on vacation and I don’t expect constant alerts, but I would have liked a little more of an update. My daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

Yesterday morning I had texted my wife that I’d be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. She read the message but never answered. I told my daughter the same and she never responded. I assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

I had a hellish day at work so I went right to bed so I could be up early to go get them. 
I wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and I look at my phone to message them. I see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn’t know how to get home. Confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 Panicked I reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. She finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn’t want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

Pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that I took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - I go off on her through text. She tells me off and stops answering me. 

I reach out to her mom through WhatsApp (who doesn’t speak English at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. Her mom said she didn’t know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

Panicked I go to reach out the US consulate in Saint Petersburg only to find online it was shut down in March and the nearest is in Moscow. I reach out to the Moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a HUGE help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. Even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

My wife still hasn’t answered me since our blow out. And her mom said she hasn’t seen or heard from her since this morning.

What the hell am I supposed to even do with this? The lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me."

First some backstory. I was adopted by my mother and late father. I love my mother and loved my dad. After he died 4 years ago my mom remarried 2 years later with my current stepfather (lets call him John). I have one younger brother (17) (the biological kid of my mom and late dad) and 2 stepsisters both \~10 years older than me. John generally doesn't care for me or my brother. Sometimes it feels like he is just leeching off of my mother if that makes sense. I dont really like him but we never had a big argument and just kinda try to live along untill I finally move out. Me, brother, mom and John live together. 

Now to the present. Due to the Coronavirus we all had to stay at home the past couple weeks. Mom doesnt work right now but John can work from home. Since everyone stayed home all day, naturally there was more talk in the family and John opened up a little bit to us. He expressed some worldviews that I didn't expect of him such as that the economy should continue running and it doesn't matter if old and sick people die because they are a burden to the country anyway. I told him that he is infact old and sick (he has complications with the heart and is 64 years old). My brother was laughing at my remark but John didnt take my comment well and told me to to apologize. I was kinda taken aback because for me, I just stated a fact. I said that there was nothing to apologize to. He repeated that I needed to apologize. I looked at my mom and told/asked her to defend me. To my surprise she also said that I should apologize to him. I asked what I did wrong and he started screaming at me to stop being disrespectful and that he is feeding us with the money that he earned and such. I started to cry because it felt like I was in a bad dream and then he got up and just slapped me across the face. It came out of the nowhere and I was just sitting there petrified. I guess I waited for my mom to say something but she didn't so i just got up and went into my room. I heard my brother screaming at my mom that he hated John. 

When I was my room, my brother texted me if I needed comfort or anything but I told him I'm ok.But I didn't feel ok and basically cried till I fell asleep. What made the feeling worse was that neither my mom nor John came to my room. Nothing. No asking how I was, just nothing. Its early morning now as I'm writing this and I still feel horrible. I dont want to get out of my room or see anyone. I still feel like I'm in a bad dream. 

I guess I'm just asking what to do now and if I was in the wrong or if my comment was offensive? I don't know.

Thanks already."

I remain overwhelmed by the comments. Please know I'm trying to read them.

We had a talk this morning. I apologised to him and he apologised to me; I still believe that whether or not it's an appropriate response he was responding to me having made him angry and I owed it to him to apologise. He promised it would never happen again of course and begged me not to tell anyone. The truth is that I am planning on leaving but I'm afraid; afraid to tell him, afraid for him to find out somehow, and afraid to tell my mam and dad because I'm ashamed of what's happened and ashamed that I could've ever let it get this far. It does feel like it's my fault. 

I am trying to get through the comments with the resources and take them down and contact them when I have the opportunity which will hopefully allow me to make a plan.

Well, i can say that i didn't expect such an overwhelming response to this post. With the quarantine I haven't had much time to do anything as I'm busy trying to keep a busy toddler occupied. I expected to come back to maybe 10-15 responses and I'm overwhelmed. I am trying to get through all of the comments and messages etc.

I know it was stupid of me to start the argument at the supper table (I hadn't even intended it to be an argument, really, but I recognise that I was nagging at him and nagged at him further over our son) and it was really stupid of me to nag at him to acknowledge our son knowing the mood he was in. I'm sensitive about that (which he does know) as my mam and dad ignored me as a kid a lot. They're great parents overall  but that really hurt me and he knows that and I just reacted. I plan to apologise to him about it regardless of anything else.

It's difficult for me to leave even just to cool everything out; I haven't really got any friends in our area, my family is either a drive and a ferry ride or a train and a ferry ride or a plane away, I stay at home and we have a joint account, plus with the quarantine I'm not sure I could even get out to anywhere with people I know.

I had forgotten that it was the friend's birthday today and he's gone out to his again. I had intended to talk with him over his drinking as my first step but I'm not able to now. Half of me is tempted to knock at the neighbors' and ask to stay even though I don't know them very well.

I know there were a few comments saying this was fake and I know it must seem like I'm terribly stupid because everyone always just thinks they'd leave if someone hit them but it's truly just not that simple when it actually happens. Please be kind to people and think about what you're saying.

basically what it says on the tin there.

We've been married nearly 4 years now, we have a 2 year old son.

My husband doesn't drink heavily often, but he does drink often. He's never been violent before, although right before Christmas he also drank a bit too much at a friend's (same friend as he was with yesterday evening) and was very angry with a lot of yelling and screaming and slamming things. He apologised the next morning and everything was fine afterward.

Yesterday afternoon he went over to see the same friend and came back quite drunk and belligerent. We had a short argument at the supper table which I regretted but I think it unfortunately set the tone for the rest of the evening.

He was standing at the cupboard putting leftovers away and I was standing at the sink when the incident happened. Our son was carrying the cat around and he kept saying ""daddy, look at my kitty"" and my husband was ignoring him. I said my husband's name, he said what, and I said, please acknowledge our son. He said ""I'm a little busy"" and I replied that all he had to do was say ""I know, buddy"" so our son didn't feel ignored. He turned and said ""don't tell me what to do"" and hit me with a closed fist.

I was shocked, our son was watching and began to cry, I picked him up. I said ""if you're going to come home like this then you'd better--"" and he raised his fist to me again, said ""yeah, you tell me what i'd better do"" and i backed down (I was holding our son at the time). Afterward he went to his den and I stayed upstairs with our son. He fell asleep down there and we did not talk again. (nearly 5:30 here now)

i'm not really sure what to do. It was all so sudden and confusing. He's not normally like this. Should I try to talk with him or just let it go and accept that it was probably a one off thing and that I'd already made him angry by arguing with him?"
9u4emi,My Fiancé took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.,16542,0.92,923,2018-11-04 21:28:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9u4emi/my_fiancé_took_my_birth_control_pills_and_stabbed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9u4emi/my_fiancé_took_my_birth_control_pills_and_stabbed/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I’m in my late 20s and I got engaged for my fiancé (29) who I’ve been with for 9 years. Our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. But recently he brought up that he wants kids. I said no I’m not ready and probably won’t be for a few years. He got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. I just moved on from it and didn’t give it a second thought. 

A week later I couldn’t find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but I couldn’t find them anywhere. Later that night he wanted to have sex, I said I couldn’t find my bc pills and he said it’s alright he’ll use a condom, I supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. For the next few weeks we just used a condom and I didn’t take the pill. In hindsight I should have got more when I couldn’t find the original pack but I couldn’t be bothered (my fault) 

On a few occasions we were having sex I noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn’t say anything so I said stop. The next day I was putting the recycling in the trash, as I was putting it in I seen my pills at the bottom. I instantly knew he had binned them. He knows I deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

It all made sense so I confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn’t answer me. He just kept walking away. I was so mad at him, it’s not right. You can’t just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. Does he have to carry it for 9 months? 

I haven’t been talking to him, I’m so annoyed. "

I tried to just get him to relax and he did but I could tell he was irritated the rest of the night. He kept glaring at me and his demeanor was colder. It honestly bothered me, I wanted to cry I had to hold in my tears. I hate to be talked to like that by him. Why would he snap at me over nothing? I wasn’t trying to make him feel like a “bitch”.

Here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

After I made my post, I waited 2 days to say anything to her because I wanted to get as much input as possible. I also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

I started reading comments right after I posted. I replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, I started to feel sick. I called my boss to ask for Friday off for personal reasons. I spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. We don't live together but I wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. We also have some good memories in that apartment and I think I would be sad if I had to continue to live there. 

This brings us to Saturday, the day I promised myself I would say something. I invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because I was getting so nervous that I completely lost my appetite. She walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. I was hoping to ease into it, but I ended up blurting out, ""I met Matt Blank"". She tried to act casual about it, but I could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. For the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, I talked about how I see the past 4 months completely differently. She started to cry and say she was sorry, I don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. I told her I'm going to work on forgiving her, because if I don't I think it will eat me up inside. I won't forget what happened but I'll at least try to move on. She started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. I interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

If I wasn't so emotionally crushed, I would have been amazed at the transition. She started begging me to give her another chance. I stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. I told her that I had already made up my mind to break up with her. After some back and forth, she realized that I was serious. I knew the exact moment she knew I was serious because she went from crying to yelling. It started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. It started off that I was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and I had a useless job. In the middle of her tirade, she said Matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

As she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. I'll summarize below:

She started sleeping with Matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. From there it went from once in a while to once a week. Matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. I think she was using the vacations because she missed being with Matt. 

I don't really remember the rest of Saturday. I spent Sunday with my friends which helped, I told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. I went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. I'm not sure what it said because I burned it. "
14dif6a,My (f59) son (m34) is the one responsible for my granddaughters (f1) death. I have no idea how to deal with this and move on with my family.,16422,0.92,391,2023-06-19 21:25:47,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14dif6a/my_f59_son_m34_is_the_one_responsible_for_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14dif6a/my_f59_son_m34_is_the_one_responsible_for_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"Edit: thanks for all the comments. To clarify: my granddaughter was compromised. She had already a condition that rendered it impossible for her to get her shots. Which I'd why my daughter was so carefull and didn't expose her baby to more than park air and took heavy precautions of they had to go to closed spaces with her. 


This is not about his daughter but his niece. 
I have 2 kids. My daughters daughter passed due to my sons stupidity.

My son Andrew marries Alexis 8 years ago. I am by no mean a Monster in law. Never have been. But Alexis is a nightmare. She is anti science pro Facebook science,  she is awefully entiteled and is sinking all their savings in some MLM scheme. And as such... they decided not to vaccinate their kids. They have a son (m10) and a daughter (f6).

A month ago my daughter, Jenny, came over with her baby to pick up some of her old things. She decided to stay for coffee and cake. 
Andrew and Alexis moved right across from us after the lock down lifted. My husband and I assume, it's because they were planing on using us a free childcare.

Anyway, as Jenny was over Alexis rung the doorbell. Before I could even say hello, her kids came spilling in. They are nice kids. Somewhat bratty but they do have a heart of gold. I love them so much. But because od them not being vaccinated, I don't like having them around the same time as babies.
I tried to keep things calm but the kids had run upstairs to where Jenny's baby was sleeping and were cuddling with her. I managed to get them to come down. But they had bee with the baby for a few minutes. 

Fast forward a few days. Jenny calls me in tears telling me her and her fiance are in the hospital because their baby had a high fever ans couldn't breathe properly. 
My husband and I hurried there. Then we spent the most excruciating 17 hours in the hospital that sadly ended with my granddaughter passing away. She had apparently caught whooping cough and her little lungs couldn't handle it. My daughter is absolutely destroyed.

I had a stinging suspicion and called my son. I asked him if his kids had been sick. He said that they had a nasty cough and a little fever but that they had managed. 
I don't know what happened. I lost it. I just started breathing heavy and crying hard and couldn't say much more but to say that his niece died because of him.

He had been calling me and his sister. And we haven't picked up. He has come over multiple times and I have not opened.

I tried to calm down and tell myself, that it's probabe that she caught it from someone else. Only that my daughter hadn't taken out granddaughter to places with kids for almost a month. Maybe at a super marked or in a walk. But my husband pointed out that it was likelier she caught it trough close contact. And it is possible to catch it outside. But not as likley.

I feel so mad... so angry. I don't know what to do. I live my other grand kids. And I feel like they are gonna suffer with them as parents.

How to we go forward? Jennybis never gonna forgive Andrew. And I don't know if I can. 

Tldr: my son didn't vaccinate his kids. They gave my daughters daughter whooping cough. My granddaughter died as a direct result of this. I don't know how to proceed in life."
illtan,My [33m] wife [25f] constantly makes a conscious effort to humiliate me during my lessons over Zoom,16367,0.97,2295,2020-09-03 08:52:52,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/illtan/my_33m_wife_25f_constantly_makes_a_conscious/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"While under normal circumstances I would try to communicate my feelings to my wife, I am at my wits' end for how to handle this situation, as I have exhausted all of the typical conflict resolution means.

Being a teacher, I am currently giving lessons over Zoom. I recognize that studying math over Zoom isn't the most exciting thing in the world for students, and I can barely get them to even pretend to be interested in my lessons when we're in the classroom, but they have done an admirable job of staying focused. My wife is making it extremely difficult on my end, though.

Several months ago when my lessons began, I went from working long hours to being at home all day. Unfortunately my wife does not seem to understand that while I am at home, and while I can occasionally help out with a chore or two, I still have actual work to do. Between lesson prep, grading, and meetings, my schedule is quite full.

The first time she interrupted my lesson, she abruptly opened the door to the room where I was teaching and loudly asked me to do the dishes. This was unbelievably awkward as I was in the middle of teaching three dozen tenth graders geometry. I told her we would talk about it later, but not being deterred, she asked if that was a ""yes"" or a ""no."" I said it was a ""yes,"" but that I was in the middle of a lesson. Without a word she closed the door. I got some chuckles from the students but a bit of red-cheeked embarrassment was the extent of the damage.

The next time, two days later, she again barged in holding a pair of my pants that I left on the floor of our bedroom. She loudly stated ""you need to pick up after yourself."" This time, before responding, I muted my mic and turned off my camera telling her that I was in the middle of a lesson. Again, she walked away without a word.

At this point I moved my setup into the basement of our house so I could avoid further interruption. Since my basement looks like it probably has a few dead bodies buried in it, my students have begun to call me ""Basement Dad,"" which is endearing, but I would rather teach in a room where I'm not going to get asbestos in my lungs. The trouble really began when I started locking the door to prevent interruptions.

My wife will begin by rattling the door a few times, followed by pounding on it. Then she'll groan loudly and say something negative about me. After that I can hear her walking around the house slamming doors. 

A few weeks ago, she was literally jumping up and down, stomping her feet, in the room above mine. In the first months of these online lessons I set up a hotkey to mute my mic and disable my camera instantly when needed, and luckily my reflexes honed from Counter-Strike in my teens has paid off. But there have been times where she has sneaked in an embarrassing moment for me. 

Every time I have patiently explained to her that I need complete quiet to teach my lessons, and she says ""yeah yeah yeah OK."" Then in the next lesson, without fail, she'll find something new to complain about and throw a tantrum, trying to humiliate me in front of my students. While my mute game is on point, students have recognized something is wrong. One of my 9th graders even sent me an email asking if everything was OK. I had to make up a lame excuse about needing to mute my mic because of a sudden grinding noise that happens in my old basement. There's no way she bought that. 

Since I'm unable to go out, unable to even enter the school grounds, and have no place to go to avoid my wife, I'm unbelievably anxious when I teach. I have tried talking to her calmly, and I even tried to get angry at her. When I yelled at her for forcefully sliding plastic files under the door so they'd float down in the background during my lessons, she expected me to apologize for getting angry at her.

How can I even approach this kind of problem?

TL;DR: my wife is acting ridiculous when I'm teaching lessons over Zoom. Most of the rest of the day she's normal, but during lessons she does everything in her power to sabotage me."

My husband shares a 15 year old with his ex girlfriend. They had her in high school. Ex is 30 and husband is 31. The ex never really makes good decisions and still acts like she's in high school. For most of step daughters life, she has lived with my husband. Two years ago, we had our first child together and step daughter was not happy and decided she wanted to live with her mom full time. Ex took us to court and somehow ended up getting 50/50 custody. We have tried to fight this to no avail. 

We are more strict with SD and don't allow her to have boys in her room, go to parties, etc. Her mom on the other hand lets her do whatever she wants. SD was coming back to us the end of July, ex calls us and tells us her boyfriend tested positive for corona and thinks they should all self isolate together. We all agree. 

My husband has been texting SD everyday to see how she's doing and she said she's tired and her muscles hurt. We think ok, she has a mild form. Nope, ex takes her to the doctor she's 17 weeks pregnant. I don't think we've ever been so furious in our entire life. Ex thinks its fine because everything turned out ok for her with SD. Yes, because someone else raised your kid MOST of her life. She didn't even see her for the first five years.

We don't even know what to do. She's so far along. My husband never wanted her to struggle like he did."

&#x200B;

So, I figured since the post sort of blew up a 3 weeks ago and people requested me to make an update to tell them what I ended up doing...Well here goes.

Well in the shortest way possible, I ended up breaking up with her, I realized in part thanks to some good advice I had gotten there was more that was bothering me other than the financial part. Thing is, when thinking to myself in the next few days I felt myself combing over every little detail of our relationship and quickly realized I was putting in way more then what I got back, no I am not saying I am some perfect saint, but I do think I deserve someone who appreciates what I already do, especially when what I already do so vastly outweighs what she did in our relationship.

Also a big one was the apparent maturity gap between the two of us which I looked over with my rose tinted in-love glasses, where as I have changed as a person from who I was when we started dating, she is still pretty much the same identical person and without trying to badmouth her, that is a person you can be without any issues when you between 15 and 20, not when you are in a committed relationship, thinking about having kids at some point, managing your own finances and planning for the future. 

And that brings me to the largest issue there, Planning, I am a planner, I look out for the future, I am not opposed to wasting some money to do fun stuff while I am young, but I don't want to risk ending up broke and unhappy when I am older because I refused to get serious in my youth and this is where our personal views seemed to clash to an extend where the good no longer outweighs the bad, she constantly lives in the moment, spends what she can spend and is sort of used to an easy ride where the biggest things she ever had to worry about are her grades, but for me I have faced financial issues since I was young so I know the value of money and I know that planning can spare you a lot of hurt, I am not saying either of our views are superior or better, I am saying when you are supposed to be a partnership but you wildly differ on the most basic foundations of that partnership, there is not much hope, as a result I realized I did not see myself getting more committed to her which means you sort of hit a roadblock in your relationship, I mean I am not a fan of marriage from the get go, but after such a long time, if you are not even remotely considering it, there is probably a larger issue.

This argument about finances brought up a whole load of other issues for me and honestly, I sort of started to dread what in my mind looked like me being expected to fund a lifestyle I from the ground up do not agree with, I realized I was losing my own self worth by accepting this sort of stuff and I realized the fact we had an argument about my money and her demanding to spend half of it made me feel like a glorified ATM.

Now the break up was really messy and her dad was a rock during the entire thing, he calmed the situation down a lot despite him really hating what was happening but I think he understood, I can't say I am not gutted about all of this, after all this is someone I was with for roughly three years and getting used to not having her or her family(Who I was really close too) Is difficult but in the end after the initial dust settled I sort of feel liberated and a lot happier than I did a few weeks ago, I wish her nothing but the best in the future and I know it has to be without me, as for me, I sort of feel like I get to start over, hopefully find someone a lot more suited to me in the future, but I won't be actively looking for me as honestly being single after such a long time in a relationship feels nice? I get to focus what little free time I have on myself which is something I have not been able to do for a long time, I get to indulge in my hobbies properly and so forth.

Anyhow, I want to thank everyone for their advice and if I was rude to anyone, I am sorry but at the time I was in a shitty emotional position, but I am doing a lot better now, so whether you figured I was a douche and completely disagreed with me or whether you think I was a good fellah and figured I was right, or somewhere on the extremes or in the middle, thanks for your advice!"

She crossed a redline and I don’t know how or if to proceed.,16225,0.95,1601,2020-07-01 17:45:25,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hj921t/wife_33f_and_i_38m_are_pretty_much_at_the_end_she/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hj921t/wife_33f_and_i_38m_are_pretty_much_at_the_end_she/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Throw away account for reasons. Sorry for the long post, there’s a lot to process and I don’t know where to start.

A few nights back, we met up with some of my friends from work to blow off steam from social isolation, it was our first time in a social setting since March - the beginning of COVID stay at home orders and also when we welcomed a son. We met at a brewery, then went back to another couple’s house. Lots of beer over a 3 hr period at the brewery, then we stayed at the other couples house until about 10:00 pm, or about 4 hours. Way too late, but we both got wrapped up in the moment. I cut myself off at about 9 and had maybe two beers in a 3 hour period before that. My wife was obliterated though. Not the safest decision, but I felt good enough and decided to drive home. Wife has work the next day, we have two kids, and we are an hour from home, safety, and frozen breast milk. I felt sober but would not have driven in other situations. She passes out in the car.
 
Around 11pm we arrive back to our place, she wakes drunk and disoriented and starts ordering me and our daughter around in our apartment garage. Blackout drinking episodes were a recurring issue with her earlier in our relationship but have not happened in about two years to this point. I ask her to just get in the house, it’s late and we need to get inside. She then brings out a laundry list of complaints she has about me and grabs our son. I remove our daughter from the situation, sending her back into the house. This angers her even more. Wife refuses to bring son back in the house; and then brings him back to the car and puts him in his car seat. There’s shouting on both sides, and afraid for my son- I threatened to call police (would have been disastrous for all involved but all I could think of doing). While she’s fiddling around on the driver side, I removed our son and brought him in the house. I proceed to feed him so he can go to sleep safely in his crib. She enters the house during his feeding and about 20 minutes after us and all hell breaks loose. 

She follows me throughout the house trying to take our son from me. Lots of shouting. Any distance I create is closed immediately. I again threaten to call police, but now my daughter is up and crying from a situation she doesn’t fully understand. Wife takes daughter into her room and slurs through speech I can’t understand while I am rocking our son in his room. When she leaves daughters room, I go in and apologize to daughter for everything that’s happening.  This sets wife off even more. As I try to change son's diaper on our couch she’s physically trying to pull me away from him. Despite that, I finish changing him then again try to create space by going to our room (small apartment not many places to go). She follows me, stumbling and shouting. I move through the room trying to stay away from her while holding our son. I refuse to hand him over to her. She then slaps me in the face, twice. 

It’s now about 1 am.
She’s threatening divorce and pushing every known verbal trigger. Completely frustrated at this point, I point out that I am his main care giver and these actions of hers would support me getting custody. She goes nuclear. After about 30 minutes she starts to calm enough that I at least let her touch her son. We continue to talk and I set him on the bed. She then snatched him up and walks around the apartment with him. In a ridiculous foot race around the apartment I’m begging her to put him back in his crib. Eventually she passes out in bed with him.

It’s now 2 am.
I wait ten minutes and pick up our son, put him in his crib, and lay down between it and the door in a blocking position. No sleep for me.

4 am, wife wakes up and tries to get him out of his crib. I talk her out. For the next two hours this will happen repeatedly. Wife alternates by demanding she and I talk and trying to pick up son. One of these are happening every 5-10 minutes. My repeated demands for her to give me space, stop talking, and let our son be are ignored. There’s nowhere I can go that she will not stop following and harassing me to talk to her, I can’t leave the apartment and the kids with her in this state but I don’t want to be near her at all.
It’s now 6 am. She sobers up, admits to her behavior, and apologize. Son wakes up and needs to eat. I let her do this and finally pass out, getting a little less than two hours.

There’s so much to process here that I don’t know how to proceed. She got physical with me, which is a very bright red line. I wasn't physically hurt, but it is emotionally damaging and that can't be put back in a bottle... I'm afraid it will only escalate on her end from here. There’s the threat she presented to our son while blackout drunk. The horror of my daughter seeing us shouting at each other. The complete disrespect for my need for time and distance. The litany of perceived slights and transgressions that she rolls out in every argument. The postpartum I’m very much sure she’s experiencing. 

The next day I demanded that she finally address her postpartum and that we needed extensive counseling for any chance that our relationship could survive. She sought a therapist for postpartum, joined a postpartum support group, found a separate marriage counselor for us both, and stated she would see a physician.

She’s still angry at me and focused on the fact I said I would have called the police, and that when she divorced me I would try to get custody. We argued again last night and she woke me up to argue again this morning. I’ve been sleeping on the couch because I can barely stand to be in the same room with her. She thinks an apology should have been enough, but I am devastated. 

After this event I’m not sure that therapy will even work. I was mostly catatonic and didn’t even eat for two days. I can’t talk to her, look her in the eye. Events from the night keep flashing through my head. She stated I can’t bring up anything regarding a threat to our son or CPS will be involved and we will both lose him. I need advice, how can I even begin to cope with all this?

Well, it was time for the next round of shots recently.

The kids came home, and kept mentioning “my poke” ...... 

So he asked me if they got vaccines and I came clean. I said yes, and told him they started last year.

I apologized for not telling him. He wasn’t happy.

No yelling, we talked more, and I explained the recent measles outbreaks nearby and expressed my concern for our kids.

All is well. No, we didn’t even raise voices. Yes we kissed and made up.

He understands I did things for the kids, and not against him.

Happy ending. Safe kids. Goodnight Reddit."

To preface: I started dating David (not real name obv) at the beginning of February.  Only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship I was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that I didn’t think much more about it. I fell hard and he did too. Things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and I can’t afford the place by myself). He and I have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and I have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time I’ve known him, so I didn’t really see any red flags there. Everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

Last week I came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and I played it off like I had no idea what he was doing. Fast forward to two days ago, I was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (I don’t care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. So when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, I quickly peeked through his search history. There was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly “teen”. I didn’t think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then I saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. “p*do pics” etc had been entered around 5 times. 

I quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, I had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. I couldn’t imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; I know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. So last night I peeked through his photos on his iPhone and was traumatized. There were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while I’d fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. I felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

A bit further up in his photos I discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. They all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. I was numb, i was angry, I was devastated, I couldn’t think and I was so disturbed at what I was witnessing. I have never seen CP in my life and I can’t get these horrible images out of my head. I scrolled pretty far up and didn’t really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the “petite teen” category. 

I guess I’m just posting here because I have no idea what else to do. I don’t know how to confront him and I know I must separate from him immediately but I’m terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and I don’t want to get in trouble. He must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  He practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. Not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially I am fucked by this. 


Please help Reddit, I feel so lost.

TLDR: I discovered CP on my boyfriends phone last night. Not sure how to proceed with anything."

A week ago I posted about the fact that I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and I wasn’t sure where to go from there. I was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! I think I was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

The following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. On Thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. I was so nervous I thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. He said that he’s sorry he wasn’t around much the days after but I was like no it’s fine I haven’t been home either, I knew it wasn’t on purpose. The vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

Anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said ‘like maybe you have a good soul if that’s a thing’ and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. And then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how I felt and he said ‘sorry I’m not trying to make this a big thing I just want to make sure you’re okay with everything and I want to make sure you feel respected’. I was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. I said that I was fine and that I felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. He said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we’re both happy living together whatever happens. I said I agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. Then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

It was all really sweet and nice and I think that whatever happens, he’s a respectful guy and we’ll communicate and we’ll be mindful of each other. At one point while we were talking he did say ‘sorry we’ve gotten off track, but I felt it was important we didn’t just discuss what happened, I wanted to get to know you a bit. It was a spontaneous thing so I’m glad you agree that we shouldn’t make a big deal out of it, and there’s no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. We’ll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that’s all we can do. And maybe we’ll have sex again too if you’re also up for that.’ 

God he’s great. Anyway, sorry it’s nothing too exciting but I had a few PM’s asking for an update so I wanted to let you know :) I’m really happy with the outcome and I’m sure we’ll be good friends at the very least."
gw6zq4,UPDATE- My boyfriend (24M) planned a road trip with me (24F) and his three friends. I have been uninvited.,16069,0.95,1049,2020-06-04 06:32:34,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gw6zq4/update_my_boyfriend_24m_planned_a_road_trip_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gw6zq4/update_my_boyfriend_24m_planned_a_road_trip_with/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I really hesitated in posting an update but I've received many messages enquiring about it. Thank you to everyone who gave advice! 

I confronted my boyfriend the day after posting this. Turns out, he didn't want to tell me that his friend's gf despises me. I was shocked at this as when we've been around her she's been nothing but nice to me. 

He showed me a private message she had sent him and she had demanded I didn't go on the trip. She also told him I was cheating on him. I was really shocked so I messaged her and she said that she was uncomfortable with her boyfriend being around me as I was really flirty around him the last time we hung out! That's absolutely not true. If I was being flirty, don't you think my boyfriend would have saw that? Plus, I have enough respect for my boyfriend that I absolutely would not do that ever. 

My boyfriend's told me stories in the past about how his friend's gf is very controlling/paranoid about other girls and won't even let him have female friends. I just didn't think she'd act that way with me. The only thing I can think of is when we last hung out I accidentally touched his leg as we were at a cramped booth together, so she's definitely reaching there. Also, during that night she had made a huge deal about him messaging another girl so much so we had to leave early as she demanded to go home. 

My bf kept what she had sent him to himself as he didn't want to cause any more riffs. He only has the two friends. He made the excuse up so as to not hurt my feelings. I get it, I do, but I'm an adult and I can handle someone disliking me. He thought he was sparing my feelings, but why he thought I would be more hurt by someone I barely know disliking me than from being essentially uninvited from our anniversary trip is beyond me. It feels as if he took her side in it. I know he hates confrontation and that's fine for him, but I want a boyfriend who can stand up for me. He doesn't even know her for god sake. I'm assuming he didn't want to lose his friend. His gf is very manipulative. 

To tell you the truth, I also thought he was planning on hooking up with his female friend. With two guys and two girls going how could I not think that? I'm not breaking up with him. We talked about it and he's not going on the trip. He's told his male friend the situation and he is likely going to break up with his gf as this isn't the first time she's did this.

If anything's unclear I apologise. It's a whole shitshow.





FINAL UPDATE: I broke up with him. I’ve been reading all the comments on both posts and came to the realisation that I’m unhappy and that’s likely not going to change unless I do something about it."
ionsrh,My (28M) girlfriend (32F) was laying on the couch and I saw a sent photo on her screen,16061,0.93,2791,2020-09-08 10:49:53,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ionsrh/my_28m_girlfriend_32f_was_laying_on_the_couch_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ionsrh/my_28m_girlfriend_32f_was_laying_on_the_couch_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Update below 

Hello all, this just happened about an hour ago so I'm trying to see if my thinking is in the right place

After supper tonight, my girlfriend of 4.5 yrs was having a nap on the couch, so I went to squeeze in a little Xbox before bed. Got off about 45 mins later and she was awake on the couch. I came over to sit down beside her and saw a sent photo(a selfie of her curled up on the couch) in a conversation, looked to be insta and I said offhand  ""that's a good angle can I see it?"" she locked the screen and said ""I was just trying to take one"" and I said ""well I saw you take one and send it let's see it"".

Now Im at about a 2 on the controlling scale, I have never asked to see her phone, never have any problems with any of her socializing etc, she never has an issue letting me use her phone/look or anything, she said no you can't see it. I said ""what do you mean, I just wanna see the pic"" and she got up to go to the bathroom and start doing laundry. I walked up to her and said ""you realize this is a massive red flag"" and she said ""I don't know what you want me to say, why would you think I would cheat on you""

I replied ""I never said anything about cheating, I just want to see the picture and the way youre behaving right now is extremely concerning. You've never had an issue with me doing any single thing on or with your phone or your laptop, and now you won't even open up your phone at all""

She said ""can you please just leave me alone so I can go shower"" I replied ""so you won't let me see what the picture was?"" and she said no

Now this is all well within her rights, but she has never acted like this whatsoever. There's never been any significant issues (few small things here and there of course) between us. She does have quite a few male friends but it's nothing I get jealous over 

Once she was done in the shower, she went straight to bed and I went in and said ""this is a very serious thing for me, if you want to deal with this right now we can, but otherwise this will destroy our relationship for me and there's a very good chance we will not be together by the time next month's rent is due"" and she just said ""I don't know what you want me to say, I didn't do anything wrong"" so I took my pillow and I am on the couch now. 

I've had issues in the past with ex's cheating on me, and she knows this. That's why it's been great that I've not had a reason to worry until this. Just a completely different person during that discussion and I have a very bad feeling in my gut and not sure what to do

Edit: she texted (yes texted) me from the bedroom, saying ""I was just in the bathroom for 1 minute looking at my back on my phone, I didn't want you to make fun of me for looking at my back"". This has literally 0 to do with what happened and seems like she has a completely terrible excuse and timeline of events. I've texted a few friends to see if I can arrange something since things, barring a progressive discussion tomorrow, are not looking good






UPDATE: For everyone messaging me about an update, here it is.

I went into work and told my boss we ran into some possible issues the night before, and I felt like I needed to go home to address them, so I did. I went home and we hashed it out. She didn't delete the messages, and showed me. It was just as she said. She said she sort of freaked out as she felt I was just coming at her with cheating accusations, she used to have an emotionally abusive boyfriend (I've known this from the start) so she just sort of went in lockdown mode. I believe her, I've had no reason to think she would lie to me. During this conversation other issues that we have with one another in the relationship came out, and we hashed those out too. Overall we both have a lot of work to do on ourselves and for us as a couple. 

As for where the ""looking at my back"" part came in, she was in the bathroom just before everything happened I guess, taking pictures of her back. She showed me said pictures, and she brought up ""why would you think I'm cheating"" during the altercation as she thought I knew she was in there, and that I thought she was sending nudes. 

For everyone messaging and replying saying how controlling and insecure I am, I get how this post came across that way but it's just not true. I've never asked to see any conversations, snaps, DMs etc in any way other than a ""whats so and so up to"". I don't control who she talks to, where she goes, who she hangs out with, nothing of that sort. It's just not me. Frankly I don't really care, since she's coming home at the end of the night to me. But when you're with someone for 4.5 years, living together for 3, you know what normal behavior is and what abnormal behavior is, and this was definitely abnormal. I'm sure a good portion will just think ""get a load of this guy"" but you're all entitled to your opinion. Like I said earlier, we both have things to work on, and that includes I guess trying to mentally get over the baggage we both have from previous relationships.

All in all, the messages were nothing to worry about, I overreacted because of the strange behavior she showed due to a previous relationship, and we were both able to bring up things we'd like the other to work on. Perhaps I'm a fool and just got swindled but as of right now I have no reason to believe there is any suspect shit going on."
j2jmsg,How do I (32f) tell my son (5y.o.) that his father isn't safe to be around alone?,16037,0.95,561,2020-09-30 15:58:52,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j2jmsg/how_do_i_32f_tell_my_son_5yo_that_his_father_isnt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j2jmsg/how_do_i_32f_tell_my_son_5yo_that_his_father_isnt/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"So I divorced my sons father after it became apparently I was a walking sex doll he could use for booze money. No matter how many times I tried to talk with him, how many times his own family tried or how many chances I gave him, he never tried to change. He won't admit he has a drinking problem that still persists to this day. 

After a horrible mistake that could've cost my sons life (drinking and driving) he is no longer allowed to see our son alone. Ever. I have and have had full complete custody of our son since the divorce as the judge deemed him unfit. My ex MIL (God bless this woman) watches my son overnights a couple nights a week and does his schooling (remote learning, she's a retired teacher). She used to let her son stay the night there until she woke up to find he'd left the stove on after cooking my son sausages for breakfast. When she went to confront him, he was passed out and smelled of alcohol. He's now no longer allowed to stay past 8 pm at her house. 

My son is so, so very innocent in all of this. He is understandably upset because daddy can't stay anymore, and I simply don't know how to tell him why. I don't want to ruin his relationship with his father (who seems hellbent on doing that himself) but he needs to know SOMETHING to try and understand what's going on. 

I plan on getting him a specialized child therapist but with covid right now and him being high risk, I just can't do it at the moment. So until then, any advice at all would be really appreciated.

UPDATE: Holy crap, I did not expect this to blow up the way it did. 

I've talked with my son, and told him that daddy is very sick in his head but he loves him very, very much. I explained it's been like this since before he was born (it got worse when I got pregnant) and that it doesn't mean he loves him any less. 

For anyone wondering, I hold no ill will towards my ex. I did for awhile, I'll admit, but therapy has helped immensely and while I have no love for him anymore, I do want him to get better for our son. My father was much like this, and unfortunately for me it ended very, very badly about ten years ago. 

Thank you everyone, so so much, for all of your help and advice. I might not be able to respond to all of the comments but I'll read them and appreciate the help."

He uses a lot of different apps to meet and sleep with new people and has always complained that he has nowhere to bring those acquaintances to. 
I‘m often away to visit family and everytime I come back I have a weird feeling that someone has been in my house. 
Today I came back after celebrating NYE and my apartment just smelled weird even though I cleaned and let air in before I left. It never smells this way. Also, my bathrooms sink was wet and the fountain was wet too. 
In the kitchen, a big kitchen wipe was SOAKING wet. I didnt leave my apartment like this and I‘m grossed out by the thought of having foreign people in my bed... I told him I need my keys and he told me he would give them to me tmw.. 
also, he has joked about bringing hook-ups to my apartment before but I quickly shut him down. He also showed my texts to another friend before where he jokingly asked „(..) or should I just bang him in avocadobaum‘s apartment lol“
Am I overreacting? Or over suspicious?
He is a preetty good liar so that‘s why I didnt straight-up ask him.
UPDATE:

I confronted him about it via text and he came over an brought the keys, looking disappointed af.. he couldn‘t believe that I would expect something like this from him and asked me „what kind of trashy person do you think I am?“.. 
he also showed me (i told him no need but he did anyways) text messages with the guys he talked to yesterday night while I was away and they basically just texted normal stuff. He also showed phone calls he had at night. 
He kept bringing up how disappointed he was in me even though I just lost my trust in him and that‘s why I think/though that way..  I literally feel like I went crazy or something because I remember so well not using that kitchen cloth, and even the heater in the living room was on full mode when I got back but I left it at mid-heat. He said stuff like „well it wasnt me, idk who it was but just lock your doors I guess“
I regret confronting him and feel shitty now tbh. At one point I started crying and telling him I love him so much as a friend but I just lost my trust and idk how to get it back. But at least I got my keys back I guess..

Update #2:
Thank you so much for all the answers and especially safety tips. Also thanks to all the people who offered to pay for the change of the locks! 
I will take everything into consideration and just for info: I asked him about my keys the first time at around 21 o‘clock and confronted him at 12. I don‘t think that he got it copied during that time period and also don‘t think that he would repeat what he did (if he did it) after this fight. (Still gonna change the locks when I get paid)
My landlord does not have keys to my apartment. And I checked my router, couldn’t find anything suspicious for the time I was away. 
During this whole thing I realized that I wasn‘t only mad at him for potentially banging in my flat but also because of other things that happened in the past. I lost my trust waay before all this but didn‘t want to accept it and now I do and I told him. He didn‘t really know what to answer because we had already discussed the things from the past, and just told me to tell him if I‘m going through something rough (I‘m not).
Obviously the story is way longer than I originally thought but to conclude: I‘ll never know if he did it and
for the future, I‘ll not be naive and give my keys to my  friend who cannot bang at his place."

Last update for a while: Thanks to all of you for your support. I can't even express how wonderful all of your advice and kind words have been. I'm having a hard time getting back to all of you as this has kind of blown up, so I'm just gonna have to stop for now. I'll post another thread with an update as needed. Take care

(Original story below the dotted line)

I met with my lawyer this morning and she was great. She gave me a lot of confidence that I felt was draining away from me throughout the week as I waited to confront. I also had a good friend that was my rock throughout the week, and I will never be able to thank him enough.

I ended up confronting my wife right after the meeting with the lawyer. I refused to give up any of my evidence. I just said ""I know about the other guy, I need you to talk about it."" I just kept repeating that line while she went through crocodile tears and confusion about what I was talking about. It was SO fucking hard not giving up any of that information. But I knew that I had all the power in that situation.

In the end she never confessed. I basically moved the conversation from there by saying ""Well, it doesn't matter if you admit to what I already know or not, because the sexting that you did last year was enough to destroy any trust I had in you. And I can no longer live like this,."" From there she just kind of shut down, and became pretty docile, and never brought back up this ""outrageous thing I was falsely accusing her of"".

We pretty quickly moved into business-like details about what to do in the short term. Her dad came over and picked her up and gave me a hug, and said ""let us know if you need anything"". I fucking teared up right at that moment...

I'm not letting my guard down yet, because anything can happen, but I think things may work out for the better for everyone involved.

I cannot thank everyone here on Reddit enough for your thoughts, jabs, pearls of wisdom, and funny comments. You all gave me some serious wake-up calls and support. I am forever in your debt.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm sorry in advance for the length of this...

I (35m) think that my wife (33f) is cheating on me, and has been for many years. We've been together for 14 years, we've been married for almost 10 years, and we have a 5 year old daughter together.

Incident #1:

When my wife and I were in college (where we first started dating), we had an incident where she had some really sexually graphic texts from a guy we both knew from school. She even had classes with him. I confronted her about the texts. I definitely didn't handle it well, and basically accused her straight out of the gate as cheating on me without realizing there were some possible outs for her. One of those outs was that she claimed that they were just some pervy texts that she got from this guy out of the blue, and that if I had paid any attention when I was snooping through her phone, that she hadn't actually responded to them. At the time, I conceded that I may have overlooked that possibility, and I had overreacted. She apologized to me for not mentioning to me that some guy was hitting on her like that, and I apologized for overreacting and for snooping. We moved on from there.

Incident #2:

Fast forward to this last year. My daughter, wife, and I are at the gas station. I can tell my wife is kind of distant and detached from the interactions my daughter and I are having. I notice she's glued to her phone as well. The gas fill for our car is on the passenger side, and I have the rear passenger door open so I can tickle my daughter while I wait for the car to fill up. I'm really suspicious of what my wife is doing at this point, so I decide that I'm going to take a look over my wife's shoulder from the backseat at what it is she's so caught up in. Turns out she is actively/in-the-moment sexting some guy. Like, words/descriptions/acts that very much seem like they've been doing this a while (texting) and looking back with 20/20 hindsight, I'm fairly certain they had been fucking as well. Also, all the shit she was texting was super graphic shit, stuff that she NEVER used with me either in dirty talk or when we got intimate...and I know this next admission is pathetic and that it shouldn't matter more than anything else, but that fact that she wanted to share in these acts with this man instead of me really fucking hurt. Probably just my pride talking, but it is what it is...

So, fast forward 10 mins when we get home, and I have to suffer through smiling during dinner and the whole nighttime ritual of getting our daughter to bed so as not to cause a scene by blowing up at my wife for what I had seen her texting. Honestly, that was probably a blessing, because it allowed me to collect my thoughts before confronting her. I end up telling my wife what I saw at the gas station, and right off the bat she tries to play dumb, ""What are you talking about?!"" ""Honey, you're making no sense."" I told her to not play dumb with me, and I recited some of the texts that I could remember back to her to prove that I saw what I saw. She then goes on to admit that it was a mistake, but that it was 100% nothing physical, and that she was really sorry. She admitted that the guy was a work colleague.

We talked a lot that night about why she felt she needed to be doing that. A lot of it boiled down to her feeling depressed and lonely. We talked about strategies that we could invoke at home, things that we BOTH could change, to help mend the rift. I guess things felt kind of ""OK"" after that. But it felt like that damage to our trust was already done, and I don't think I've ever really recovered. Even that seemingly small moment of infidelity (assuming that was only texts) was just such a fucking hammer to my heart. Ever since that incident from last year, I've been waking up every day as a lesser version of my former self. My emotions and propensity to feel anything have been severely muted. Interacting with my daughter is about the only thing that gets me back close to a baseline of how I remember my former self...But beyond those precious moments, I'm just a walking, grayed out zombie that puts on a good face for pretty much everything for my day-to-day (going to work, interacting with my wife, etc).

Most recent incident #3:

Now fast forward to yesterday. My wife has been gone on a week long ""work"" trip to the East coast (we are West coast). I actually had zero suspicions or justifiable reasons to be worried for this trip, because things had been going pretty well between us, and she hadn't really given off any indicators of suspicious behavior. But, my first clue was that when she arrived at her destination, she ""couldn't get the WiFi working for FaceTime"". And.......this stayed true for the entirety of her trip....First of all, FaceTime works on cellular data just fine (which we have a ridiculous amount of). I explained that to her, without much of a response. Second, I know that if I were gone for a week from MY family, it would be my biggest fucking priority to get FaceTime up and running so that I could see my family's faces every time I called to visit (which would be every single night...which brings me to the next point). She called us in the evening to say goodnight maybe two times out of the seven days that she was gone. Based on previous trips she's had, this was REALLY strange. Normally she is like clockwork touching in with us to share her day and to hear from us about our day (AND, again, always on FaceTime). I asked her about that, and she claimed that she was just too tired in the evenings to get back to us. Also, in the past, if she was away me/home, she would always text me goodnight and that she loved me, even if we had previously chatted moments earlier on FaceTime or via phone call. For this recent trip, she never texted me once.

So, when she got back, my radar was on high alert. Now, I don't feel good about this next part, but when she went to sleep that night, I checked her travel bag to see if my suspicions were correct. Sure enough, to my surprise, she keeps this little red book as a diary in her work bag. I open it up, and there is a date marked 2/9/15. Turns out she'd started writing a poem on that day about our daughter, who had just been born the previous fall. Okay, ""That's really sweet!"" I say to myself, and I start to feel bad about my snooping...Flip to the next page, and there's a new entry. There's no date, but it's written sequentially right after the aforementioned poem so I know that I describe here was an entry that came after our daughter being born. This non-dated entry starts off with her describing how much she longs for this specific person (doesn't give his name). She goes on to talk about how she can't stop thinking about him. Every man she sees reminds her of him. She talks about how she never really intended for things to go very far, but ""that one night that started in the bar, and ended up going upstairs"" just felt too right to not be something meaningful. She goes on to say that she doesn't feel bad about making that decision in regard to how it impacts her ""other life"". She describes how she thinks maybe her ""other life"" was the mistake. This goes on for pages. That entry ends with her making peace with herself that he moved on from her, and it was time for her to forget about him. I am assuming that her ""other life"" our daughter and me.

There was only one more entry after that previous one. I took pictures of it and have typed it out here in it's entirety: ""I'm laughing to myself because I haven't opened this book in over two years and here I am sitting in his bed. In his room at his home. Still feeling angst over so many of the same things. I'll go home after having a week with him and I'll be asking the same questions. Is he ever going to call again after? Was it so stupid to go on this trip? So funny how I thought we'd never speak again and look where I am. We worked together, we talked almost every day, and he was there for me as a friend. Now here I am. And back with questions. Why were we so hot and cold those first couple of days and then just tapered off? Maybe he's doing that moral compass wrestling and after I leave we'll never speak again. This trip was probably a bad idea. But we had a lot of fun. And he did say he'd been looking forward to it. He missed me, he wanted this, I know that. I wish he would just tell me he wants me, just me, and always me. It's like we dance around things because he still wants us to have this thing happening despite the rest of my life and I just don't want to talk about that, to the point that I'm lying, and I hate lying to him. But meanwhile, every tender moment I have with him is so precious I can't believe it. I couldn't imagine we'd actually be snuggling on the couch and there we were.""

I have't slept since reading that last full entry. I haven't confronted her yet, either. It's been almost 48 hours now without sleep, and I'm just an emotional wreck. I just don't know how to handle this situation. I guess I've gotten so good at wearing this zombie mask ever since incident #2 happened, that I've been able to limp through the last couple of days, but it's getting really really hard to be around her...

I hopped online and read some guides on how to deal with infidelity, and most of the guides mentioned therapy. So I'm going to look into that tomorrow.

Just filing for divorce isn't so simple. My wife has a serious seizure disorder that is uncontrolled. She can't tell when they're happening, so that puts herself and possibly others (small kids especially...our daughter to be exact) in danger. I mention this as it pertains to custody. Imagine she's making dinner for her and my daughter one evening, and she has a seizure near the stove top, and the house catches on fire? Well, the only adult in the house is lying on the floor unconscious.  Or what if my daughter has a medical emergency, but then my wife has a seizure due to the stress of the situation? These are very real possibilities, and ones that I fear could happen if she got custody in any way. Some of those examples aren't too far off from other real life incidents we've had over the years due to her seizure disorder. She obviously can't drive. Would this factor into a custody dispute? I mean, our daughter is starting kindergarten in a month, how could my wife transport her?

I don't know what I'm looking for with this whole rambling post...maybe just assurance that her gas-lighting isn't working? That what I've described isn't the workings of an overly paranoid mind? I feel like one minute I'm ready to file for divorce, and then the next I want to try to salvage things for the sake of our daughter, and just to avoid the awful mess that will be made of all three of our lives if we end up separating....

Here's some other logistical details that seem important for anyone who's managed to read this far:

\- We own a house together (have a mortgage).

\- I make about (deleted) per year. She makes around (deleted) per year.

\- We have significant investments that we have joint control over that were given to us by her Dad. They total somewhere in the range of (deleted) in stocks and bonds.

\- I'm on wonderful terms with her parents and her family in general. I've always been that son-in-law that was there for everyone to lend help no matter how small or large.

\- All of her immediate family is right here where we live.

\- I have zero family support from my side where we live. My nearest FRIEND is 1-1/2 hours away...

Thanks for any help in advance.

Edit/update: I left work today in order to start lining things up. I have a lawyer lined up for this Friday, that’s the earliest I could find in my area. It’s just a consultation, so I’m not sure what to expect from that one meeting alone?

Thanks everyone for all of your pearls and especially your daggers. I definitely needed some other perspectives. I know it seems unbelievable that I could go this long, but I’ve been seriously gas lit for years now...just conditioned to it. It’s also a character flaw of mine to want to see the best in people...

I’m just so fucking scared of the unexpected...god dammit. I just hope she admits to it.

Is there any way she can twist this around on me? Like invasion of privacy? We are WA state, so I can’t record me confronting her without her consent..."
ixv0rh,UPDATE - I [26/F] haven't seen my ‘husband’ [28/M] in 3 years. His sister [27/F] invited me to her wedding.

Thank you to everyone who replied to my original post. Your comments were very helpful and forced me to acknowledge I had a much bigger problem than just the wedding. 

I tried to contact my husband the day after I posted the original. Like always, his assistant intercepted and told me my husband was away and if I had a message for him, I should send it through him. I ended up giving him an ultimatum of either meeting with me before the wedding or neither my son nor I would attend. I expected him to ignore it, but he reached out to me a few hours later and we arranged to meet a week later.

The meeting went fine. It was very awkward at first, but I got out most of what I wanted to say. He agreed we couldn’t keep doing things the way we were doing them but claimed he had no use for a divorce so if I wanted one, I should file. This annoyed me because he said he would file when we split so we argued over it for a while. He ended up reluctantly agreeing to going to therapy so we could have a healthier co-parenting relationship, but we haven’t started yet because of his schedule. He also agreed to handle all matters about our son personally instead of through his assistant from now on (He’s managed to stick to this so far). He also spent a few hours with our son at my place which would normally never happen. My son was happy so even if it was a little awkward for us, it was worth it for him. 

The wedding was last week, and it was a beautiful event. I’m glad I went. My son was ecstatic the whole day. Even a week later he keeps saying it was his absolute favorite day. We did end up sitting next to each other and it was surprisingly nice. His family were on their best behavior and my MIL/FIL apologized for how they treated me during the early days of our separation which was unexpected but welcome. 

Things are obviously far from being fixed but I think we can work towards a better co-parenting relationship for our son’s sake.

TL;DR – I ended up meeting with my husband before the wedding like the comments suggested. We talked and agreed to try therapy to have a better co-parenting relationship. The wedding was nice and my son had a lot of fun, which is what is important."
ey0g9k,UPDATE: I (21F) think my cousin (32M) tried to sexually assault me but I'm not sure.,15965,0.89,879,2020-02-03 08:46:27,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ey0g9k/update_i_21f_think_my_cousin_32m_tried_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ey0g9k/update_i_21f_think_my_cousin_32m_tried_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ewz3oa/i_21f_think_my_cousin_32m_tried_to_sexually/

A lot has happened in the last 24 hours. I don't know where to start but here it is. This is going to be long. First of all, I'm really really sorry guys. You're not going to like what you read. I received so much support here on reddit but unfortunately, this was not the case in real life. I'm sorry if I have disappointed anyone.

The first person I talked to about this was my mom. I told her what happened and she did NOT take it well. She didn't understand what I was saying. She said I probably misunderstood his intentions. She said she had told him to keep an eye on me and that she was sorry if it led to me being uncomfortable but he's a nice person. She said the smoothie story was far-fetched. I'm overthinking. Being paranoid etc. She said she trusts him and even though the thigh touching was creepy, NOTHING happened. In the end, I was fine. If he really wanted to rape me, he would have raped me. He would've used force. He didn't do anything and just went to bed, that proofs that he's not a bad guy. She said we were not going to meet him that much anyway. It would be better if I just let this go. I should mention that she's Asian. Victim blaming is not unheard of in third world countries.

I was really really upset by how she dismissed me so I had to talk to my dad. I love my dad so so much. He was furious this happened. He stood by me. He comforted me. I was ready to be dismissed, but he told me it was definitely creepy and you have no idea how relieved I felt. I love my dad. He was supporting me and was just being such an amazing dad. I was always more close with my mom. I can't believe my mom didn't believe me but my dad did.

We decided to call his wife and let her know first. His wife was furious with ME. She didn't believe any of it. She accused me of lying. She said she knew what I was doing. She said she already knew I was trying to seduce him or something. I don't know what my cousin has told her but she refuses to listen to me. She said she didn't want to talk on the phone, said it was better if we talked directly and then hung up.

So we drove for four hours and went to my cousin's place. By this time, my aunt and uncle knew about this too and my aunt called me to ask me what I was trying to do, accused me of trying to break her son's family etc. 

My cousin was calm and polite and just the perfect fucking person even when I asked him what he had put in the smoothie. I told his wife about my suspicions. But my cousin appeared confused and concerned. He asked me if I was alright. He apologized repeatedly for causing misunderstandings, appeared genuinely remorseful that he had made me uncomfortable. He apologized to my dad many times. His wife kept saying he didn't need to apologise because he didn't do anything wrong but he calmly explained that he was only making sure I was alright that night because I had been crying just before and he was worried about me. 

He denied touching my thigh and said that he was joking when he said he gave me a massage. He was so convincing. I wanted everyone to see the flaws in his explanation and I wanted his wife to understand that I wasn't lying. I felt humiliated, disgusted and like a homewrecker. I was desperate and asked him questions to make him stumble. But he didn't stumble even once. He was thorough and detailed in his explanations for his behaviour. He raised many points that made me look like a complete fucking idiot. 

He said he didn't know my parents would go out that night. Neither did I. It was an emergency. If he didn't know beforehand that my parents were going to go out and that we would be alone then he wouldn't have had time to procure the drugs. 

""You're saying I put something in the smoothie. How did I get drugs so quickly? I didn't go anywhere that day. I was with you all day."" I had no answer to this question. I just said maybe he already had drugs with him and he laughed, asking why he would keep drugs with him. I asked if he takes any prescribed drugs because someone on reddit said that could be a possibility. He said no. His wife also confirmed it. Though they could lying, I don't know.

In the end, he said the same thing my mom said. If he wanted to, he could've sexually assaulted me. He's stronger than me. He could knock me out and rape me if he wanted to. He didn't. Nothing happened. I have no proof. He said there are actual victims of sexual assault and rape out there. I shouldn't be using the term so lightly. I shouldn't be lying about something this serious.

My dad told him to stay away from me and that we would go to the police. His wife started crying, asking me why I was doing this, why I was ruining her family. She has two kids she needs to take care of. She asked me how I could be so heartless and cruel.

We're back home now. I'm completely fucking done with this. I don't want anything to do with this incident. I'm sorry, guys. I know you wanted me to be bold but I can't be that and I'm sorry. My family hates me. No one believes me. My mom thinks I'm lying for attention. I have no proof. I was not raped. If I go to the police, my relationship with my family is going to be completely destroyed. Everyone will know about this and I don't know what I'm going to do. Thank you for all the support. I'll be okay. At least I have my dad with me. He's my only support at the moment. He's with me 100%. I don't have any proof and I don't know what will happen but I have a lot to decide. I don't know what I will do yet, but thank you to everyone here who supported me. I love you guys so much."
ehlwqh,Son (M28) Devastated by death of Girlfriend (F29) during Childbirth.

They were together for 6 years and had started planning their family (they never felt like they wanted to get married). He is understandably taking everything very hard. Him and his son have moved back in with us (his father and myself) and we are completely happy to have them - he said his house had too many painful memories, and we also feel that it's better for him to be with us so we can help & support him during this horrible time.

He's an amazing father to his son, and after two and a half months off (paternity leave) has returned to work and is functioning well in that aspect. However, we are worried about his state of mind. He has been in therapy which initially helped very much but he seems to have hit a standstill over the last 2 months. He recently expressed how he thought everything was his fault because he's the one who got her pregnant in the first place. We tried to reassure him that it wasn't but he just brushed it off and said he knew that but he still felt that way.

Obviously I know there's not going to be any miracle cure for this, and he'll probably be affected by it for a long long time, but is there any way we can help him with this process? We are very concerned but have never dealt with anything even remotely like this before so any advice would be appreciated."

I am not a bodybuilder, however he is a shorter man and *very* skinny. Because of this, our contrast looks more significant and we’ve both always been aware of this. We’ve talked about it plenty of times before and he’s never been distraught over it. Yes, I’ve had my suspicions that maybe our size differences have given him some thoughts in the past, but I’ve never pressed him on it.

Because he’s so skinny, and he’s aware of his health, he’s talked to me about gaining weight. I’ve been helping him try and gain weight at home and have even gone with him to speak to doctors about getting something for this. He has always given up on the progress very early for reasons I always assumed were forgetfulness or laziness. *I’m now starting to question if it was also issues with his self esteem insecurities that caused him to stop all the time.* I never pushed him on this ‘cause I didn’t want to force him to do anything

Another thing that I’m now thinking about is how he’s never wanted to work out with me at the gym even though he’s told me he’s wanted to get fit. I’m not stupid, I know being seen with me at the gym might’ve made him uncomfortable. We’ve talked to each other about our insecurities and worries like we all do. He always said it’s not being seen together, it’s just being seen in the gym in general. He’d say things like, “even before us I was too embarrassed to go to the gym’ or “oh, I don’t wanna embarrass you.”

Okay, this is common among tons of people, so I believed him. So we’d work out at home, and same thing happens here like with the weight gain, just gives up. The problem now is that, I’m starting to suspect that there’s some deep rooted issues he has, and it’s all ‘cause of the family dinner.

We had dinner at his family’s house and this was the first time they have met me. Nothing was out of the ordinary until the questions about my body started to fly. Nbd, I get them all time. I’m tall, he’s short. My muscles are more visible, his aren’t. Whatevs.

But the next few days, he was visiting his family and talking on the phone. Turns out, they’ve been harassing him, making fun of him, making fun of me, our bodies, everything. I’m dead fucking sure this is fueling his insecurities. I found all of this because I caught him crying on the phone arguing with his mom. She is telling him to dump me. Saying things like the cousins or whatever are all talking shit. Guys in his family are making fun of his body and mine. Saying all sorts of disgusting things.

He’s so hurt. I know the easiest thing is to just ignore them, but he’s always been close with his family so that’s not going to help him. Stuff like that for people like my boyfriend is always easier said than done.

How do I help him? I want to help him be happy with himself, with his body, *and with me*.  Is it selfish for me to think about myself, too??? I won’t lie, I’m worried of losing him because ive seen the texts, and his mom is demanding that he leave me."

Im not in the greatest mindset and i dont really have anybody to talk to, so im turning to you guys here. Also, throwaway because they both browse reddit.  


So ive been dating this girl for about 2 years now (We'll call her X), we also work together. My bestfriend (Who we'll call Z). Everything was going pretty well up until a few weeks ago. They would get off work at the same time and go to another bar with mutuals to have a couple drinks. Which would then lead to them hanging out at his house without me (i work mornings, they work nights so i cant really stay out too late). I trusted him with my heart that nothing would happen, so of course i was cool with it. Couple weeks go by, X revealed to me that she had ""feelings"" for him, but promised me nothing happened between them and she will work on herself and us. Heartbroken and confused, i brushed it off as a hit to the relationship, but i wanted to push onward and let her redeem herself. Fast forward to a couple days ago, Z tells me that they had both went out a couple times a week to the bar and X had slept over on the couch a few times, and she had been trying to make a move on my bestfriend. Of course i trusted his word over hers, as i have known him for almost half of my life and weve been through alot. So today at work, one our mutual friends who is pretty close to Z revealed to me that Z and X had also traded nudes and cuddled on the couch. Z had told him out of guilt one day when he was almost blackout drunk. I approached X as i am getting ready to leave while shes getting ready to go aswell, that i cant trust her anymore, and left before i said anything i would regret. Dumbfounded and heartbroken yet again as neither X or Z had told me the truth and i had to find out from a MUTUAL friend what really went down. Im left with with NO trust left with my bestfriend and my potential Ex and i dont know where to start. Shes blowing up my phone and keeps insiting she loves me, and avidly shifts blame between her being drunk, and her being stupid, and i keep ignoring it. I dont want to talk to her or anything. I want to talk to z but i dont even know if i can talk to him, let alone look him in the eyes.   


The 2 people im supposed to trust the most in my life right now and they single-handedly destroyed that in a fraction of the time ive spent building it.   


Im incredibly lost right now and i dont even know where to start.

Update: This blew the hell up and ill try to get back to everybody, but i just want you guys to know how much this means to me. Reddit has once again prevailed as an amazing community, and i really really really want to thank you, individually. Advice i was not able to obtain at the moment has been provided by you guys. Your kind words of encouragement and support means more to me than a thousand hugs from anybody i know in person. I appreciate the fuck out of that. If i was more rich i would buy everybody a round just for taking a few moments out of your life.

*!!EDIT EDIT UPDATE EDIT AS OF JUNE 2020!!*

Yeah now that ive taken the time to heal from the situation, FUCK them. Havent spoken to my ex best friend in 3 months, and i dragged out the relationship with the ex gf for about an extra month so i could take the living fucking advantage of her before i ended it. Fast forward to today, been single for about 2 months now? And life couldnt be any awesomely better. I love each and every one of you guys :)"

* isolation, through which abuse thrives,

* fewer opportunities for social support,

* fewer public venues and events through which victims may be able to seek help or flee, and

* close confinement with an abuser.

Many abusive partners are also using COVID-19 as an opportunity to further gaslight, control, and isolate potential abuse survivors by:

* withholding and limiting food,

* withholding medical supplies,

* preventing a potential survivor from accessing medical care,

* confiscating a potential survivor's devices, preventing communication with advocates and hotlines, and

[final update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7p8s0/final_update_my_gf_27_is_pregnant_and_i_25_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Just to clear up some things:

1. We were using protection on both of our ends. Well at least I know I was. Now I'm not sure if she was really on the pill.

2. If I could've gotten a vasectomy earlier trust me I would. I was getting refused for years. 

3. I didn't try pressuring her into getting an abortion. I asked because I wrongfully assumed she would want to get one. When she said no I didn't press it further. I wouldn't do that.

She's really trying to make me stay and it seems like I don't have much of a choice in the matter. She told her family and they are very interesting people. Her mom and dad have been calling me to berate me. Her brother is threatening me and has a history of violence. They all showed up to our place to come yell at me.

I'm diagnosed with GAD and also get panic attacks which kind of plays into why I don't want kids. This situation was already making me anxious and now with her family at my throat it's not helping. I don't know if she purposefully did this knowing it would cause me extreme anxiety. I know that they won't leave me alone no matter what or where I go they will harass me. 

I honestly thought signing away my rights if possible would be the best for all of us. Kid included. I truly do not think that I will be a good father. My dad was in my life but he wasn't a good one. He was very abusive to me and my mother. He broke my arm on purpose out of anger when I was 14. I would've rather him not be in my life at all. Maybe I'm projecting. Either way it doesn't matter because it doesn't seem like I'm leaving and my girlfriend seems to be very happy with that. She's already talking about a nursery and stuff. 

I know I come off as a shitty person. It's not just me trying to be a deadbeat and not take responsibility. We discussed not wanting kids our whole relationship so it felt like I was being blindsided (?). What if I pass my anxiety down to this kid? I feel like that's unfair to them. It's not easy to deal with. What if I'm alone with it and have a panic attack? I just hope I don't fuck this kid up. This is why I didn't want this. I'm not made for fatherhood. 

My girlfriend knew this we discussed this constantly. I guess she changed her mind a long time ago and didn't tell me or she was lying so I didn't leave. I'm not sure but she was the one that brought it up so it must've been true at first."

UPDATE #2 ON THE BOTTOM

UPDATE #3 ON THE BOTTOM

So I'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that I had since I was kid. 

She always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

But to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. He has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. Even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

When we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but I couldnt cuz I really love my snake.

Well now I came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

When I confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

I find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and I doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

I dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

I wanna confront her about it but I dont wanna seem like Im being petty

EDIT: When I brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying I always do this?? Idek what she even means by this



UPDATE: she dmd me this (im out rn) 
https://imgur.com/a/PSBp9l6

UPDATE 2: I went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. Were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

UPDATE 3: Didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and I found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. Well with the gf, I am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now I have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

It *really* fucked me up, I won't lie. Not just bc it was an assault and by default traumatic, but also because the whole thing was very similar to something that happened to me when I was a kid and it triggered some really deep seated trauma from that as well. 

It's fucked how I view sex. A few days after it happened my partner tried to initiate sex with me and I just burst into tears and couldn't do it. She was sympathetic, but naturally annoyed that she was being fulfilled sexually and had to take things into her own hands. I'm not that bad any more, I can push through and make myself do it now, but I have to kind of mentally disengage to be able to cope. 

I get why my partner is frustrated, I do. We've gone from having a normal healthy sex life to me being shit in bed. She's upset because sexual empowerment/fulfillment is a big deal for her and I'm just not giving it to her any more. I understand all of that. I'm trying my best to work through this shit, but it's difficult, you know? I trusted the people who assaulted me, and I still have to see one of them pretty regularly, and it took a real toll on my mental wellbeing. I just have this block now, which I'm finding I'm moreso chipping away at rather than busting through. 

Because I'm no longer any good for her in bed, my partner has told me she wants to open the relationship. She wants to go and have sex with other guys cause I'm just not fulfilling her any more. I won't lie. This is crushing for me. No hate to people who are poly/in open relationships. But the idea of it isn't for me. I told her I don't want that and she's said I'm being really selfish and not conidering her wants/needs and that it's not fair that her sex life should suffer because I'm going through some stuff. I feel like she's right, but I'm still really really upset about it. I just don't know how to handle this. Can anybody help?"
d2trgo,I (F25) found out my fiance (M27) is with me for money/family business,15666,0.96,1561,2019-09-11 23:00:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d2trgo/i_f25_found_out_my_fiance_m27_is_with_me_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d2trgo/i_f25_found_out_my_fiance_m27_is_with_me_for/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"To preface. My family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. Thus I am a trustfund baby. I try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
I met my fiance Mark when I was 20 and working as a waitress.

We began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

Now mark is not poor. He is upper middle class. And while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. I thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. What I want to say is that I never had the impression that Mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

In the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and I stood up for him and fought with my dad. They came to love and accept him. When Mark graduated Dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

Sunday I was supossed to work in the evening and I was going to stay with my sister. But I got a fever and was basically just non functioning so I stayed home. Instead of staying in our bedroom I made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (I didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so I just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

Mark came home when I was fast asleep and I was woken up by loud voices in our garden. I pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark Was there with a few friends. Just as I wanted to say hello I noticed that they were talking about me.

His friend kept laughing and calling Mark ""the man!"". Then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. Then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""Jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". Mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and I am free"".

At this moment I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. I kept hearing them calling me trust fund Barbie and stupid and so on. I didn't know what to do so I just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. I texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

I haven't returned home and just told Mark that I was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
My sister has been really worried but I just feel so ashamed about everything. My family was right mark is a gold digger and I fell for it. Even if I tell my family what happened I have no proof. My father can't fire him just because he is a dick. As far as I know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him I think. I just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

Edit : we are non us. Mark wasnt talking about anything else. He has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it I helped pay it off. There is no way he wasn't talking about me

Edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. I opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. We have called up dad and I will talk to him tommorow. I will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

Edit3: some questions have come up.

I don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. I mostly uber arround

I worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and I don't anylonger

I don't work for my father I am a company shareholder and I have to go to the general Quartal meetings but I don't work for him.

I am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. It was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. By pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

Last edit : I am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. Guess what. It's not fucking funny. You don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. You don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. I don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but I don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. It was deeply hurt full."

Thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. I was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

A little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

The dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. My kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he “loves his new house”. He asks for daddy nightly saying “I just want daddy be happy. I just want daddy not be mad any more” and it breaks my heart but I just tell him I love him and hold him when he is hurting. I realized even being here I am happier than I ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. I don’t feel like I’m constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

The shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. My 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and I’ve seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

They have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. The attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. They are also filing a long term protective order. 

We have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

I will be starting work again next week. My HR manager contacted the store up where I am now to have me transferred because of the situation. I am so thankful the company I work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though I’ve had to take the last few weeks off while I get things in order. 

The shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on Wednesday for BOTH children while I start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. The daycare facility is wonderful and I’m so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while I start work again! 

Since I am able to start work again too I was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

I was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. I was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

A detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while I handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. The detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. So, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a Class C family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when I was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a Class A and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

He has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying I kidnapped the children and also filed a false CPS report. I handed over all evidence to CPS as well and they immediately closed it saying they “can tell he is not being honest” as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. He DID text me a few days ago saying we didn’t need to get attorneys though and let’s just go file a custody agreement, but I didn’t respond. If I even let him see the children until things get worked out I risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

His mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to Florida so I would never see them again.... 

So, things are moving along. It has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but I’ve never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. I feel like things are pulling together even faster than I imagined. It’s stressful... by the end of the day sometimes I just want to cry still, but it’s not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

I hope one day I can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources ARE available. It’s not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what I ever could have imagined and hoped for and I will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing. "

So this is how things have played out. I decided to speak to my gf about it and she started crying and handed me her messages to read. I pretended I hadn't seen them because she gave me it anyways. We spoke a lot about it and in the end I told her I wont be mad if she decides to press charges. She also asked me to not speak to my father just yet because she wanted to talk to my mother.

We both eventually called my mom and spoke to my mom about it. My mom was really mad and went to speak to my father about it (while we were on call). He admitted to doing it and blamed his alcohol that he did it. (He has been an alcoholic all my life and would often blame his alcoholism on things). 

My mother was obviously furious and kicked him out the house. She told him he is not allowed to come back to the house until he has been to rehab. 

My girlfriend has decided not to press charges, (I've told her numerous times it's okay if she does) for now she wants to stay away from family events that he will be at, and she would like to cut contact with him. She says I dont have to, but I want to rather keep contact with just my mother. Maybe in future if he changes and if he sorts himself out, I'll get into contact. 

Where are we now? My father is in rehab sorting out his addiction as well as seeing psychologists for his behavior. My girlfriend and I are going to counseling separately and together, she is also going for sleep therapy due to reoccurring nightmares of the trauma. (I feel so guilty that this has happened, if I had known my father was this bad I would have never left her alone with him). I am also paying for my mothers counseling. 

I'm trying my best to help my mom and my girlfriend and I'm trying to give them the best possible support I can. I'm still trying to get over the shock and guilt though. Thanks for everyone's support and help. Hopefully this is the right path."

I wanted to thank everyone for your help. This isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

A few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in English that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. But she thanked me and told me she loved me.

The funeral was held in Korea last week, i went with the kids. Her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. They also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

However this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. Even then there is a big language barrier between us. My ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

I still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. I don't really know how to feel about this at all. 

Just wanted to thank you all for the help and support."

Me (27F) and my Husband  (29M) got married about 2 weeks ago.
I have son 3.5yo that adores him and He is like father to Him.

Evrything started about 2h in to our wedding party. 
My Husband got mad at me for ignirong him while I had a short converstion with his best man making jokes.
 
 I ""ignored"" Him only because I didn't hear him speaking to me from behind and I told Him that.
He told me in that moment that- 
/He Has nothing to say to me and he won't be talking to me anymore that Day./

After that I went outside and started cring. I wanted to talk to Him but he refused. 
Pepole came up to me and asked what's wrong and all I could say was that I don't know outside that my husband doesn't want to talk to me on our wedding Day

About 2h later he came up to me mad and told me to stop cring and to go and entertain the guests.
I could not bring myself to do that. I found a place where I could be alone and cried The whole night. 

I came up to him in one moment to ask him to leave with me for an hour so we can talk (we had a room upstairs). He refused saing that he Has responsibility to be with our gests. I asked - what if he loses me over this? Im hurting and I need my husband.  Talk to me.
He responded that if I want to I can leave The wedding ring on The drawer and this way he will know if it's over after The party. 

He came upstairs after 3am. I tried to tuch Him and hug him with made him mad. He told me he came to ned to sleep off, and he doesn't wan't me to disturb nim. I tried to hug him 2 more Times but he phisycly pushed me away. 
After that he go up and wen't downstairs to drink with his friends.

What is important is that there was never anything romantic or sexual between  me and his best man.  
He told me that I disrespected him in that moment by not lisening to him and that is The reason behind his words and actions. 

It's been 2 weeks and it was The worst Day of my Life. 
I tried to talk to Him about it but he dosn't wan't to. He apologised by saing ""I'm sorry, now can we end this conversation?""
Evry time I cried he was agry and said that I don't have a reason to cry. Yeaterday he told me that he doesn't have  feelings of care for me, or need to Comfort me when i cry, or to be with me when I'm hurt because I destroyed it with my constant need to talk about that night and our feelings.
He got up and told me that: he loves me and will protect me from enything bad in life. He huged me while I melted in his arms.  He kissed me on The forehead and looked me in the eyes with warm smile on his face I remember from two weeks ago. I felt safe. 

Then he took a step back and asked. ""Like this? That's what you expected?""  While his face expresion changed in an instant.  My heart broke.
"" How was I?"" 
I cried but in silence. I told Him that it's His decision  and I can stay his wife because of my son and finantial reasons.

I told Him that I love him, and that I will never trust him again and our marrige will be only about kids, work and finances or we get a divorce. 

He tod me that I described what a Good marrige is for him and smiled. 
He wen't to bed right after while I went out on The balcony and cried. 
He was asleep when I came back. 

I known him for 10 years. He is The Love of my Life, I don't know what I did to make nim like that. What can be wrong with me?

Im sorry for The rant and my bad English.  I'm devastated and I don't know what to do."
hqhhan,I walked in on my son haveng sex with my brother's wife,15444,0.99,1574,2020-07-13 21:08:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqhhan/i_walked_in_on_my_son_haveng_sex_with_my_brothers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hqhhan/i_walked_in_on_my_son_haveng_sex_with_my_brothers/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway, on mobile 

I (44F) walked in on my son (18M) having sex with my sister in law (34F)(brothers wife) in a cabin and I think they have been having sex for a while.

My brother(37M) moved in with us  in February with his wife and 2 children, my husband(44M) and I have big house on a farm (my husband is a farmer) and with everyone working from home we thaught it would be a good chance to stay together as family and for my nieces to spend time on the farm. I have 3 children and all of them live with us the oldest is 18M and the other two are 16F and 13F. 

On the day my brother arrived I went to buy groceries with my son and he went to the pharmacy to get his gym supplements and I baught the food. I saw condoms in my sons plastic bag when we arrived at the house two packs with 36 condoms each so 72 in total( didn't think anything of it thaught he had gotten a GF and wanted to be safe). Everything was fine every one got along my SIL and son would go on an early run around the farm everything seemed normal until last month when they left on their run but I was up baking and I never saw them make any rounds around the farm which was weird, I asked about it and they said they decided to hit the road (i thaught nothing of this everything seemed normal). My SIL and son seemed to have a very good bond.

Yesterday I was coming from a friend's house early in the morning the Sun wasn't up yet and it was little dark but I saw that the cabin we have in the farm was open and the light was on (I thaught maybe one of the employees had forgotten to lock up), so I went to close the door and switch off the light as I got closer I heard people having sex and I took a peak and it was my son and SIL having sex, I didn't confront them I was so in shock.

I still haven't told anyone what I saw and I don't know what to do, should I confront them, should I tell my brother, should I tell my husband I'm so confused. I've been doing a lot of thinking and I'm sure they have been having sex for a while from the condoms (my son was always at the house never brought a GF), the morning runs around the farm( do they really go on a run or do they have sex), the close relationship."

Cassie and I were together for 5 years. We started dating in high school and stayed together through college, moved in together after graduation. I’ve been in love with her since before our first date. She’s amazing. I still think so.

We were talking about marriage and starting a family soon. Then one day a few months ago Cassie wanted to “talk,” sat me down, and said she decided she doesn’t want kids. She didn’t just mean not now but not ever. She talked a lot about overpopulation or climate change or whatever but I was just immediately depressed. I’ve always wanted to be a dad. My dad was a piece of shit and this is something I’ve wanted to do ever since I was still a kid myself.

When she finished talking I told her it was over. She started crying and I was already crying, but fuck. If she doesn’t want the same thing I do from the future what else can I do? She said she’s been thinking this way for years and corona was the last straw. I’m not going to wait around and hope she changes her mind when she might not.

So I moved out and moved in with my best friend “Ryan”. We’ve been friends forever, like we bonded over Pokemon cards at the playground kind of thing. He’s basically my brother and his mom was my extra mom since I didn’t have much at home growing up.

I was in a hurry to move out so I didn’t take much stuff with me, and then I didn’t want to go back to the apartment and see Cassie, so Ryan was doing the good friend thing and going to get stuff for me whenever I needed it. At least that’s what I thought he was doing.

Yesterday would have been me and Cassie’s 6th anniversary and it was really rough for me, so I told Ryan I didn’t want to be alone and wanted to hang out and game all day with him. He agreed and everything, but he was kind of distracted on his phone a lot, and after a couple hours he said “something came up” and just left me there alone.

Shit got dark. I’m not ashamed to say I cried. There were reasons I didn’t want to be alone that day.

Almost midnight last night, Ryan finally came home and was acting weird so I asked what was up. I thought maybe his mom was sick or something, she’s a teacher at a school that just reopened.

But no Ryan sits me down and tells me he’s moving out. He’s been secretly dating Cassie since a few weeks after we split. He says they’re in love already and that she needs him more than I do, so he’s moving into the apartment with her and leaving me here alone to rot.

I don’t even know how the fuck to process this. I don’t know which one of them has broken me more. To make things worse I messaged some of our other friends this morning to tell them what’s up and they already knew. When I got upset they all said it was “no big deal” because I’m the one who broke up with Cassie.

Where do I even go from here? I can’t talk to my friends, my ex broke my heart, my best friend stomped on it, and the closest thing I have to family is gone because they were his family too. I’m lost and don’t know where else to turn.

UPDATE: bigger shit to worry about than my broken heart i guess. ryan texted me. i'm about to be homeless in a pandemic

Update2: thanks so much to everyone reaching out. my inbox is blowing up but i'm kinda focused on this housing thing first. i'll catch up when i can. sorry."

I last posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dsj4nn/update\_my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsj4nn/update_my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) about a week ago. She decided to keep the baby, but for a while she'd been complaining about cramps and backaches, which we were told by the doctor will be expected and normal. I think they were a whole lot worse than she let on, but she didn't tell me.

Around 1:30 AM last night, the bleeding started and we went straight to the hospital, where we were told she had miscarried. They said it was a late miscarriage, which happens after 13 weeks but before 20. As soon as she found out, she lost it. She started screaming at me ""are you happy now?"" and just cried and cried. She had a D&E (dilation and evacuation) and the doctors kept her to look her over and understand why it happened. They said it was about a weak cervix in which basically as the baby grows and pushes on the cervix, in some women the pressure causes the cervix to open before the baby is born, which can result in an early labor or a second-trimester miscarriage. According to the doctor, most late miscarriages are because of that, and they don't typically check for it during pregnancies which is why it's usually not diagnosed until after the miscarriage happens.

The doctors told us her body will recover fairly quickly from it, she'll need some bedrest for some time but she'll be fine. Her emotional state is a whole other problem. She wouldn't let me hold her while she cried and she screamed at me for a while after she woke up from the D&E. She kept on saying how it was my fault and I must be delighted this was happening to her. I told her over and over I was so sorry, I loved her, it was no one's fault, but I may as well have been talking to a wall for all she listened. All night long she cried, wouldn't eat, and couldn't sleep.

Today she was a little better and had some lunch, except outside of her room a pregnant woman (not a patient, I think a visitor to the child next door) walked by and she broke down again.

Right now she's in an absolutely horrible emotional state. I'm so worried about her, I'm terrified she'll do something to herself, she'll be wounded beyond repair, and she'll probably hate me forever. I can't even begin to think that this was ""a blessing in disguise"" which is what my sister told me over the phone today. There's no more baby, but there's so little left of her now. How do I help her?

EDIT: I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to reply to any comments before it was locked, it’s been a busy day. I just want everyone to know, thanks for taking the time to reply. Therapy is a must, I’ll take a look into cheaper options, I’m thinking of reducing my hours, which may be kind of counter-productive but she needs me. For those saying she may try to get pregnant again, I don’t think she will because of the incompetent cervix issue, meaning if she does she knows it’ll probably end in miscarriage. We’ll be looking into getting that treated as well.
For those of you saying this post is fake, trust me, I know how it looks, it seems awfully convenient. I don’t know what to tell you, but that it’s not. I had some time while she slept for a short amount of time which is when I posted. Nobody was picking up at that hour and I had to get advice from somewhere, so thanks, Reddit. This will be my last post and I just want to thank everyone who reached out to me."
ewz3oa,I (21F) think my cousin (32M) tried to sexually assault me but I'm not sure.,15377,0.93,915,2020-02-01 07:36:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ewz3oa/i_21f_think_my_cousin_32m_tried_to_sexually/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ewz3oa/i_21f_think_my_cousin_32m_tried_to_sexually/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This happened two days ago. I was visiting my parents who live eight hours away and that happened to be the same time my cousin was also in town for something. He was staying with my parents and I was surprised because I haven't seen him in like ten years. I only saw him maybe two times when I was young. We are not close at all but I didn't really mind that he was there.

My cousin is married with two kids, and he was really polite and kind and I never doubted him for one second. He looked like a really happy guy, but two days ago my parents went out and we were alone in the house at night. We had dinner and talked for a while. After that I went to bed. 

This is where it gets weird. He was reluctant to let me go. We were talking about cooking skills and bickering. He said he wanted to make me a bedtime smoothie to show off his cooking skills. I was full already and I declined the offer. He insisted I wait for him to make it but I said no and went to sleep. After maybe 15 minutes, he came to my room with a smoothie and insisted that I drink it or at least try it. I laughed and said I will and closed the door.

I was sleepy and didn't feel like drinking it so I just poured it down the drain, placed the glass on my bedside table and went to sleep. 

I woke up to him caressing my thigh. He had turned the lights on and he was sitting on my bed. I freaked out and asked him what the fuck he was doing. He looked shocked I was awake and he glanced at the empty glass. I felt THAT GLANCE I saw it CLEARLY and felt it like a punch to my stomach. I immediately knew. I just KNEW. I jumped away from him and he looked embarrassed. He walked out without saying anything. I locked the door and stayed awake the whole night. It was the most terrifying night. 

I don't know why I didn't call the police. I was terrified. My hands were shaking. I couldn't even touch my phone. I had this fear that if I call anyone, he would attack me. 

Anyway, the next day he acted like nothing happened. He told my mom in front of me that he had made a smoothie for me at night and that he also went to my room to check up on me while I was sleeping. ""I tried to give her a massage so she could sleep better but I think I scared her"" was what he said while laughing. My mom also laughed and now I don't know what to do. What was it? What is happening? I feel dirty and I don't know, guilty? I feel strange. I don't know what I should do. I don't have any proof and pretty sure no one would believe me. Please. Any help? I feel unsafe. 

Last night I woke up startled because how the fuck can I sleep? What if someone attacks me? There's nothing I can do if something happens to me while I'm sleeping. I can't sleep. I want this fear to go away. 

tl;dr :- i woke up at night to my cousin sitting on my bed and touching my leg. He had made me a smoothie earlier and had insisted I drink it before going to sleep. I didn't drink it. He looked shocked that I was awake so I feel like he put something in it. The next day he acted like nothing happened. What should I do? He's married with two kids. Should I tell them? I have no proof.

Update: wow you guys are so so supportive. I can't thank you enough. Reading through these replies, I don't know what to say... You all are amazing. I appreciate it so much, you have no idea. I'm just not in a good place at the moment. So many things have happened in this month. 2020 is such a bad fucking year for me....

I'll try to find the courage and talk to my mom about this. I'm terrified that she's not going to believe me but I will try. Some of you asked about the glass, but it's already clean guys. It's been two days. Also I don't know if I should've mentioned this but my bf of two years broke up with me a few days ago and that's why I'm home at the moment. My mom didn't think anything of my cousin checking up on me because everyone knows I'm not well. I've been crying non-stop for the past two weeks so she probably thought it was nice of him to take care of me idk. He has a charming personality. He appears to be very caring and my mom seems to really like him. That's why I'm scared of talking to her but I will. I can do this. I'll give you an update whenever I can."

He said it just looks unappealing and he doesn’t wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. He gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so I didn’t push him to continue until I finished and I said he could stop. He doesn’t like fingering me either. He basically just said that he doesn’t like looking at it or anything. He said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

So I thought I had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. My inner labia are not long or stick out and I’m an innie or whatever. I taste and smell fine. I think he just doesn’t like vaginas. But he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it’s just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. No attention down there. I do cum but I have to touch myself because he won’t do it. It’s just basically like he’s having sex with me and I’m masturbating like rubbing my own clit so I can get off too. I don’t wanna force him to do anything he doesn’t like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? He’s 100% straight and he likes boobs and he’s attracted to girls and he likes when I wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. He just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. His penis is not beautiful I still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. Idk it’s weird. 

My friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. My friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they’re always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. Not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. My friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. My boyfriend doesn’t even like to ever look at my butthole. My boyfriend thinks it’s disgusting if I get too wet and he said it’s like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if I drip onto his sheets and dirty them. He will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that’s it. I get jealous sometimes. I wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. It sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. It’s like he hates me for having a vagina or something. He’s never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. G"

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

 Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blf7xp/update_my_roommates_21f_parents_keep_letting/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TLDR: My family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making        up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ❤

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived here in America for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

Edit 2: I took out the part where RM tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  It was funny though. 

Edit 3: I added a TLDR. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments. 

The cops are yet to show up. 

Edit 4: GUYS WE FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE KEY BACK. FUCKING DAMN ITTTT

Turned out to be new activations, no big deal. Although, while on the main page I noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. Shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. I expect her to have a lot of texts. I got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when I text her at work cause shes busy.....Who could she be texting? I decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

I honestly dont know what to think. My curiosity got to me and I started plowing through old phone bills. This number started showing up on August the 8th. Since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. Often into the wee hours of the morning. Shes never mentioned any new friends... 

So I get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and I start helping her find it. I found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. I HATE being that guy but I did it. Checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. Some dude . She has him programmed first and last name. Checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. Looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and I also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! Said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

I love my wife and I trust her completely, i think. I dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. Or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. And actually now that I think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 I really dont like the direction this is heading. Am I reading to much into this? We've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. We havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. Not for lack of trying on my part. Shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. Anyone have any advice?

Tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since August; shits pointing towards infidelity but I'm trying to rationalize her actions..."
dlx8az,My [26F] girlfriend [24F] thinks she's an Instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!,15224,0.94,1254,2019-10-23 15:49:41,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlx8az/my_26f_girlfriend_24f_thinks_shes_an_instagram/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlx8az/my_26f_girlfriend_24f_thinks_shes_an_instagram/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"When I met my girlfriend 3 years ago, I knew very quickly she was addicted to Instagram. She was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

This didn't really bother me at first - I actually found it kind of hot? Mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - I felt, I guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then I think).

Other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. Every day is punctuated by ""Insta time"" where I'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for Instagram content... It's ridiculous. We've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, I'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. I'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

It was routine stuff, I asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

So the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. She desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. She's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but I didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for IG, she was actually trying to make money from it. I know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

Essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. Before you say it - yes, I'm probably going to break up with her. But the thing is, she's got a really good heart and I genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). Is there anything I can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

Tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an Instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform."
fqrzt9,Isolation has led to my roommate [25/M] and me [23/M] routinely cuddling,15211,0.89,828,2020-03-29 02:06:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fqrzt9/isolation_has_led_to_my_roommate_25m_and_me_23m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fqrzt9/isolation_has_led_to_my_roommate_25m_and_me_23m/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,False,,False,"I’ve been living with my roommate for a year, and we’ve just renewed our lease for another year. He was a friend-of-a-friend and I needed to get out of an abusive situation, so I moved in with him without really knowing him well. He can be a hard man to know, as he’s naturally very quiet and to-the-point, with a cold face. He’s naturally large and athletic as well. I was a bit intimidated and scared of him, I’ll admit, but he’s helped me out getting me back on my feet after my ex. Despite his stoic face, he’s a warm and protective friend.

Our state’s on 24/7 Plague Lockdown, basically only essential businesses open. Both of us are working from home, and the weather has been bad so we can’t even get out for a 6-foot apart walk. We’re the only human contact each other has had for what feels like months.

Last week, we watched a movie together in the living room, and I fell asleep. I woke up with him asleep and me asleep on his chest. This opened the floodgates of him seeking me out to cuddle and sleeping (literally) in my bed. We’ve never talked about it, and he’s the one who initiates. My feelings are all jumbled up, and I feel like I’m taking advantage of him wanting to be around people during this time.

ETA: some of you seem confused. I am openly gay. I have no idea about my roommate, he's never dated for as long as I have known him.

TL;DR: quarantine has deprived me and my roommate of outside human contact, we’ve been cuddling each other. I’ve developed a crush and feel like I’m taking advantage."

The people in question followed me to a small stream leading onto a park I was walking to, then proceeded to grab and grope me, hit me and tell me they were going to rape me, and try to forcibly remove my clothes. Thankfully a couple walked by and saw what was happening, and got me out of the situation. I was taken back to my home and I called the police, then a report was filed.

Two days later my mother forced me to go on a walk with her, and told me I was 'being dramatic'. I had a panic attack halfway through the walk because I was worried that it would happen again,as we were near where it happened. My mother told me that I just needed to 'move on' and 'carry on with life'. I tried to explain that it wasnt that easy, and that I couldnt 'move on' less than two days after it happened. She proceeded to get extremely mad at me, and tell me that I 'wasnt even sexually assaulted'. She didn't believe I was, even though the police told us it was sexual assault becuase they had grabbed and touched me without consent. She still wouldnt listen.

This continued up to the point where she got so mad at me that she wouldnt speak to me. My father tried to calm her down, but he ended up siding with her and agreeing that I should 'move on'. We haven't properly spoken in three days now, and they wont speak to me until I 'move on'.

I don't know what to do, I can't move on as easily as that. I wont get into details about what happened to the boys, but they were taken into police custody. My mother also uses that as an excuse to get me to move on, and she tells me they cant hurt me anymore. I can't just move on, I can't and my mother doesn't understand. She wont let me go to therapy, or talk to anyone that can help me, she just says I need to 'suck it up'. I don't know what to do.

 Can anyone give me advice on how to make her understand I can't move on as quickly as that, and that I need time to heal?

Hello everyone, I said that I'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response I got yesterday. In many ways, I was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but I found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. Thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200B;

I spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. He basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. We had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning I went back to the flat and confronted her. She was there (neither I nor her work on Saturdays), and I set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner I could.

&#x200B;

 Basically, I said that I didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. The wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. She basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". Look, I'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. I basically said that over the weekend I'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (I'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . Towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but I stood my ground and didn't change my course. Not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200B;

I left, and there is nothing much more to say really. As I type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). I'll be grand, being totally frank I feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  The coming days I'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"". "

**\*Edit\* Final Update from the previous thread because a lot of you didnt seem to read the original post or missed its final update here it is so i dont have to keep answering things that have already been answered.**

Well I truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. I didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. I really didn't expect all the support I got. I was flooded with Comments, Pms and chat requests. Some were about what I expected. Accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response I expected. What I didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. You were all right in that I did know what I really wanted. I did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push I needed to not waste anymore time. Shoot your shot right?

I'd like to address a few things before I get into the update

A few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. I was pretty sure he wasn't married I did out-calls to his home and my married clients NEVER take me to their home always a hotel. But I was regularly in his home, I saw the pictures of her around the house I know she was real.

How can I trust a guy who uses escorts? Well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what I do. I cant imagine judging a man for using my service. I was his first too and unless hes a good actor I know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. I never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business.

I should wait for him to approach me. Unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. As the lines became blurred I did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous I had to drop. I am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. I had to be the one to make this move

Do I want to do this forever/Do I really want to give it up? Different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. Some in favor some against. Bottom line is I don't think I see myself doing this into my 30's. It used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets I look forward to anymore are the ones with him. I also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. I heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but I just cant. Even if he would be ok with it I just cant. Another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what I do. Shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

A lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. I imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so I'll put it here. We have been. For some time now. We meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. We also text throughout the week.

Ok on to the Update. I think I left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. This was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. I posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. He said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. Then he followed up with a question about if I would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. And I sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. He had to go back to work by this point and I invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. He has never been to my home. I dont bring clients back there only friends. I hoped that sent a strong signal to him.

I went back home and started getting ready, I had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. I called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as Reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" I told her about the reddit post and said I was making the jump. I also let her know I wanted to take her up on her offer. I called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. I said something had come up and I wouldn't be available. I'm out. I'm done regardless of what happened with him If I cant get my head in the game anymore and I'm getting too personal, plus now I am realizing I want to be in a relationship and I cant separate sex from my feelings like I thought, its time to call it. This isn't what I want anymore. This choice was for me not him. Even if things didn't work out with him I realized I really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. One thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when I told him. I honestly didn't believe he would but I asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. She knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

I got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. He came by at around 7. He had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. I invited him. He said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. I told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. I dont bring clients to my home. I was really hoping he was getting the hint. Dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but I could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. So I put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""Shoot my shot"" as you all put it. I told him I was dropping him as a client. He looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? What did he do wrong? Did something happen. I assured him it want about him. I was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. I told him about the job I took and he wished me good luck, he said I was attractive and charming and he was sure I would do well in sales. He said he was going to miss me. I took a big deep breath and said. ""You dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" And then I spilled it. He was the only client I brought home to tell in person. I laid it all out all the things I mentioned in the post. How I felt about him and how I didnt want to be his escort anymore. I wanted to be his girlfriend. I said I understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now I was asking to stick around and I would understand if he didnt want to continue on. He said who told you that? That he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. He said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. He was still hurt over his wife And that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. He asked me if I was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. I told him I could work with it and that I wasn't trying to replace her. We kissed. I led him into my bedroom and we made love.

We spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. He offered to help me make the transition but I told him I wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. I appreciated his offer and if I needed the help I would ask but I need to do try on my own at first. He respected that. I told him that things would change now. As his GF I would have expectations of him I never had as an escort. He was ok with that. I told him I never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now I wanted monogamy I would give it and I wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and I reminded him I dropped my clients. He said that wasn't a problem. I was the only one. He spent the night with me and left this morning.

Where is this going to lead us next? I have no idea. Maybe I am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was God working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. Fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. I'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. My whole life has drastically changed in just a day. I didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it.

&#x200B;

**Start of New post**

Hey everyone. Well I have been getting a lot of pms and chats about my original post and I decided I'd give you all a Thanksgiving(ish) update and a new question.

&#x200B;

So I know it hasn't been that long since my first post but one of the things some people had brought up was that I was a ""fantasy"" to him and if things ever became 'real"" the fantasy would be over and the ""real"" him would show up. Well I am happy to say no abusive, misogynistic, malignant, nefarious side of him has as yet been revealed to me. He's very much still the same kind and wonderful man I fell in love with.

&#x200B;

Our relationship is changing and very much for the better. There's no longer any fear between us. We can both be honest about how we feel about each other without the other being scared we were crossing lines. Plus now that I am out of the biz My nights and weekends are much freer then they previously were and thats time I am spending with him now that otherwise I would have spent working. It's really nice to be able to see him whenever I want and not have to worry about other client bookings. We were able to get away for the weekend together. I feel like a teenager in love.

&#x200B;

He's always doing sweet little things for me. Love notes, or flowers and chocolates this next part is something that happened while the lines were still blurred between us but its an example of what a thoughtful person he is. We were in the mall together he had to get some fancy clothes for a work function and we were at Neiman Marcus. While we were there I saw a beautiful (and expensive) Carolina Herrera dress I fell in love with. I didn't mention it to him but he must have noticed me ogling the dress and talking about it with the sales lady. Well the next time we met he had a gift for me. That dress! Like I said he noticed. I didnt tell him or ask him for it he just picked up on it and got it for me. I dont need gifts of expensive designer dresses or jewelry from him, but its nice to know I have a partner who really listens and notices things and acts on it. Honestly I would be just as happy if it had been a pair of 15 dollar sweats from target that I really liked. Its really the thought that counts. Take a hint guys your ladies will appreciate it if you notice what they like and act on it without being told. It makes use feel special and like you really care enough to pay attention.

&#x200B;

I've been spending a lot of time at his house. I'm there all the time now and spend the night on a regular basis. So much so that he got me my own toothbrush and products for me to keep in his bathroom. I know its early days yet but we are talking about me moving in with him when my lease expires.

&#x200B;

His family alternates who hosts Thanksgiving every year and this year was his turn. So while the lines were still blurred he had invited me to come by to Thanksgiving with his family and friends. I wasn't sure at the time because I still didn't know where I was going but after we hooked up and made it official it was a no brainer that I would go. We talked about how we would introduce me and how we would say we met if asked. We agreed we would tell people we met on an online dating site. Its not that far from the truth. He first contacted me through an ad I had up on a ""dating"" site. So I made something to bring and then headed to his house early so I could help him in the kitchen. We both enjoy cooking so it was fun to work together in the kitchen. He started introducing me to everyone as his ""girlfriend"" and I dont know hearing that just made it so real and so official. Like this was really happening. I had little hearts floating around me all day. His family was thrilled to see him move on and his brother later pulled me aside and thanked me for making his brother happy again. That he hadn't seen his brother smile like that since his late wife passed and he knew it was because of me. I had to keep the tears from smudging my mascara and eyeliner.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing. I know he hasn't entirely moved on yet. I dont want to push him or rush him. I know he loved her for years and she was taken from him. I know I cant ever fully ""replace"" her and that she will always have a place in his heart. Her clothes are still in his closet. He still has all her stuff. Is it wrong that I want his whole heart though? How much time do I give him? I agreed when this started to be patient with him because he was honest with me about not being over her death but still loved me and wanted to move forward with me. I know he feels guilty at times like he is dishonoring her memory. I think Thanksgiving helped because he saw how his family positively responded to him having someone new in his life. I just want him to heal and be able to be happy with me and not feel like hes cheating on her. Is there anything I can to help him with that? Or is it best if I just leave it alone and let him come to terms with that on his own?

&#x200B;

\*\*edit\*\* Hope all the Americans had a wonderful Thanksgiving yesterday!

\*\*edit 2\*\* here we go again with the pretty woman references. You're not the first to post it so its not new or original or funny. Yes I've seen it. I know its hard for some of you to imagine that sex workers and our clients can be human with human feelings but one thing I learned pretty quickly in my last post is that this story is not nearly as uncommon as I or you thought. I was flooded with pms and chats from former SW's or clients who had similar experiences and \*gasp\* have had happy and successful marriages for 10,15, 20 years. I know some small minds cant comprehend it but just because it is outside the realm of your comprehension doesn't make it impossible.

\*\*edit 3\*\* To everyone with useful advice thank you. I am sensing a theme here of patience, understanding, support, and letting him work through this without pushing it.

\*\*edit 4\*\* once again thank you for the support and kind comments. And thank you for the silvers, golds, and platinum. To the haters, Kiss my brown latina ass, oh wait you need to pay for that and I'm not taking any clients.

\*\*Edit 5\*\* Again thanks for all the love and support. What I have really taken away and what I will put into practice is to be patient, dont view her as competition, give him all the time he needs whether thats one day or forever, to embrace her and her memory as an important part of my bfs life, and that he can still love her and cherish her memory while giving me all he has to give now."

For mothers day all I wanted was a free day, I wanted my husband to take the kids out somewhere for the day so I could be home alone and relax. Instead he got me and the kids tickets to have a fun day out. And it was fun, and me and the kids had a good time but it irked me that he gave me the exact opposite of what I'd asked for.

For father's day my husband also wanted a free day so he could stay home and game all day. He games all the time with his friends, he'll get home from work, maybe spend the time between then and dinner with the kids before going up to his office to game for a few hours with friends.

Instead, I got him and the kids cards for an arcade an hour away with a ton of tokens. I gave him the cards during dinner on Saturday so he and the kids could leave early and spend all day playing with them.

I got my free day and he and the kids got to make a lot of memories together. He and I got into a fight when the kids went to bed, he was angry that I ignored what he wanted for Father's day, I was angry he didn't see that he'd done the same thing to me on mother's day. He's been ignoring me since and won't accept my apologies.

TLDR: I ignored my husband's wish to have a ""Free day"" of fathers day and got him and the kids a day out because he did the same thing to me on mother's day and now he won't stop ignoring me or accept my apologies.

Edit: Some people are thinking that me, my husband and our kids went out for Mother's Day. We didn't, I took the kids for a day out while he played video games all day with his friends.

Edit: I can't believe I have to say this: **I do not hate, resent or in any other way dislike my children.** My point was not that going on a day out with them is terrible and I hate it. My point was that it really sucks asking for on thing and being given the opposite "

**\[A LITTLE UPDATE\] I didn't think my story would get this much reaction, thank you all you guys for caring and giving me advices. I tried to read all the comments that I could. T thought I could get through this alone but you guys make me realized that I am not alone so I just called my little sister and she will be on the train to the city tomorrow morning to stay with me for the weekend. I also called my parents and her parents and they agreed to come to us this weekend to discuss this matter. I don't know how it's gonna go but I hope I can update my situation in the next few days.**

So we grew up together in a small town, known each other for our whole life and eventually fell in love when she was 17 and moved to the city together 2 years ago. I work as a carpenter and she's still at uni. Two weeks ago she suddenly dropped the news that she's 3 weeks pregnant. I know for sure it can not be mine because I always use protection and never have sex under alcohol/drug influence (I don't drink or smoke). So I pressured her and she confessed that she slept with an exchange student during a school vacation trip. She said he's been hitting on her for weeks but the sex was unplanned (that's why he didn't have condom prepared and she didn't have pills ready) and it's only one time thing and she has no feeling for the guy anymore.

I was totally in shocked but after a day, I decided that I can't stay in this relationship anymore: First, I am not ready to raise a child that is not my own. Second, I don't know if I am able to forgive her for betraying me, at least not at the moment. So I break it off, asked my boss if I can stay at the worker rooms (for temporary worker) at the warehouse and let my girlfriend stays at our place till she find a house (I pay full rent because only I work).

So eventually our families and our mutual friends got the news and now they are all pressuring me to get back with my girlfriend (except for my sister who supports me). They say it's wrong to abandon her at a time like this, especially my dad who I had a fight with every two days because of this. He said he knows she's a good girl, just a young people mistake, that I should stay with her and give the child for adoption ... And my friends keep messaging me convincing me to take her back. One of them even accuses me because I am the reason she moved to the city so it's my responsibility.

Now I am heart-broken, lonely and shattered. Feels like the whole world doesn't give a single fuck about how I feel. I just want to move to a new city and start everything from zero but don't have the courage. Maybe some advice from you guys would ease the stress.

TL;DR: My (M24) long-term girlfriend (F22) cheated on me, got pregnant but everyone around me pressuring me to stay with her."

Normally this doesn't bother me at all, I agree with her on most issues. 


Yesterday we got into a fight because she saw an article about police violence and how it was mostly perpetrated by men. She said that men were ""failed abortions"" and we wouldn't have these problems if they were born women. I took offense to that and we ended up in an argument where she said that she clearly didn't mean all men and said I was being oversensitive. I felt like it definitely crossed a line, and it hit particularly hard because I've had some questioning of my gender identity and haven't always wanted to have been born a man (I've been open with her about this and she's usually supportive).


The argument simmered down after a day or so and now she's trying to walk the statement back and be apologetic for it. I'm having a really difficult time getting it out of my head and I'm not sure what to do.


Edit: this is getting a lot of traction and I just want to try to clarify some things. We've had the whole discussion about hyperbole and how people expressing frustration against a group doesn't necessarily mean they hate them. I get that and I'm fine with it, but this was hard to hear and I'm having real trouble separating my feelings from hyperbole. This especially hurts because of the gender identity stuff I've shared before and how unilateral of a statement it was, and she initially acted like I shouldn't have been offended. I just feel really sick about myself and my body and at the very least I think I need time to process things


Edit 2: removed references to feminism because multiple commenters have said that this isn't it, and I agree. I spent some time looking up feminist resources as I consider myself one and I urge others to do the same, because whatever you think it is, it's not about hatred"

This is gonna be a long one. 

Where to begin? Girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. Friends, coworkers, acquaintances. Even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

Fine. I love her. I understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it’s not that big of a deal even though I’ve lost sleep over it. 

Girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. One of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. While I can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. Some of these stories I’ve never heard before. Call it insecurity but I’ve never asked a woman if she’s had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. I asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she’s put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. What?

A few days roll by and she’s continued these talks with this person. We’ve had our arguments and came to an understanding of ‘if he does or says anything that crosses a line’ she will end the friendship. 

But where is the line? He’s already had her describe herself. Explain past relationships. Sex talk and favorite kinks. Taking until hours in the morning. Where is the fucking line?

I told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me I have nothing to worry about. 

Well. 

I just looked at her phone.

And while I wish I didn’t. I’m glad I can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. They’ve been flirting. The questions via text were 10x worse. And her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her S/O. 

But what’s worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that I’m being insecure and allow him to chime in that I’m creating disorder. Then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. And her saying yes. 

Not even 2 full days into 2019 and I’m about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

Username checks out. 

Do I ask for advice now or am I on the right track. I need clarity...

Thank you for making it this far. 

TLDR - Girlfriend who made me end friendships due to her insecurity ends up flirting with a guy she met 3 days ago and accusing me of being insecure about it. Her texts determined that was a lie.  Breaking up with her unless I’m overreacting."

I finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and I wasn't prepared for it.

We were alone and I just asked if she loved me. I called her mom for first time in months. I wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. I just ranted to her without letting her speak. How I needed her attention and it's affecting me. I played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. I asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. I would stay out late just so that she would call me. I flipped and told her she should have never had me. I fucked up.

I made my mom cry that night.

She told me that she did love me. 

She revealed that she was raped by my dad. He was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. She became depressed and carried me full term. She is still recovering from her depression. My grandparents wanted her and I to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. At first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. This is why she has been distant from me. She doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. In the end she just gave up. I remind her of her rapist but she knows that I am gentle and kind. I didn't know what to say, I just hugged her. It was a hard truth to swallow. I told her that I will always be there for her. She told she didn't know I was hurting inside. I told her we can start again from scratch.

My mom joked that I scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. I cried as I went to sleep. I can't blame her anymore and I should make a better effort to be more involved with her. I want to support her. I'm not going to break off contact with her. I going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

I'll try my best to be a good son. Thanks for the advice.

I wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

Edit: Thank you for all the support. I will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

dkpxfk,My daughter is dying of complications from cancer. My wife and I don't agree on final interventions. How do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?,14865,0.97,695,2019-10-21 02:40:04,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkpxfk/my_daughter_is_dying_of_complications_from_cancer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkpxfk/my_daughter_is_dying_of_complications_from_cancer/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. Too much ugly crying.

We have been battling cancer for many months now. Her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. Eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. Either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. She could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. The other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

If she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt CPR. We have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

If she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

Both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. Even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. On top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

I don't want either of these interventions as I feel she has gone through enough. My wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. I don't want her to suffer any more.

I don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. We have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. A part of me feels like a POS for not wanting to try anything but I just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

What do I do to find common ground. I tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. Perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. My wife and I have agreed on a plan. We are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. Please support childhood cancer research. No parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: I appreciate all the advice and I want to give another update. Firstly, my daughter is only 5. I don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. Either way this all happened rather quickly. Last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. She was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. Her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called VOD which came on her very quickly. Within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

She does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. The medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. She has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

My wife and I decided to try intubation again but say no to CPR. She was intubated a couple hours ago. So far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. Both my wife and I are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

Thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. We'll take all the positive energy we can get."

ev66yp,"Boyfriend of 16 years - doesn't pay, forces sex, I'm at a loss on what to do",14834,0.85,3373,2020-01-28 19:51:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ev66yp/boyfriend_of_16_years_doesnt_pay_forces_sex_im_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ev66yp/boyfriend_of_16_years_doesnt_pay_forces_sex_im_at/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Well, this was longer than I expected and probably disorganized. 

I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) since highschool. It's been around 16 years. We were long distance at first for quite a few years and then moved in together. 

Since living together just us, he started by not paying any rent because he didn't have a job. This was fine, he can't pay what he doesn't have. But when he would stay home he wouldn't help with anything. No dishes were done, laundry, garbage taken out, dog walked. Nothing. I was pretty vocal about how I needed help but would only get assistance if I asked for it (coming home from work and asking can you do the dishes kind of thing) 

Eventually he got a job (after about a year) and started to contribute half which was such a relief. 

I got a really good job and we decided to move out of the shitty place we were in. We moved to a condo and it was wonderful except all of a sudden I was paying everything again. It started with him not sending me his half of the rent to send to the landlord. Then all the bills were under my account because I was the only one who thought to set them up. Then I would ask for his part of the rent and he would say he couldn't afford it. I offered for him to pay less then half and he would send it every once in a while (maybe 4 times in a year). 

While this is going on, he's still not contributing. I would come home to the dog crying to go out, the house a mess and him playing video games. Not only that, he would hog the ps4 so I couldn't play as well.

I ended up getting a maid service to help me. I was that desperate for help. 

Anytime I would be at my last straw with him, he would all of a sudden clean up. He would go a month without helping and I would call my mom being like ""that's it I'm done"" and suddenly he would make supper, clean, offer to play ps4 with me. Total shift so I would stay and think maybe he's getting better. 

We now both have really good jobs and he's paying rent more consistently but I'm still paying the most due to bills and paying the most in rent. I'm trying to save up for a house and hes.... Buying electronics. 

The icing on the shit cake here is that we don't have sex. I am far too tired from working and cleaning and honestly... I don't want to have sex with him. He doesn't help me. Why the fuck should I pay for everything, clean AND fuck him? 

The issue is though he tries to have sex with me in my sleep. He did this years ago and recently started it again. He grabs my hand, puts it on him and thinks playing with my boobs will make my hand move? I have no idea but it's freaking annoying. It wakes me up and then I can't get back to sleep. 

A few years ago when he did this I started sleeping on the floor in the living room. For about 3 years I slept on the floor instead so I wouldn't be bothered. 

I don't know what to do here. He talks about how I don't want to have sex with him and I told him he doesn't contribute enough or even do anything loving for me at all. Then, of course, I'll see dinner made and dishes done but... I'm still tired. 

It's been 16 years of my life.... Was this a waste? What do I do? I've offered to see a couples therapist but he doesn't seem keen on it. I just want to be happy again and I can't remember  the last time I was. 

TL;DR boyfriend of 16 years doesn't pay much rent, if at all, and doesn't help with tidying up. He tries to have sex with me in my sleep which is messing up my sleep and my ability to work. We don't have sex because of all this.

Edit: I know the answer is probably to leave him but I wanted to mention I feel bad thinking about that. He doesn't know how to do things on his own. I don't know what would happen to him and it's unpleasant to think about. I do care about him. I just want to be in a partnership and not be used I guess.

Edit 2: I'm sorry I haven't responded to anyone I'm a little overwhelmed by the response. Thank you for all the kind messages. I'm looking into a therapist currently and need to sit down with my bf and have a conversation. If anyone has advice on how to do that, I'm grateful.

I also wanted to say, he does do some things that are good (to those who commented about how negative I was). I can't drive (VI) so he does take me places when I need it. I'm in the hospital quite often and he never complains about driving me places. He's also really funny and we know each other so well. I just don't know if I can deal with the negatives anymore. I'm tired."
fef04y,ThrowRA: I (32F) was offered a promotion. He (31M) refuses to move.,14704,0.9,3539,2020-03-06 20:56:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fef04y/throwra_i_32f_was_offered_a_promotion_he_31m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fef04y/throwra_i_32f_was_offered_a_promotion_he_31m/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,,False,"[FINAL UPDATE!](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAMoneyOrHim/comments/is4y3j/final_update_throwra_i_32f_was_offered_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

We've been married for almost a decade and have two children that are elementary school age.

I work remotely. My job offered to *literally* double my income if I move to be local to where the company is.

To me, this is a no brainer. That's a life changing offer for us and our kids.

However, he refuses to move. His family is here and he won't leave them.

He claims money isn't everything, which is true... But it sure helps and with the promotion I've been offered, **he could travel to see them as much as he wanted to**. He wouldn't even have to work if he didn't want to.

He says he's happy here and he wants the kids to grow up around family. I get that. I do. However, if he wants the kids to grow up around family, we're living in the wrong state anyways because I have 100x the amount of family in a different state than he has here. What he means is he wants the kids to grow up around *his family.*

I am interpreting this as him choosing his family over me and that crushes me. WE (The kids and I) are his family and he should want to do whatever he can to give US the best possible life. Never in my life did I think I'd have to fight for the priority spot in his life over his mom.

I don't know what to do. I want this promotion. I will never see this kind of money otherwise. At the same time, I am not one to thump my chest to get my way. We always make decisions together, but we're at a crossroads with this and I don't know how to reach a mutual agreement. No matter which route we take, someone loses.

What would Reddit do? Take the promotion with or without him? Or decline the promotion and stay here where his family is?

Edit: This got a ton of traction that I wasn't expecting so let me clarify some things.

Where my job is, we've lived there before. We lived where we are currently for 6 years, where my job is for 4, then we moved back a year ago.

My daughter wants to move back. My son doesn't.

We are ""one emergency expense"" away from being homeless type of middle class. We have no savings, we can't vacation, my parents pay for school supplies and clothes.

My biggest issue is that his sole reason for not wanting to move (At least what he tells me) is that he wants to stay close to his mom.

I am not looking for a divorce. I take my marriage very seriously. I feel I've sacrificed a shit ton to ensure this marriage stays successful. Divorce is not something I entertain. That's why, when push comes to shove, I know I'll be the one to give up my opportunity. For the sake of keeping my family together. That's how it's always gone. I know that that's where this is headed.

I was hoping for advice on how to navigate this and maybe some further understanding as to why he doesn't want to move, since he won't tell me anything else.

Also, I am trying to respond to everyone but this is blowing up way faster than I can keep up with, so be patient with me. LOL

Edit 2: I've been reading comments for 3 hours straight. For every comment I read, 3 more come in. I am trying, I swear! I promise I will read every single one of these. LOL 

One more clarification, MIL won't move because her boyfriend won't so that's off the table."

I had Lucy, my daughter when I was 16 and I met Adam when she was 2.

Lucy’s biological father was never involved and Adam stepped up and took on that role for her and then we had Jessica and he’s just a great dad, the girls adore him.

Around 4months ago he told me he’d had an affair with someone we barely know, well clearly only I barely know her.

Things ended and we’re going to relationship counselling.

Now this woman, Naomi, I barely know her so my children had no reason to know of her- she’s like my brothers wife’s sisters friend so I’ve got no reason to introduce them.

Well as we walked past her, because I’m not a confrontational person and clearly neither is she, I decided to ignore her until my youngest decided to ignore me and run up to her and hug her.

I ended up having to drag my youngest away whilst trying to ignore Naomi.

When I asked the girls in the car my youngest said “daddy told us not to tell you” and later on “daddy said it was our secret” 

My eldest is the only one to tell me what happened apparently they’ve had family day outs with picnics (our youngest favourite thing to do) and even visited a small theme park type thing together.

This hurts more than the affair and I don’t know why.

I can move on from the affair but I’m not sure I can move past him playing family with our children and his affair partner.

I’m not sure what to say/if I should confront him or accept this was a part of the affair and that we’re in counselling."

Your advice has been greatly helpful and I would like to thank everyone again for your kindness. 
  
For background context, we are both fully Chinese. I immigrated to the United States by myself when I was 26. I had to learn English on my own and after living for so many years in the United States, I think my reading, listening, and writing skills have become good. However, I have a heavy Chinese accent when I speak and I am still mixing up words that I normally wouldn't when I am writing. I also grew up poor when I was a child, having grown up in a village that still doesn't have plumbing to this day. Due to this, I have a habit of saving takeout containers, using food past its expiration date so long as it still looks good, amongst other things.

&#x200B;

My daughter has always been a bit self-conscious and I think she's embarrassed by me. Whenever we go out to eat, she always asks me what I will order and then order for me or she'll begin to speak for me whenever I have trouble with words. I don't think my English is horrible to the point where I need someone to speak for me and I have told me that I dislike it when she does that but she feels that it is easier if she is the one speaking. I will sometimes shop at the local thrift store for clothes or yarn, but my daughter never wants to come with me and disapproves of me going as well. We are not in need of money, but I don't feel the need to spend more money than I have to on myself and the items I find are perfectly fine. However, I don't mind spending more money on my daughter and I will buy her the clothes and makeup that she wants even if they are expensive. There are times where her tennis team has asked for parents to bring food for cookouts and she gets upset whenever I suggest bringing something like homemade scallion pancakes or spring rolls because they're not traditional cookout foods.

&#x200B;

I think she's also conscious of stereotypes about Chinese people. She always insists on tipping at least 20% even if the service wasn't good. When she was younger, we went on vacation and decided to eat out. Out of the two restaurants we went to that night, none of them served us. We were sat down and forgotten about and she kept coming up with excuses that it was because Chinese people don't tip well so restaurants aren't as friendly and so it's not their fault because they've most likely had bad experiences with Chinese people. When we go on trips, she'll always read this rules and then make sure that I understand as well. For example, when the rule is to stay on the path, she will constantly be looking over at me to make sure I'm not moving too close to the edge. If she thinks I am, she will pull me back to the middle of the path and I'm uncomfortable because I also try to be conscious of my behavior because I know the reputation Chinese tourists have. I feel that she doesn't trust me because I am Chinese. 

&#x200B;

With the Coronavirus pandemic, her mood has gotten worse. I heard from other parents that some of her classmates insisted on calling it the ""Chinese virus."" Ever since the pandemic broke out, she's been really down and I've been trying my best to support her, but she just ends up upset at me to the point where I'm not sure what to do. There have been times where I hear her crying in her room, but she's never willing to tell me about anything. I'm wondering what I can do to support her and make her feel better. I also want her to respect me more as a person and not be so ashamed of me because it really does hurt but I'm not sure how to talk to her about it because she always brushes me off."
ikfcj7,Update - My ex tried to cut my implant out while I was asleep,14644,0.95,533,2020-09-01 12:06:13,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikfcj7/update_my_ex_tried_to_cut_my_implant_out_while_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikfcj7/update_my_ex_tried_to_cut_my_implant_out_while_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,,False,"Essentially, my (now ex) fiancé did a complete 180 personality wise. Was so sweet and loving to both me and my son, until we fought about having another baby last night. He said horrible things and I was tired of fighting, so I took my Trazodone and went to bed. Woke up to him touching my arm implant birth control with a box cutter in his hand. Said he was doing me a favor, but I screamed at him to leave.

I ended up leaving last night with my son to stay at my mom’s. I was confused, shocked, hurt, scared. I still am... At seven this morning, my phone started buzzing like crazy - texts, calls, voicemails. All were from him, asking me where I went and when I was coming home. I didn’t respond. I just don’t even want to look at him or talk to him again. 

He called my mom while we were both sitting in the kitchen discussing everything. She asked me if I wanted her to answer it. I said I just didn’t want to talk to him. My mom ended up answering and my ex was yelling, sounding panicky. He said I left with my son last night out of the blue and he’s worried, no mention of our fight. He asked when my mom last heard from me and she lied and said last night. He made a noise over the phone, like an angry sigh and said he was going to keep searching for me, that he’s worried something bad has or will happen to me and my son.

When my mom hung up, she pulled me into a hug. I guess I had started crying and didn’t realize it. She was still hugging me when she asked how I wanted to proceed, if I was done with him for good. I said I was and she nodded and told me first thing was to go to the police (like a lot of you said). I didn’t have any proof about the box cutter situation - it would come down to my word versus his. If he had even knicked me a little, I’d have a case against him, but since he technically didn’t hurt me, the detective said he’s seen cases similar to mine thrown out. The officer did bring up ex partes and suggested I get one for both me and my son immediately. 

I went to the courthouse to get the paperwork filled out. I had to detail as much as I could remember from last night - every word and action. My mom helped me and we got them turned in and moved on to the next step - calling my landlord. I’ve been living in the same house for two years - the first year was a lease and now I pay month to month. Everything is in my name and most of the furniture is mine. I told my landlord what was briefly going on and that I was putting in my thirty day notice (my mom has a guest room that she’s insisting I stay in). After getting off the phone with him, I called the utilities and closed my accounts - water, electric, gas, internet.

Next my mother asked me what I wanted to do about my belongings. I told her I don’t want to leave anything that’s mine — all important papers, knickknacks, clothes, furniture, all of it. I just didn’t know where to put it, so my mom suggested a storage unit. Once that was decided, we had to figure out when to start the move. Mom ended up calling my two brothers and they both agreed to help me move, just give them a date and time. I told them definitely sometime this week and my eldest brother suggested a police presence, just in case. Think it’s called a civil standby? Idk, but I agreed.

By this point, it’s getting late in the day and I’m as drained as I can get. I just wanted to go curl up with my son and try to sort my thoughts out and calm down. The county clerk ended up calling me, telling me the judge granted my ex partes. She told me that I needed to come pick up paperwork, which had the court date on it. She also mentioned ex-fiance would soon be served and told me I don’t have to see him again until we go to court, to make the ex partes into permanent restraining orders. She suggested lawyering up, but I’m officially burnt out on today. I’ll look into lawyers tomorrow, but tonight, after this update? It’s a cuddle in bed with my son night.

A couple things that I’ve seen repeated - why didn’t I leave right when ex started saying those awful things about my son. I honestly thought he didn’t mean them. He’s told my son he loves him before. Part of it was also shock, I guess. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing and that I was hearing it from someone who I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I didn’t think he truly had hatred in his heart and it never crossed my mind that he would hurt me or my son. He’s never even spanked my son. I just thought we needed a cooling off period, so I removed myself from the situation to take my meds and sleep, naively thinking things would be better in the morning.

People also questioned why I would even bother sticking around to try to talk things out and that’s a valid question that I don’t have a rational answer to. Part of me thought I was dreaming, I think, and the other part is the side of me that thinks everything equates to being my fault, like I was too mean during the fight, too stubborn to see things his way and try to understand his feelings.

Idk. It’s late. Everything feels surreal and I have this pit in my stomach that feels like dread. What if ex shows up at my mom’s house? I still haven’t returned his messages or phone calls and now he legally can’t contact me anyways. I’ve had two of my best friends call, saying ex called them. My younger brother (who I guess has always hated ex but I didn’t know that until today) said even he got a call. So far everyone is saying they don’t know anything, but I’m scared. Idk. I’m sorry. Just thought I’d update.




[UPDATE EDIT] Update to the update - so many people offered great advice that I’d never think of myself. I’ve been kind of heavily relying on my mom to guide me through this and keep me and my son afloat. I’ve also been given several things to read, which I am absolutely going to when I have some down time.  I appreciate every comment, from extremely helpful to well wishes and even the ones questioning the validity of this. To be honest and it’s a horrible cliche, but if it wasn’t happening to me, I probably wouldn’t jump to believing either. Sometimes I let my emotions get the best of me and I end up sounding either very clinical in my typing, or very unnecessarily dramatic. So I get the mistrust. My update last night was written late, I was exhausted, but I wanted to let the people from my original post know — I took their advice and got out of there. My emotions have been so conflicting and chaotic, I’m surprised I was able to sound coherent, let alone like a “teenager writing fanfic”. I wish this was a fanfic. I could feel safe again. 

My mom has been an absolute angel and I’ve shown her some of your comments, complimenting her. And she definitely deserves it! Never once did she make me feel I couldn’t be completely honest with her, she’s reopened her house to me (even though I moved out years ago). She’s really kept the ball rolling on everything with her organization skills. She made a list and yesterday we followed that list to the letter. When I wanted to put stuff off, she’d gently remind me of what could happen if I paused. Ex could find me, hurt me, hurt my son, or anyone helping to protect me.

You all are very right and I’m ashamed to say I didn’t realize just how much support I have and what a tremendous family I have. A couple people mentioned to be careful if Ex finds out where I am — and my mom and brothers already had a plan for me. They called it Round Robining - if Ex found me at mom’s, I’d flee to Eldest brother. If he finds me at Eldest brother, I’d temporarily stay with my younger brother. Really, I appreciate you all commenting that I’m doing things right and quick and how impressive it is, but that’s not my doing at all. That’s all on my family. They’re the extraordinary ones (there goes my fanfic cliches again) going above and beyond for me and my son.

Some of the comments that questioned my validity remarked that it was odd that I immediately went to Reddit to see what to do/how to feel. You’re all right, that it unusual, but not for me. I grew up when LiveJournal was a big thing, writing helps me organize my thoughts and I figured this community would help me understand... and I was right! 

Another thing I want to address is Ex’s sudden change. I’m now wondering what to do for that. I don’t want him in my life still. But some of you mentioned a brain tumor or a psychotic break, so I’m worried. I sent Ex’s mother and father a message this morning saying I broke off the engagement and left, but both messages are still unread. I don’t know what to say to them, in regards to Ex’s health. Will they be mad for daring to say this might be a breakdown? Will they actually take him to get tests ran? And if they even tried, would he willingly go? I don’t know. I guess I need a little more advice about how to broach that.

There’s more to address and I even had a consultation with a lawyer today, but I can go into that another time. I’m still processing everything. It still doesn’t feel real, it feels like a badly written teenage fanfic, to be honest. 

Idk. Sorry for rambling again, guys. I just wanted to let you know I’m taking notes from your helpful suggestions, that I’m not ignoring you guys. My mother took my son for ice cream and let me stay behind, which is why I decided to hop on Reddit and check on everything.

One last thing, though. The AWARDS, I’m truly humbled and grateful for them. Some of them I had to click on to see what it meant and they’re all so sweet! I’m endlessly thankful for the awards, your comments, and your messages.

Thank you!

[UPDATE] When my ex was served his papers, he did not take it well. I had already blocked him on everything, but he took a picture of his paper and posted it on Facebook, with a message to me and my son. A mutually friend saw it (and that it contained my personal information) and screenshot it to let me know. After taking advice, I called the police to see if it was a break in the ex parte. 

They made an incident report and told me I could pick it up the next day at the police station. They didn’t arrest him. My mother had already procured me a great lawyer, “A shark, which is what we need” - in her own words. I told my lawyer about the screenshot and he immediately put in, both his appearance on my behalf, and a motion for contempt of court, for breaking the ex parte and threatening me and my son.

Our original official court date isn’t until next week, but the Judge got us in early to deal with the screenshot. Ex showed up without a lawyer and I showed up with only my lawyer. Due to COVID, no extra people allowed in the court room. I really wanted my mom there with me, but my lawyer (instead of sitting on the bench at the sides, reserved for lawyers) sat by me, kept himself between me and my ex at all times. A bailiff was there as well, I guess it’s standard procedure to have one in court.   

My lawyer advised me to let him do all the talking, only answer questions when directed at me and answer them as succinctly as possible. Judge ended up giving Ex a warning, saying if he even mentions me or my son, he’d put him in jail 24 hours for every incident until the official court date. Ex was also ordered to pay my legal fees for the emergency session. 

Friday, we got mine and my son’s possessions out of the house with massive help from friends and family. I knew Ex had to work Friday and we arrived (with a police officer, just in case) an hour after Ex should’ve been at work. We left anything that he could claim as his or that we’d bought together and I didn’t care about. Most of the items went into two different storage units, from the same place. The reason we chose these storage units is they’re gated and locked at night. The items me or my son would need for everyday use went to my mom’s. 

Ex’s parents HAVE opened my messages now, but they still haven’t responded.

Lawyer said we’re still on for official court date next week and nobody has entered their appearance yet on behalf of Ex, so we’re unsure if he has a lawyer or not. Lawyer told me it’d follow basically the same as the first hearing. It’d be a general hearing, with other people having filed their own ex partes for other people. No extras allowed in the room, face masks required. He’d keep ex away from me. No talking unless answering questions, give succinct answers unless asked to clarify. He’s confident that the ex partes will become permanent restraining orders, but he warned me its not like it is in movies. The restraining orders will go for one year, unless a box is marked saying to re-issue it every year (I marked the box). He also said for every year, Ex has the ability to appeal it and we’d have to go to court all over again. 

For now, I’m just... trying to keep my head above water. I’m kinda afraid because I’ve had people message me to tell me they’ve seen my post on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Some of you sleuths have even found the state I live in. I’m just hoping Ex doesn’t find any of the posts and puts two and two together. 

I’m sorry I haven’t responded to every comment or message and that this update is late. I’ve just been trying to keep my son’s life as normal as possible. It breaks my heart when he asks when we’re going home or where “Papa” is. He just knows we’re having a long sleepover with his Mimi. He’s loving having pets around, though. We weren’t allowed to have animals at my house, so the fact that my mom has a dog and a couple cats, he’s excited. I’ve warned his daycare about Ex. Most of my family and friends are aware there’s a serious situation, but not details. 

Idk. It’s been a long week. I’m exhausted. I keep looking over my shoulder and I’ve made my mom buy extra locks for the doors. Some have mentioned cameras for the outside and my mom has already started pricing some. She said her sister (my aunt) has been trying to get her to try RING for months, so this is the kick in the pants she needed. 

I’m sorry the update is late. Still feels surreal, but I have to just keep swimming (my son is obsessed with Finding Nemo)."
calfeu,[Update] I [25M] got ghosted by my girlfriend [23F] of 2 years.,14548,0.96,1000,2019-07-08 19:33:32,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/calfeu/update_i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/calfeu/update_i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvawkw/i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn’t know she’d be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn’t spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn’t gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn’t want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she’s an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that’s fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn’t even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn’t exist was the best way to do it. 

I can’t say hearing all this helps. I don’t really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

Thanks for all your help guys. Wish it was more interesting than it really was."
b5mysn,"My (18M) girlfriend (F17), is threatening to kill herself every time I express discomfort, and today when I got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself",14532,0.95,2061,2019-03-26 13:31:55,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5mysn/my_18m_girlfriend_f17_is_threatening_to_kill/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b5mysn/my_18m_girlfriend_f17_is_threatening_to_kill/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,,False,"I feel extremely trapped at this point. She was such a great person when I met her and I thought we would be great together.

Unfortunately, for the past month, she’s started to insult me for everything. For example, I could not hear a line of what she said over FaceTime because of internet issues and she flipped saying I don’t pay attention to her. Proceeded to call me names or whatnot. Usually, I just took and it moved on. However, today I just snapped and told her to leave me alone. So I proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and I check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

I just ignore it because I really did not feel like it.  Then she tells me she’s bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. I honestly think I’m traumatized from those videos, I can’t seem to get them out of my head and I feel responsible for them. I texted her father, however it was late so he’s asleep. Thankfully she’s still alive and I’ve managed to calm her down by apologizing, but I don’t feel right. 

I feel trapped, and very fucking sad. I feel as if I’m a monster and I’m causing her to do these things to herself. I never say anything badly to her, I just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. I apologize for my rant but I don’t know. My emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

I hope I can get some advice. For some insight, I don’t ever insult her, not even jokingly. She gets annoyed that I don’t give her attention, but I text her and hang out with her as much as I can possibly give, I am human and a student with responsibilities, I can’t spend 24 hours with her.  

That’s really all. 

Update: 
Just a slight update. I have been in contact with her father and I am being updated on what’s happening. They are seeking professional help for her and I feel that is the right choice for her. I am very exhausted and haven’t really slept, so I’ll try and give updates as I can. Fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. In my case, I’ve decided it’s going to do me harm if I continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

My mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and I’d much rather regain my positive nature. I am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. I’ve read every story and the decision I made has been influenced by your own experiences. I will try and reply to all the messages, but I apologize if I miss anything. I’ll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. I have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and I hope she comes to see what I chose to do a few years from now.

Thank you!
If my spelling or grammar sucks, I’m pretty exhausted, I apologize.

bty3oi,My wife tried to hide my daughter from me.

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in. 

Am I wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? I honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. I'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this."

f0eycc,I felt forced into a threesome by my gf and a male friend,14405,0.88,917,2020-02-08 00:23:07,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f0eycc/i_felt_forced_into_a_threesome_by_my_gf_and_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f0eycc/i_felt_forced_into_a_threesome_by_my_gf_and_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,True,,False,"Throwaway since all parties involved use reddit. My gf (25f) and I (29m) have been together about 5 years. We were drinking (heavily) with a male friend of mine (27m) one night when he brought up the topic of having a threesome. This had not been the first time he suggested this, and we had turned him down on at least two other occasions. My gf and I had discussed this amongst ourselves before after he initially brought it up and had soundly decided against it. I had initially tried to change subjects, but he was pretty insistent, and my gf chimed in, saying ""hear him out"".

I was a little shocked at her response, and didn't know how to react. He kept pushing it, and she seemed interested. I tried protesting this, which was either not heard or ignored. I then tried suggesting we wait for our male friend's gf to come over before starting anything, which I thought was agreed to. But the next thing I know, my gf is asking if we're doing this. All I could really say at this point was ""whatever you want dear"". She proceeds to undress the two of us. At this point I'm catatonic, and couldn't say anything, and couldn't really move much. She then started to try to jam my flaccid wang into herself, and ended up cutting me in a rather sensitive place with her nails. I pushed off of me and went to the bathroom to clean the blood off myself. 

I stayed in the bathroom a minute or two and worked up the courage to stop things, but when I got back, they were fucking. I panicked again and didn't know what to do, so I suggested we move things to the bedroom. I end up collapsing on our bed, and not moving. They end up fucking over me, and I eventually snap out of it and ask him to leave. He packs up and leaves our place. She then asks why I didn't participate more, and we end up fighting then passing out from the alcohol.

The next morning, we tried to patch things up and continue on like nothing happened. However, I noticed text notifications between my gf and him on her phone. I didn't see what the texts were about, but she did admit she was texting him, and that they'd been texting pretty regularly. At this point, I told her I'm no longer comfortable with them talking, and that I don't want him around us whatsoever. She gets angry, says I'm just being immature, that I agreed to the threesome, we were all just drunk, that I better not ruin their friendship, and I just changed my mind in the middle of things. She's also demanding that we have an open relationship, and I'm not comfortable with that. At this point I don't know what to do. 

I feel anxious and pretty confused about what happened that night. I should have been more forceful in saying no. I love her, and we had been talking about getting married. But I'm not so sure anymore. Anytime I try to bring up what happened, she gets angry and shuts down any discussion about it. She says any issues I have with that night are my fault, and that she did nothing wrong. How do I move past something like this? Are we even compatible at this point? Should we just end things?"

She's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. But every time we visit her family I start doubting everything. 

They are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. I come from a very middle class background. I have a good education and a decent career that I really enjoy, but I'm definitely not rich. Because of this, they view me as a loser.

For example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish Honda. When we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. She was furious we didn't bring GF's Land Rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. GF doesn't like to drive on long trips and I'm not allowed to drive the Land Rover (per her parents) so we brought my Honda. 

GF's dad has never spoken to me directly. Even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""What does he do?"" So we went in the house and I gave her dad the usual, ""Hi, merry Christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

One more example: Last year I made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. It was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and I even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. GF's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to GF they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

We managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which I'd normally consider a win. But today I keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if I'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. GF and I have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but I know they'll never accept me. If we get married I'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. GF has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but I can tell it bothers her too. They bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and I think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

So, not to sounds like an asshole, but am I wasting my time? Is this relationship doomed? GF always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but I'm not sure that's true. She always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. But I know I'll never be good enough for them, even if I'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: My girlfriend's rich parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't."
fftnp5,(Update): I(F24) went on a girls trip and ended up heavily making out with one of my friends (F23). Now I can't stop thinking about it and don't know what she thought of it.,14362,0.9,447,2020-03-09 17:37:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fftnp5/update_if24_went_on_a_girls_trip_and_ended_up/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fftnp5/update_if24_went_on_a_girls_trip_and_ended_up/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"**Summary of previous post:** [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fddqag/if24_went_on_a_girls_trip_and_ended_up_heavily/) I went on a birthday trip with some friends. One friend (F23) and I kissed a few times (first was a joke), and it sparked my interest to try it again.

**Update:**

I messaged A after my previous post just saying how I was ready for the weekend. She messaged me back saying she missed me and I asked what she was doing this weekend. She told me she'd let me know what her day looked like and was being *semi* flirty, but I wasn't sure where we were at so I was on guard a bit. We messaged here and there all day, and she had a work event that night. She had a few drinks and said ""I wish I could meet up with you tonight"". I told her she could, but I didn't want a repeat of the trip and said I looked forward to seeing her Saturday though. (I think this may have given her the wrong impression and I will get back to that). The same thing happened Friday where we were both being a bit flirty. I sent her a picture with this flirty filter that said ""how many people have crushes on you: 0"" and she said ""I know at least one person that does"". So that gave me more confidence to not be so shy with her.

Then came Saturday! We went to brunch and it was great. We talked about the trip overall, but we never talked about what happened. Which, since it was in public I'm happy about because we had people way too close to get into all of that. But we just talked and it felt natural, even though I was incredibly nervous, and she kept making comments about how alike we are.

At the end we hugged goodbye and I could tell we both *wanted* to kiss, but neither of us initiated it. I was going to bring it up after I had driven home, but within two minutes of me sitting in my car and leaving, she messaged me saying she wanted really wished she had kissed me, but wasn't sure if I wanted to. I told her I did want to! We had a party that night but she wasn't sure if she was going to come, so I told her if she did, I promised to initiate it this time. Unfortunately she couldn't come, but we're going to meet for lunch this week. The rest of the weekend was a mix of flirty and just talking and it was really nice :)

I'm going to make sure we lay out what we're going for here before anything happens, but I'm very happy with where it is at now!

Thank you to everyone who gave this confused Redditor some great advice! This was completely out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I took that leap and messaged her first :)"
guqonf,UPDATE: my bfs mom found my HIV medication and now his whole family knows my status,14335,0.92,963,2020-06-02 00:34:44,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/guqonf/update_my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/guqonf/update_my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/go0ocs/my_bfs_mom_found_my_hiv_medication_and_now_his/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Hi guys,
So I have my update here, and after mine, my boyfriend wanted to include a response from his POV. 
 
First of all, I want to say thank you so much for all of the support and well-thought out responses. The last couple of weeks were incredibly difficult and your words of encouragement helped me a lot. There was also a lot of great advice and I wish I could respond to everybody.

As for an update, my boyfriend spoke to his family first. One of the things they talked about was how I got HIV. I wanted them to know not because I vengefully wanted them to feel guilty, but because I don’t think I could let go of the resentment towards them if they didn’t understand how deeply this situation has hurt me, and that would require them to know about the trauma surrounding my status. He stood up for me and my boundaries, and explained my pain the best he could so that I didn’t have to do it and get overwhelmed.

A few days later, I spoke to my boyfriend’s sister. She apologized for telling their other sister and husband about my status. She of course was worried about my boyfriend and didn’t know what to do. I do wish she came directly to my boyfriend about it and that would have been the right thing to do, but I appreciate her apology. She let me know that I’m still welcome around her and her husband and that they won’t think of me any differently. That was a huge relief because I care a lot about his family and I was worried about being shunned. She also promised that nobody else would find out about my status from them. I assured her that I take my medication every day at the same time, get tested regularly, and do everything I’m supposed to do to stay healthy and undetectable and that her brother would be okay.

His mom is a different story, however. For a while, his mom wasn’t eating or sleeping or listening to any science about what it means to be undetectable. I haven’t spoken to her yet and have been encouraged by my boyfriend and his sister to not bother because as of right now, she has made up her mind about me as a threat. I’m pretty sure she’s convinced I’m going to kill her son one day. My boyfriend says that now, she seems to be doing better but I still haven’t been able to talk to her or go to her house and so I just feel stuck in this problem and that hurts.
His sister offered good advice, which was that any energy I would have put into trying to prove myself to her should be put into myself and loving myself. I’m still going to try, because I don’t want this burden to lie solely on my boyfriend’s shoulders, but I won’t exhaust myself to do so. She also said to not expect an apology from her because the reality is that it’s not going to happen and I need to cope with that sooner than later.

His mom did say she might change her mind if she heard from multiple doctors that I’m not a risk to him. I’ve gathered contacts from local HIV specialists, HIV education program directors, and infectious disease professors at a local university and will reach out to them when she’s ready.

My concern now is how my relationship with his mom will affect my relationship with my bf in the future. If she always views me as a threat and continues to worry herself sick, I’m worried that one day my boyfriend will feel like he needs to sacrifice the relationship for her health. Her behavior not only affects herself, but the family as well. But we’ll see how things go and if they get better as time goes on.

Another thing is, I know my boyfriend has tried his best to support me during this, but he’s not a very affectionate person and I don’t think he understands that I’m still struggling and need more reassurance than normal, even though I’ve tried telling him. It’s especially hard because I can’t go over there to see him and with quarantine, he can’t come to my home because I have roommates who of course aren’t comfortable with visitors right now. I’m worried that he’s going to change his mind about me, and I’m worried about future family events and what this whole thing means for us in the long-term. But I’m hopeful. My therapist helped me a lot with calming my nerves and coping with this whole situation. I think I’m going to start seeing her regularly again.

Also, a lot of people mentioned they didn’t realize how uneducated they are about HIV. Here are a couple resources that can help:

https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/livingwithhiv/protecting-others.html

https://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/news/viral-supression-hiv-transmission/en/

https://58b1608b-fe15-46bb-818a-cd15168c0910.filesusr.com/ugd/de0404_6739336ddf8047799bda35e3f58aed77.pdf
 
Lastly, I received multiple messages from other HIV positive people. With something so stigmatized, it’s nice to remember that we’re not alone. I’ll try to respond when I can. We have to remember that we are so much more than our diagnosis and we are worthy of healthy love and dignity. Please take your medication every day, even when it’s difficult. A lot of has gotten better over the decades, and treatment and people’s behavior towards us will only improve.

 
From my bf:

Hi everyone! OP's boyfriend here. First I'd like to thank you all for the comments again. We both tried to read as much as we could and hear every opinion. To be blunt - my mom is a overly protective woman who's primary joy in life is her children. I can't think of a person who would quicker volunteer to sacrifice herself to save her children. It's beyond clear to me that her behavior is wildly irrational due to my life being at ""risk"". She is my family and I love her with all my heart. My girlfriend is also someone I love with all my heart. So when these two people are at odds I tend to become even more robotic than I already am. My natural reaction is to push this all in the past, handle the action points, reassess, and eventually cross the finish line. I think it is that desire to move past this ASAP that has me disjoined with my girlfriend. I'll address her aforementioned concerns with just a sentence or two. I try to engage in follow up discussions but I deep down believe they are adverse. It's one of those things built into my personality but, like anything else, can be improved with practice. If you have any advice for me at this stage I would love to hear it.


 Edit from my bf:

- I acknowledge my mom is completely and utterly in the wrong here. Her actions were/are detestable
- My action points are attending therapy with my gf, taking a course on HIV, updating myself on the latest research, and finally to lead the initiative to educate my mom in hopes of building a bridge between them and implement ideas to more effectively go about reassuring and supporting my GF

Edit from me:

I just want to say that while I appreciate the support, I think my bf has tried his best with what he knows how to do to help me with this. He knows he has things to work on and is looking for more constructive advice on how to be a better partner. I think that willingness to learn and become better is a huge green flag that I appreciate a lot. This is a pretty unique situation that I think most people would struggle with.

I know a lot of people are suggesting he cut ties with his mom. I think I would feel so guilty if that happened, even though I know it wouldn’t be my fault. My mother and I didn’t speak for years due to her toxic behavior and it was really painful for me. I wouldn’t want that for him. In a perfect world, I would like to find a way for her to become educated and accept me. Whether that’s possible is a whole other story. But I don’t want our relationship to come at the expense of tearing his family apart.

His current plan is to educate his mom because she thinks he’s going to die of AIDS. From there, he’ll reevaluate. Whether the that’s the best course of action is still being determined due to her current unwillingness to learn. I’m okay with giving that some time given he’s willing to step up in being more comforting and reassuring to me during this stressful limbo area. He said he will try, which I believe he will."
gaf7wj,"My (40M) wife (37F) just bought a dog while I was away, despite me repeatedly telling her not to. We aren't in a financial situation to own a dog. How do I proceed?",14292,0.89,4396,2020-04-30 00:26:01,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gaf7wj/my_40m_wife_37f_just_bought_a_dog_while_i_was/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gaf7wj/my_40m_wife_37f_just_bought_a_dog_while_i_was/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"We've been married for 12 years. Before that, we dated for 2.5 years. 

Hello R_A, I am the owner of a technology repair shop in a major US city. It's not part of any large chain, just an independent business. I opened it in my mid-20s, just about a year before I met my now-wife. We have a daughter (10F), and she is our only child. For this story, I'll call my daughter Erica.

Erica REALLY wants a dog. For the past 2 years, she has been begging my wife and me to get one, specifically a Labrador. She says that it is her ""dream"" to own one. Whenever she asked me, I told her that we can't afford it (We seriously can't. We spend around 90% of our earnings on food/bills/mortgage. My wife is a teacher, so while her salary definitely helps us stay afloat, it's not enough to have extra luxuries). I also told her that most dogs, including Labradors, need to be walked every day, and cared for often. She said that ""she'll be able to handle it,"" but every kid who wants a dog says that same line, and I don't think we have enough spare time, money, and energy to dedicate to another living thing in our house. Money is tight. 

My wife disagrees. She says that we should let Erica get a Labrador if she really wants one. She claims that Erica has ""good grades in school (mostly true), she doesn't ask for much (debatable), and that it's Erica's dream (true)."" She's not lying, but we just can't afford it. A few weeks ago, my wife was nagging me that this quarantine would be the ""perfect time"" to get Erica a dog, and she would have so much time to bond with it since she's not going to school. 

So I sat her down and talked about the finances. I explained that it costs, on average, several thousand dollars per year to own the breed Erica wants. We don't have that much disposable income. My store has also taken a massive hit from this whole event (my insurance didn't cover anything at all. Fuck them) Also, who would walk the dog every day? Erica is too young to go out by herself (especially during a lockdown). I certainly don't want to, and I don't think my wife will want to either. After I discussed this with her, she seemed a little uneasy about it, but agreed.

This past weekend, it was my turn to go the supermarket to buy groceries (my wife and I take turns going out to buy food). Between the driving, parking, and actual shopping, it took around 3.5 hours. I drove home and unloaded the bags into our mudroom. I then started picking them up to lift to the kitchen, while my wife helped. When I was carrying up my first bag, I got into the kitchen, and what do I see? A fucking Labrador sitting there, staring at me! I was absolutely shocked and livid. 

""What the hell did you do?"" I yelled at my wife. ""I told you we can't afford a dog!"" 

My wife explained that she got a dog because Erica really wanted one. Erica even named the dog already (Riley). My wife explained that she had been researching local animal shelters behind my back for the past few weeks, not ONCE asking or valuing my opinion on any of this. 

I'm furious. ""How did you adopt a dog AND get the pet supplies that quickly?"" I asked. It turned out that she didn't actually buy anything except 3 bags of dog food and one food bowl. No bed. No leash. No toys. So she got a dog, but not anything else you need to actually own a dog. I told her that this was ridiculous. WE LITERALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO OWN ANY PET. 

She told me that I was being ""bossy"" and ""rude"". She is an adult, so if she wants a dog, why can't she buy one herself? 

These are supposed to be mutual decisions. I told her that we had to agree on this together because it's such a large purchase. I told her that we had to send him back to the shelter immediately. The thing is, Erica seems so connected to Riley. She loves her, and the dog is very playful already, despite only being home for 4 days. Erica has been asking for a dog for so long. If she finally got one and then has it taken away from her just a week later, she would be absolutely devastated. 

I told Erica what will have to happen, and she broke down immediately. She says that if I return the dog, she will never speak to me again. TBH I kind of understand where Erica is coming from, but I just can't afford the dog. I talked to my wife again about this. She told me that the dog is staying no matter what. I am shocked about how little planning and how much deceit has gone into this. She already paid a $175 adoption fee without asking. 

Riley has nowhere to sleep (she just sleeps on the floor) and no toys to play with. My wife and I will not be able to give her adequate care because we just can't afford it, especially during a national crisis. If Riley ever had a health issue and we needed to visit the vet, we probably wouldn't be able to afford it (and even if we could, it would be just barely, and we'd have to give up something else we wanted). 

I do not want a dog and I do not have the means to care for one. However, there is a dog in my house right now. I have no idea what to do, and I will be fucked over no matter what decision I make. Reddit, please help me do what is best for my family."
gt5730,My husband eats so. much. food. (over 10k calories a day) and has gotten SO obese and I just don't fucking know what to do anymore.,14283,0.96,1712,2020-05-30 06:35:09,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gt5730/my_husband_eats_so_much_food_over_10k_calories_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gt5730/my_husband_eats_so_much_food_over_10k_calories_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"He didn't use to be like this. We got married when we were both 25, now we're 33 and he's gone from around 180 to over 450 pounds.

Looking at him fills me with horror and despair. He may as well have been diagnosed with terminal cancer because his size is going to have the same result sometime in the next 10 years if he doesn't stop. In my heart I no longer believe my husband will be here by the time I'm 50.

His medical problems so far:

- A mini stroke from a blood clot

- Abnormal heart palpitations

- ER visits both of those times

- Extremely high blood pressure

- Extremely high cholesterol

- Diabetes (didn't check his levels or take insulin as directed until I began reminding him)

- Inability to walk much (uses a scooter sometimes)

- Joint pain

- Lymphedema in one of his legs

- Sleep apnea and has to wear a cpap machine at night so he won't literally die from not breathing

- Five different medications that I manage the scheduling of or he wouldn't remember/not care/I don't know.

His diet:

- Fast food. Goes through drive thru's on his way to work, way home, and/or picks up takeout. Mcdonald's, Burger King, local Chinese joints, taco bell, KFC, popeyes, Domino's, Dunkin donuts, Chick Fil A, pizza hut, Arbys......... 

- Also gets all this delivered from uber eats whenever he feels like it, which is at least once a day. He even does it in the middle of the night.

- Everything else is just junk food like chips and other packaged snacks. All sorts of candy. Ice cream. Baked desserts. Frozen/microwave food like breakfast trays and sausages, burrito's, easy mac, basically anything you could find at a gas station convenience store. 

- All his meals are full of sugar, frying oil, butter, fat and grease, just the worst ingredients that are exactly what he needs to stop eating.

We're both WFH right now. I've watched him for a few days this week keeping a record of everything he ate (that I saw--if he ate at night or when I was in another room, I missed those) and then looked up the approximate caloric value of every item. Every single day was AT LEAST 10,000 calories. The worst day was a little over 14,000. A sedentary male of his age and height needs around 2500/day, just for comparison.
 
So this has been an ongoing problem for years and just keeps getting worse. Both his diet and the medical consequences.

I. Am. Terrified... that I'm going to be burying him, possibly before we even reach our 50's and get to enjoy old age together. I'm terrified I'm going to have to see the person I love most in the entire world die from a long, drawn out, painful accumulation of treatable illnesses. And some days I wonder if I'm not already watching that, in slow motion.

I have asked him so many times to please, please eat healthier. He will...he eats the healthy meals I make, but then he STILL eats junk food after. Or orders a second fast food dinner. He doesn't get it's not enough to combat the damage to his body.

I've also begged him to go to the doctor. He only goes when something is catastrophically wrong (see the emergencies in my list above). In fact most of the more ""minor"" problems in that list were only diagnosed because he happened to be at the ER for something major and they found it. 

I've begged him to see a doctor for a routine, non-emergency, check up specifically with the aim of building a support plan for weight loss and healthier diet. He says he'll do it then has excuses why he didn't. I myself have gone ahead and made a couple appointments for him to make sure calling people wasn't stressing him out, and then when the time came he just never went. Same thing with a therapy appointment. I set it up for him and he never went. I wondered and still do if there's something like depression at play, and this is the form it takes? But I'll never know if he won't talk about it to anyone. He doesn't even talk to ME about what's causing it. Beyond saying he just likes food and eating makes him happy.

I'm reaching a point where I feel like my heart is breaking. Like he's leaving me, even though our relationship is as strong as ever. I don't understand it. Why doesn't he care.

What else can I do to get him to take care of himself? Does he not understand that every day he doesn't change is one day closer to him dying young?

I live with this fear every single day and I just can't do it anymore, I need to find SOMETHING that will make him stop. I'm desperate. I cannot just fucking give up. Please give me any suggestions you can think of, I'll try anything.

TL;DR: My husband has been overeating for years, gained hundreds of pounds, nothing I say or try to do for him has made a difference. He's going to die. I know it. I need to convince him to just take that single first step towards getting better."

Our anniversary was in April and for it we had planned to do a road trip. Obviously that couldn't happen.

Last month he had brought up the idea of a road trip with me, his friends (22F & 24M) & his friend's girlfriend (24F). This would be happening next year. I thought this was a good idea as I am friends with his male friend and his gf but not necessarily his female friend. To tell you the truth, I've always been quite wary of their relationship (previous bf cheated on me and I've still got some insecurities I need to sort out).

I hadn't heard more about it since the trip was brought up in the first place so I asked my bf if it would still be going ahead. He said they had decided it would be a no-girlfriends-allowed trip. Eh, I was fine with that. Me and him could always go ourselves another time and I know friends need time to hang out without their partners.

Nothing more was said about it until today when I happened to glance at his screen and saw that they had made a group chat and were talking about it. I also saw his friend's gf was messaging in it. I asked him why she was in it if she's not going. He got defensive and instantly turned his screen away from me. I asked him why he did that and he said it's a private conversation - I then asked if I could look through the messages.

I found out that she is still invited and it's just me who's been uninvited. I would understand it if she was one of his friends, but she's actually not. In fact, I haven't heard him say one nice word about her. I guess my boyfriend just doesn't want ME there, but is fine with someone he dislikes. I feel so left out as I was made to believe I was part of this friendship group but none of them have even asked me why I'm not going.

Last week he confessed to me that he thinks he has started an emotional affair with a coworker of his. He said that this has been going on for a few months and he didn’t felt guilty. He said that he never touched her romantically, but he had feelings for both of us. He said he of course would choose me over any woman but still I’ve been hurting since I found this it and I don’t know what to do.

The girl is in her mid 20s, she hasn’t had any kids, she’s so pretty and she has a piece of his heart. I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong for him to catch feelings for another woman. This is devastating to me. Honestly I’d rather he had just fucked her and had no feelings for her whatsoever. That would be easier.

I don’t know how I can get past this. We have a family that I don’t want to break up and I still love him, and he’s ending everything with her, but now I feel broken. I don’t even know of I can trust him again.

I don’t know what to do.

Edit

I got preoccupied after I made this post. 

He said he did not feel guilty because it was an accident and he didn’t intend for anything to go as far as it did. 

There were a lot of messages exchanged between them and he said they went on 2 “dates”. He also said that they sexted and shared nudes but there was nothing physical.

He said he’d end the affair but right now we can’t afford for him to quit the job. He said that he was going to stop seeing her outside of work and said he has already blocked her on everything."

Yesterday I went to the store and got our groceries for the week, one of my usual chores. Wife had some friends over. As I was bringing in the food and putting everything up, one of them remarked how nice it was that I was taking care of that. I smiled and continued.

I expected my wife to say “yeah he’s great isn’t he?” or something similar to what I say about her every day, and move on. Instead, she said “he lives here too, it’s just as much his responsibility to be sure we have food to eat.”

Alright, very true. I voice my agreement. She continues. “Him taking in a few bags of groceries doesn’t mean he’s anything special.” …ok, again fair enough. Not a particularly loving or kind choice of words though. I don’t say anything back.

That still isn’t the end. As I finish everything up she goes on a two or three-minute monologue about how men need to step up around the house more, that they shouldn’t be applauded for doing basic household tasks, we (women) should demand more etc. etc.

Once again, a valid point in many situations but that’s where I got a bit irritated. First of all, my wife saying all of this in front of me as I’m doing stuff, with the catalyst of the conversation being one of her friends admiring me for doing that stuff, implicates me as part of that problem. Which is bullshit, I do every bit as much work around our home as she does. Probably a bit more honestly (also no kids fyi). If she wanted to talk about this - again, very valid observations in general - she should’ve detached it from me as an individual. ie “yeah he does so much around here, but so many other men don’t”

Secondly, it just felt weird and a bit hurtful that she would take this opportunity to give a sermon instead of just complimenting her husband. At least in front of him. Most of the things we do around the house are day-to-day stuff that needs to get done for everyone, not personal favors. Yet this doesn’t stop me from thanking and appreciating her for everything that she does, on a daily basis. Because we’re not co-workers; we’re spouses that should love, support and build up each other. Hell even some people at work say thank you on occasion for doing your job.

After her friends left I talked with her about these issues, she entirely disagrees. Repeating the same point about how I “don’t deserve” gratitude for this and that. Again, not the best attitude to have towards a spouse and a marriage imo.

What should I do from here? May seem like a small issue but it really did sting a little."
g2fikt,My little brother is out of control and I don’t think I know how to parent him properly,14220,0.93,1047,2020-04-16 19:35:24,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Back story-I (21f) am the legal guardian of my 13 year old sister “A” , 14 year old twin brothers “B and  C” and recently turned 16 year old brother “D”. Our parents died back 2015,they were driving home one evening after going on their date night and they were hit by a drunk driver,they died on impact. Our maternal grandmother then became our legal guardian, she was my rock and my co-parent but she unfortunately passed back in March 2018. I have since been the sole and legal carer of my siblings.

I am worried about my brother D. D has some really warped and disgusting views when it comes to women. He somehow excludes me and our baby sister A from his strong held views as we are “not like the other girls”.
Back in December 2019 I got a call from a parent from his school complaining about his online bullying of their daughter. Apparently my brother and some other boys had been dm’ing her and “saying”he wished she was raped, beaten and lit on fire. He didn’t use those words specifically but the memes he sent were very violent and could only be taken to mean as such. [extra info on the incident ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/fnlrusd/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
I confronted my brother and he tried to say it wasn’t “that deep”. He tried to say it was just memes and gifs but I wasn’t having that bs excuse. We got into big argument and eventually I took away his access to our wifi, I confiscated all his devices including his phone and had him on house arrest for 3 months. He was only allowed to go to school and back,so no friends no activities, no tv or internet, no phone, literally nothing. He eventually calmed down from the initial shock of the length of his punishment and then I had him write long letters apologising to the poor girl and her mother. We went and hand delivered it with our apologies. Thankfully they accepted our apology. I then continued to keep a close eye on him and I believed he was behaving.

Last month I did one of my random checks to see the kids internet usage and to check which websites they regularly used and who they spoke to or what they spoke off.  I noticed that D has been on what I can only describe as incel sites were disrespectful young boys and crazed grown ass men congregate to trash talk women and girls. I guess that’s were he learned the word simp. I never knew what it was but he’s been using it so much that the B and C were regularly using it. Our little sister A is really interested in makeup and the boys especially D have made several disparaging comments towards her dream job or the women she looked up to. A wanted to one day own her own make up brand. She no longer talks about her love for make up,fashion or design as freely as she once did. The boys are literally killing her confidence,her believe in herself,other women and even in men. 

I don’t know why D hates women or doesn’t respect them. He has been loved and cared for by women all his life. How do I help him? (I can’t afford a therapist or do much that cost money. FYI we already go to a free grief counselling program in our area. Also when advising please factor in that I am poor)

FYI: D is very popular at school, he has many friends (both online and real world) and he has many girls chasing him. He gets along easily with most girls/women and people in general are drawn to him. This behaviour has been going on since I would say late 2018(November/December) I only noticed it around April/May 2019 and took it very seriously from his online bullying incident. I don’t feel like he’s lost as he understand things when I sit down with him and explain why the things these men say is so hurtful and why he shouldn’t be replicating it. 

Edit- I gave up my childhood so that my siblings could have one. So I really don’t understand why he feels the way he does. He has no real responsibility other than to himself. The only thing the kids are responsible for are their chores(walking and feeding the dog, feeding the cat, cleaning their rooms, doing their homework and filling their laundry baskets and every three months we deep clean the house together from top to bottom)

I do everything else on the regular like cook them dinner, make them breakfast/lunch, sort out their laundry,clean the house, help them with their homework, drive them to and from their extracurricular activities,outgoings and their friends.

[an explanation on why I check up on their internet and phone usage ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2fikt/my_little_brother_is_out_of_control_and_i_dont/fnm1m3g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Edit: Some of the advice I will be implementing or looking into. He will be getting a job as soon as this whole lockdown is done(so that he has something productive to do and he gets to have a little money)
I will be looking into the big brother/sister program for all of them. I also will  be signing him up on some sort of sport related activity. He likes to run and so that may be something. The twins already take swimming. I will also be focusing on A more so she doesn’t lose her confidence and knows that I am always on her side. I will hopefully be able to find her something with fashion and make up, so she can pursue it with confidence and my support.

Edit: I know what the word simp is and I understand it can be used in a humorous way. That is not the way the D and his friends use it in. Also we don’t believe in  a god, so church, synagogue or mosque support/youth services aren’t an option but thank you."
cten9x,"Girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time""",14152,0.95,1899,2019-08-21 15:27:16,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cten9x/girlfriend_wont_go_to_sleep_until_she_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cten9x/girlfriend_wont_go_to_sleep_until_she_is/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So before your read, I need to say I have nothing against cuddling to sleep. I actually love it.

The problem I have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

And honestly I wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

But no, she doesn't want it like that. She absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

If I just start to get sleepy (wich I am because I want to sleep), she will get upset.

She absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because I have to keep my eyes open too.

She also needs sweet talk, wich I like but not when it's forced like that. She literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""I love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what I think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... And honestly I have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. And we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like I never say it.

But the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. And that can take some time. Sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

I know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with SO, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when I tell her I'm tired and I want to sleep.

If I say I'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""No ! Don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so I have no say in it.

Seriously, I think she's just being too clingy and childish. Is it unreasonable to just say ""good night I love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? I don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if I don't do enough.

I feel like I have no control over when I can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for SEVERAL HOURS.

Honestly I wish I could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but I can't. It's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when I'm tired.

Could I have some insight ? What do you think ? Am I being unreasonable ?

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT: Thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, I will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. I feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now I'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. I will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

iz68dn,My (26F) fiancé (27M) gave my brother (28M) a loan. He’s refusing to pay it back and now my parents hate my fiancé for threatening to take him to court and want me to break up with him.,14155,0.94,796,2020-09-25 02:57:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iz68dn/my_26f_fiancé_27m_gave_my_brother_28m_a_loan_hes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iz68dn/my_26f_fiancé_27m_gave_my_brother_28m_a_loan_hes/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"My brother is the golden child. All our life our parents have handed him things and have conditioned me and my sister to do the same. So, when my brother asked my fiancé for a loan, I stupidly didn’t tell him not to give him it. The thing is my brother never pays anyone back. I’ve given him £5k+ before and I’ve never seen a penny back. My brother was supposed to pay my fiancé back last week, and to no one’s surprise he claimed he didn’t have the money.

I think my fiancé would’ve just dropped it but my brother said some pretty degrading things about my fiancé and his family and their financial situation to his face. He then made a tasteless joke about how they (my family) should ask him for a bride price. Turns out, my fiancé is smarter than the rest of us and had my brother sign an agreement before he gave him the money. He’s now threatening to take him to court if he doesn’t repay him the money by the end of October.

My parents are furious because my brother definitely doesn’t have the money to repay him and they think my fiancé is greedy and selfish. They’ve been demanding I break up with him since because they don’t want someone like that in the family. My sister is egging my fiancé on because my brother has taken a lot of money from her before too and she thinks he deserves this. My SIL has been begging me to make my fiancé drop it since they really can’t afford it and they just had a baby.

My fiancé said he doesn’t want any of them (excluding my sister) coming to our wedding.

I don’t want to break up with my fiancé, but I also don’t want to get married without my parent’s being there. I know they’re in the wrong here, but I feel like banning my parents who never took the money is a bit extreme. What can I do to make them all come to an agreement?

TL;DR – My brother borrowed money from my fiancé and is now refusing to pay it back. He also mocked my fiancé and his family. My fiancé is now threatening to take him to court if he doesn’t repay him. My parents want me to break up with him and my fiancé doesn’t want to invite any of them to our wedding now.

Edit: he borrowed £15k.

Edit2: I agree with my fiancé taking my brother to court, that wasnt the point of this post. Please stop making comments implying I'm trying/tried to convince my fiancé not to.

Edit3: It seems like I worded this post really badly but I am not considering breaking up with my fiancé over this."

Two recent incidents really freaked me out though and I need advice.

I was driving on a the highway with a lot of traffic. We were going maybe 40 mph. She suddenly started tickling me and wouldn't stop when I yelled at her. I jammed on the brake and someone almost hit us from behind. I asked her what the fuck is wrong with her but she just laughed about it and told me to chill. I said ""what would make you want to do that?"" and she said ""idk, just felt like it.""

Then last Saturday I was hiking with her and I was standing near this steep cliff. I'm usually wary of her because you never know what she's gonna do even though it's usually just a prank or something. I let my guard down and she went behind me and pushed me towards the cliff and I swear I almost fell off. She did it hard and I ended up right at the edge. She was laughing so hard. I freaked out and started screaming at her and I may have been out of line but holy shit. She laughed about it at first but then she started crying and saying she was so sorry.

The next day she started texting me saying that she didn't mean any harm and she just ""didn't know"" that I would get so mad at her for doing that. Am I crazy for even thinking about this? Is it possible she's just immature and if I get back with her she'll be different? I'm kind of lonely and I really love her but this really made me rethink the situation because now I feel like she's legit crazy, not just fun crazy. Thanks for your advice."

When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn’t make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he’ll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don’t know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?

Edit: I’ve changed the ocd to perfectionist. I’m so sorry to everyone I offended!

Edit 2: I’m crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. Thank you to everyone who responded, I love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don’t get a lot of love in their lives. 

A little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn’t work. Because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. Neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. That was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job."

So after I went home yesterday, I cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

I called her, she accepted my call and said ""What?"" I told her ""I'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

I texted her, ""I need the copy of my house keys back, I'm breaking up with you.""

She didn't respond. I got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

I looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. So I texted her ""Where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

I drove back home and I noticed her car parked next to my house, I carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there I see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my iPad...) that's when I tell her ""What are you doing?"" 

She tells me, ""I'm taking back what's mine."" That's when I tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""Get off me."" She started kicking me and ran out the house.

I tell her to give my shit back or I will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so I whip out my phone and dial the cops.

She drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my iPad.

Cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and I told them what happened and I tell them the location of her house.

They sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

The cops start asking me questions like ""Is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later I got my stuff back.
She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

Now I'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

Edit: For everyone questioning of how she got arrested on the same day, she let the cops in and confessed what she has done."

Many people have been asking me to write an update about my last post. 

So that day my dad didn’t came home until 2 days later. My older sister and I told our parents that we needed to talk. Jane was in her room so that helped a bit. It was just the four of us (at first).

Since I took pictures of everything she did (all her selfies with our stolen things, I even took a picture of the note she wrote), I showed them all those pictures while I was telling them about the things I found on her phone.

My dad got angry and took her phone, tablet and then he went through her phone first. Since it caught her by surprise, my dad found more things she couldn’t delete. 

Apparently she also has another IG account. She has been talking to more than 10 boutiques there, asking them what can she buy from there with 20$. She also has been talking to strangers using that Instagram. 

One thing that made my dad really angry, was the fact that Jane was the one who started ALL the conversations with those strangers. He told her he’s going to delete both of her accounts. At this point Jane was crying and begging him not to.

He went through her whatsapp/her contacts. That’s when our parents told us that they allowed Jane to have (at most) 25 contacts in her phone (all should be friends from school and family). But she had a little more than 250 contacts, some of them were people from Venezuela and Costa Rica. Also, many of her contacts had weird names: one was named “Pikachu”, another one was “Harry Potter”, another one was named “Blocked” and so on. My dad asked her who are they and where did she get their numbers. She didn’t answer. 

Jane has been telling those strangers who my dad was, how much is his salary (my dad has a high salary) and the places he has been going to in the past few weeks (he travels a lot for work and is considered essential). She sent her selfie with my mom’s money to one of them and she even told them where we live (the area, not the direction itself). She also created another google account so my dad couldn’t monitor her (my dad had the password of her first google account). 

About the stolen things, my mom went to her closet and found the 200$ there, apparently Jane only wanted to take selfies with it. My parents just told her to never do that again. 

About her online behavior, after debating for a while my dad decided she can use her phone until 4pm. That’s it. They said they “can’t” leave her without a phone because she has online classes in the mornings. 

Finally the more concerning thing which is the note that I’ve found: My dad wasn’t surprised about this at all, he told us three of his coworkers have 14-16 year old daughters that cut themselves, “act” depressed, etc. Mom says there’s no way she can be depressed because she’s always enjoying her life and doing everything she wants. My sister and I suggested therapy, but both my mom and dad thought that if Jane was really depressed, she wouldn’t even want to do the things she likes/wouldn’t even enjoy them. We asked them if they think this is a normal behavior for a 11 year old. They didn’t answer. 

Basically they don’t care about the stolen things (they even said WE should lock our things from now on if we don’t want her to touch something from us) and they both think Jane’s note is just an angsty phase. Their main concern is about Jane talking to strangers online and giving personal information. 

I know this isn’t a good update, but I really tried to convince them about the therapy. My parents grew up in a little town from South America. They aren’t evil abusers, they just were raised in a time and place were mental health wasn’t something to be worried about. I do know Jane needs to feel loved and both my sister and I are currently trying to be closer to her (little steps, so we don’t freak her out) and understand her more. 

Other than that, I don’t think there’s much we can do. There’s no extended family who can persuade my parents. I can’t take her to therapy by force. There’s also a pandemic going on so any contact with strangers would be a big no from my parents (I know it could be online therapy, but my parents already refused therapy/aren’t willing to participate in one). People told me I should call CPS if my parents don’t do anything, but that would be such a drastic decision I don’t even think my older sister would support me with that one. My parents aren’t evil, they just don’t understand. My older sister and I decided we will support Jane as much as we can from now on. 

This will be my last update. I’m sorry if it wasn’t what people expected."

&#x200B;

We spoke via text and then I called her at lunch. It escalated where I was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that I should trust her.

&#x200B;

I stated they can be friends, but I expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because I know better.

I expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

She doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200B;

I don't think she cheated. I know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. Accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

&#x200B;

She's a wonderful woman, she's just not the woman for me.

&#x200B;

She wants to act like she's single, well now she is."

Especially those who are in similar situations and those who are in said situation but are the depressed party proved to give me some insight I sometimes did not even consider.

Also I am sorry for not being able to respond to everyone, I really tried my best to respond but there were so many comments I honestly couldn't keep up anymore, but rest assured I tried to read just about every single comment so your advice likely did not go in vain and I appreciate it.

I ended up having a really good think about my entire situation, trying to weight out whether I would be able to give her another chance to begin with, as despite my post would give away was actually something I struggled with, I was a bit of an emotional mess after all and honestly I sort of lack/lacked control over my emotions, as you might have noticed in some of my responses some times I seemed nostalgic, forgiving and nice other times I seemed vengeful, resentful and hateful, I will admit of the bat that this is all me and like I told some people in messages, I was and still am not in the best of places emotionally. But I have been working on getting my own emotions under control the past few days and I can say I am in a better place then I was a week ago, but it will certainly take some more time for me to recuperate from all of this.

Now off to what people were likely looking to see, what ended up happening this week that made me decide to make an update post?

Well, after all that thinking I decided regardless of what course I would be taking as some people suggested, it would be my decisions and my decision alone, not the decision of my parents, her parents, friends or people on the internet, mine alone. A decision I would be the one living with at the end of the day.

So I decided I would inevitably end up regretting it all if I did not at the very least talk to my wife and get some closure. So that is exactly what I did, two days ago I decided to invite her to our home to talk about what us, our relationship, what I would be doing going forward, her depression and so forth, basically just to get it all on the table.

Now, it would be impossible to narrate this entire conversation and honestly it was about some very personal stuff so I would not want to even if I could, so I will instead try to break it down and give a summary of sorts.

We ended up discussing our entire relationship, I must admit it was very awkward and confronting as it was about a lot of stuff myself in particular had bottled up for so long it was very hard for me not to start yelling. I told her I was exhausted, I told her everything we had been trying obviously had not been working, I told her I felt like a doormat, I told her she was not the person I married, I told her these 3 months had been liberating for me, I told her I was tired of it all, I told her that I felt like she wasn't doing anything to help herself, I told her she was not doing anything around the house, I told her a marriage is supposed to be a partnership but I felt like I was basically married to myself and that I was the only partner in this relationship essentially I unloaded the stuff I had been feeling for years by now, I told her I had a hard time not regretting the day I married her at this point and while it obviously really, really hurt her to hear, she told me she knew, she knew I was unhappy, she knew she had been anything but a partner, she knew she was horrible about it all, but she felt like whatever she tried she always ended up fearing getting better, getting demotivated to do anything and that when she left she almost felt like she had burdened me enough, that it wasn't for her, but for me, but that she went about it the wrong way and ended up blaming the therapist as an easy way out, while it was true the therapist had guided her in some way towards this decision, the decision she made was for the right reasons but the explanation she provided was tailored to her, not to me, which was disregarding the therapists advice entirely.

She said she felt guilty about it all and that, that guilt was just making her psychological state even worse, she said she hated seeing me going to work, coming home exhausted and having to clean everything up, until I just passed out essentially(Which I might add is a massive step for her as she never admitted this.) But she started admitting a lot of stuff and apologizing for a lot of things in our relationship, she said her time away made her realize how much I mean to her and how much she took for granted and that she should have done better a long time ago. To which I told her, I felt like I had been enabling her essentially, while I had tried to keep her to her medication and all of that, at the end of the day it was always me picking up after her which probably made it easier for her to slip back in to it all.

Well after hours upon hours of talking we ended up hugging for what seemed like over an hour before going back to talking and she basically said she understood if I would not take her back, she understood if I did not trust her to get better, she understood that I was tired, but she asked me to give her one more chance and she would do anything for it.

I have to admit, my mind immediately wanted me to go to the obvious option, which was not taking her back, not giving her a chance, but honestly in this discussion, she was the person I was once in love with, she seemed to take ownership of things, she seemed different somehow, but I also knew the risks coming with taking her back and honestly I was not about to pull another hail Mary. So I told her I would be willing to give it a shot, but it wouldn't be like before, not at all.

I told her, she would have to prove she was going to put in the effort first, before we could even begin. Firstly I told her she had to get a part-time job, I don't care what sort of job, whether it is waiting tables, at a clothing store or at some company, it is irrelevant, as long as she made sure to go every single time she was supposed to go, look presentable when going and made sure she did her best at said job. Secondly she knows I like going to the gym, as such she would be going with me at least 3 times a week, get in shape again, get some exercise in but most of all be busy in a healthy way. Thirdly, she is going to help her parents around the house while she stays there, no more sitting in her room along with her thoughts, groceries, dishes, vacuuming whatever, she was going to make an effort doing it every single day. Fourthly as some people suggested, we were gonna go on a date once a week, no more escaping, not wanting to go outside, feeling self-conscious, no more excuses. Fifthly, We were going to do couples counseling, I know we tried before but we will try again. Sixth, She is going to go to a new therapist, not lie about anything anymore and do what the therapist tells her. Seventh, if the Therapist suggests medication, she is going to take them every time she is supposed to take them and I will keep them with me and she will take them in front of me, no more forgetting, no more not taking them, no more complaining and if there are issues with them we will try different ones but regardless, she is going to stick to it.

I told her, once we are doing all that we can go to the next stage of repairing our relationship, but until she does them and keeps them up for a good few months there is not a single chance I will continue our relationship(And yes I know ultimatums are a taboo on relationship advice but I don't think I have much of a choice.) To my surprise, she actually agreed and to my even bigger surprise despite it only having been two days she was actually helping her mother and father around the house yesterday and has been looking for jobs, her dad also said she seems a lot more cheerful. Now I know there is a long road left and I know there is a good chance this won't work out and that I should not cheer too early, but honestly I am hoping I get my wife back and I felt I owe it to myself to at least allow her this one last chance, call me an idiot for giving her this chance but well, perhaps I am an idiot.

That was my update, I am not sure whether I will make another, I had honestly not even planned on making this one, I want to thank the people who responded to my other post again for their insight and advice and I hope all of you live happily ever after or something haha.

I have tried saying I am happy the way I am and that he was happy enough when we met. Why is it now an issue? I don't want to feel insecure but I am starting too. He also often talks about his hair as he's becoming bald, it's absolutely not a problem for me and I made some small jokes about it in the past but he's convinced it is a problem. He wants to get an hair transplant and he usually brings that up when he talks about my boob job, almost like he would undergo that procedure ""in exchange"" for my boobjob. He'd probably look better with more hair but I still love the way he looks now and I don't need him to change. We're having less sex lately (about one time every two weeks) and I'm always initiating, I'm starting to feel rejected and insecure. What should I do?"

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



I wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. First though, I'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. For the most part the community came through with useful advice. I really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


An now on to the update. I'm 39 now and my husband is 37. I was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. I told the therapist about the advice I got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. I went through with the pregnancy. My husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. He decided to stay. 


Not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. Reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. Our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. I see the world in a different way now that I have her. He loves our daughter with every bit of himself. Amazingly my love has grown for this man. He has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. I understand what he means. The happiness that I feel is beyond words. Both my husband and I are so thankful that we had our daughter. We talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. To top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


So thank you, reddit. Your support helped me through a difficult time. I hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


EDIT: Holy schmoly reddit. Pinned and gilded for the first time! Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. Thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. I have read and appreciate every one of them. I'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!). "

I’m sure that’s a conversation to be had when he’s much much older. Like an adult. I don’t know. But I’m confused right now. I want to show him pictures but is that wrong?? Is reminding him everyday harder? He’s been saying “I want my daddy to be here” or “my daddy is at work” and he doesn’t seem sad. Just confused. I know he feels all of this. My mother told me it’s a bad idea to show him pictures constantly. I just feel like... I don’t want him to forget his dad. This has been so hard. I just need some guidance. I start counseling Monday but I need other opinions. This morning we sat here and looked at tons of pictures of daddy and he smiled and seemed so happy. What do I do... I just want to be strong and do the right thing so my bubba feels loved and happy.

Today we had a conversation about money, family, and commitments. She basically told me that her money is hers alone to use, and I, being the guy, am supposed to pay for everything related to the family, including her allowance and expenses. Her argument is that her mum told her that a guy can easily cheat on the girl, leaving the girl with nothing, so she has to have her savings as a backup plan. She also told me giving birth is a big enough sacrifice, so I should be the one supporting the child.

Is it normal for a girl's expectation to be like this? I'm really confused and I don't know if I can handle supporting a family alone. This is really stressing me out. I mean, I don't mind being the sole breadwinner, but I probably need to earn 3x of what I do now to give my future child a good life.

We have gone through a lot together, and we are a pretty happy couple. We rarely argue and always communicate with each other well, even though most of our relationship are long distance. We really enjoy each others company. But after what I learnt today, I don't know what I should do."

So last week I posted here about my wife spending time at our house with an old ex that she used to have from high school. He had been coming over and working from home with her ever since COVID started. At first I thought nothing of it as they were just simply helping each other with their work. Then they started to hang out and stuff more. When I caught her laying down with her head in his lap I had enough. I told her he could no longer come over. She was mad and took offense to this but agreed. Most people here agreed with me that it was sketchy for her to do this. I was made aware that he could still be coming over during the day and leaving before I get there.

I ended up buying a camera that I could set up and hide while I am at work. I put one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The first day they were set up I saw nothing unusual. The second day was when it happened. The ex came over. At first they were just working, but then he started to get pretty touchy with her. It progressed until they needed up going to our bedroom and sleeping together. I was shocked. I wasn’t sure what to do. As soon as I saw my wife again I questioned her if she had been seeing him anymore. She denied it. I told her that I had cameras installed in the house. Her face changed completely then. She knew what I had seen. She immediately started crying. I told her to leave the house. She tried to apologize and explain but I wasn’t having any of it. 

Since then we have talked to each other once. I told her that I don’t see how anything can happen besides a divorce. She said she doesn’t want that and asked if I would go to couples counseling one time before making that final decision. I reluctantly agreed. I don’t expect it to work and I’m mainly doing it to humor her. I’m still looking and trying to contact divorce attorneys as I’m typing this. 

TL;DR - I figured out my wife has been sleeping with her high school ex while they are working from home"
j3u0ud,UPDATE: my ex boyfriend uploaded videos of me to pornhub without my consent and I found out two months later,13732,0.96,471,2020-10-02 18:31:34,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j3u0ud/update_my_ex_boyfriend_uploaded_videos_of_me_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j3u0ud/update_my_ex_boyfriend_uploaded_videos_of_me_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Hi everyone!! It’s been quite a while since my post that kind of blew up which I was surprised but super thankful for. I don’t know how to add links to the previous post but if you look at my profile you’ll be able to see the previous one. 

If you don’t want to read all of that, the most you need to know is that my ex put videos of me on pornhub without my consent after we broke up and I found out two months later. Some good stuff has happened, and I was so thankful for all the comments that I wanted to update in case anyone really wanted to know. 

So before I called the police, I gathered all evidence I could. I was too scared to even open the videos that I don’t have a screen recording of them up, just a screenshot of the title and thumbnail of the videos + his account name. As soon as I saw the acc name I knew it was him. I’m out text conversations I was able to find some stuff that would point back to the fact that it was probably him, I have text evidence of him saying the video was just for us and him saying he already deleted the videos after we broke up. When I called the police after recording a statement they assigned a detective to my case who was really nice and told me I had a good chance of things!! 

Because he has no previous record, he probably won’t end up in jail, which I’m fine with. As much as I completely despise him now, I would’ve always felt guilty if I sent him to jail. Things have been moving pretty smoothly since then, he has his first court hearing in a couple of weeks, and I’ll see more about what direction the case is going in after that. For now I just wanted to let everyone know that on that side of everything, it all went super smoothly. There’s no saying what’s gonna happen in the future, but for now everything is good. 

In terms of my mental health, it was really shit when I found out and after that. I was having a difficult time getting over it and realizing that he didn’t care for me to do something like that and that was hard. Because even after we broke up I still held him in a good light, not always, but there were a lot of times where I missed him and considered getting back together. But I’m so much better now. I started seeing someone else who has been really good to me and supportive. Im doing a lot better. 

Thank you to everyone who messaged me directly for support and sending me information and links. You guys are truly amazing fucking people. To take time out of your day to send that just like, it meant so much so thank you. <3"

-he is female to male transitioned, so he started life assigned female at birth and transitioned later. 

-he already 'transitioned', I am still learning the terminology and stuff but he had his breasts removed and he has been on hormones for a long time, several years

-i don't plan to break up with him and I assume he's discussed things with his therapists

if I can't answer all the questions that come up / reply to all comments I'll dump em into an update eventually but thanks to everyone who took time to educate, drop resources, and just generally be nice. 

so first off, there's some things I need to ask my boyfriend privately but I don't really have anyone to ask the general questions I have and I don't want to embarrass him or make him feel like I'm interrogating him, lol. I know this sub has people from all walks of life and I figured someone had to have been in a similar situation. 

My boyfriend and I started dating before quarantine, but we ended up separated by it and doing zoom dates and stuff. we didn't sleep together before the quarantine happened and are just starting to get together for in person get togethers now.  


Things have gotten pretty hot a few times but he ended up stopping me before we got too far. the last time was on Wednesday night, and tbh things got weird, he seemed really uncomfortable and ended up leaving abruptly. 

today he sent me a message saying that he had something to tell me and he told me that he's  trans and was born female. he's had guys end relationships over it before so he was scared to tell me but wanted to. I told him that didn't bother me and I still want to have a relationship. 

I've never been sexual with someone in possession of a vagina but that I can learn on the fly. what I'm looking for is: how do I support him? what can I do to make sure that he feels good about himself? if you are trans, is there anything you wish your partners knew or did out of the gate? is there anything special they do that made you feel loved? did you want them to tell friends/family that you met/did you tell them, or no? if you've dated someone who is trans, same questions. I know everyone's different but I wanted to get some additional advice and support!"

Problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of Down syndrome. A follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has Down syndrome.

I want an abortion because I am not prepared to raise a child with Down syndrome. This is not me bashing Down syndrome people by the way, it’s just not something I’m prepared to do. My GF doesn’t want an abortion though so there’s nothing I can do about that.

At this point I’m considering just ending the relationship. I’d pay whatever I’m required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. My GF obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but I feel like I have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with Down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

Anyway, I’m asking for advice about how to break the news to my GF. I obviously have to tell her ASAP so that she can make an informed decision.  But I don’t want to come across as manipulative.

I realise I’m coming across like a heartless prick here, but I genuinely care about my GF and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally"

first of all, thank you all for the support, I tried to read almost every message and comment but there was a lot so it’s hard.

Some of you thought I was super naive and I feel like I needed to just hear the truth straight up and after posting and reading I decided to end it pretty quickly.

Just for some context our relationship other than this situation honestly hasn’t been great either. We’re different races and his parents don’t accept me (he has strict asian parents). He’s extremely childish and immature, spends all day playing video games and we do honestly constantly argue, the only thing that was good about our relationship was the sex part and now that that’s gone because of how he’s acting there’s truly nothing good left in it.

The plan was to break up with him as soon as he got home from work and of course, today was the day that he was staying late at his job and I just wanted to get things done and over with because it was eating me up inside. When he finally got home he just ignored me and part of me just wanted to ignore him back and not deal with it but I knew what needed to be done.

So I went to our room where he had been since he got off work, he was playing video games and I told him that we needed to talk which he rolled his eyes at. You guys said to be as direct as possible so I told him that I was breaking up with him because he’s manipulative and childish. 

immediately you could see the change in his face from smug to scared. he asked if I was seriously gonna throw everything away because of a disagreement and I told him it was bigger than that. he said if I wanted to leave him because I can't fulfill his needs then to go right ahead.

So I turned around to leave and he said wait. This is where i lost it, all the last months boiled over and I said how manipulative and disgusting he was all because he couldn’t cum in me for a little while. that he was a child and if he couldn’t figure out how wrong he was at 26 then there was no fixing him. 

I also told him how pathetic he was for putting on such a show by crying while watching porn just to try to make me feel bad. He said it wasn’t a show he just was upset that we were fighting all the time and he happened to be watching porn

he also doubled down by saying that “ cumming in his woman is important” and brought up his boundaries again. and I told him how much bullshit that is and that he can’t set boundaries on my body. we were both crying a lot. he then admitted that he acted this way to deter me from taking out my IUD.

After that, I left to go to my parent's house and he’s tried calling and texting (all apologetic now) but I don’t feel the need to ever talk to him again

di16ij,(UPDATE):My MIL exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). Who had no idea. Wants him to divorce me.

Hubby and I are solid. She then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the Christian thing. 

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick update about a post I made 5 days ago on here. You were very kind to me. Thank you. It got locked and deleted because I had the wrong username so I've just made another account and added the ""throwRA"" to my normal username LullabelleAnabelle, so I can make a quick update for this subreddit. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to my post because I posted it on another subreddit too. A lot of you suggested I go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. Thank you everyone. You're wonderful. 

To clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if I may). I'm not American, European born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. We met at his friend's wedding where I did the bride's makeup (I'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). We had some serious words, mostly where I told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and I fell hard. And you guys are so right, he is the best person I have ever met. He's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. And he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. So I think I'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. He's just my world. 

It hasn't been easy. A few things have happened and I can't honestly say that I'm better off for it. But I'm trying.  Again, really not a troll post. I'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. This is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

I didn't know how to tell him. Or what I wanted to tell him. A bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, I didn't want to show him ever. So, I told him I could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. They aren't particularly easy to read. Those men weren't very nice to me. They had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. And they had gone to jail. 

He got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. That I didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if I didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second I was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. He'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. He wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. He said he was so scared that I would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. And he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. They were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. Nothing malicious or accusing. 

I thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. She'd taken pictures of the parts where I described things that had happened almost too vividly and then I had pointed out ways I could have defended myself and questioned why I hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way I looked and wanting them to do those things to me. Its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. It was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so I didn't have to think about the ways I could have stopped it. Maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all I had, I never went to therapy. She put in her message that I had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof I was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

His sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. And to the other siblings and some others in the family. Fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

Things haven't been going well. My husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. He's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. He won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. He owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. But I'm trying to get him to not do that. It's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. I don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

As for me, I'm just in a fog. I don't know how to process what she did, so I'm not going to until I'm ready. My husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. I think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. I'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. It sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. I hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows I thought like that about myself. I never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. Its just shit. 

I won't be posting on here again. 
Thank you all for your lovely words. I hope you take care.

Edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. And thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much I must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. No."

I never expected the amount of replies I ended up receiving on my post, nor did I even realize the gravity of my wife's betrayal at the time of posting. I had a lot of people comment or reach out asking for an update, so here goes:



I had made the decision that until we knew if she was pregnant or not that I just wanted some distance to think/cool down from my initial anger and shock. I told the wife this, and spent a few days over at a buddy's house trying to process everything. Ironically, my wife's birthday fell within the days I wasn't home, so she's been extremely pissed at me, too. She ended up informing me this morning that she got her period and asked if that means I'm coming home now.



I'm still feeling extremely betrayed by her, and although we did dodge the bullet this time around, I have so little trust in my wife now that I don't know if our relationship will be salvageable. I'd rather be a young divorcee than feel like I need to keep my condoms in a lock box or something to prevent my own spouse from tampering with them. I'm not 100% sure if therapy would even be worth it considering she's still infallible in her own mind, but I guess if she sees the light and genuinely apologizes soon I'd be willing to pursue it just because I do love her. 



As far as I'm concerned, the ball's in her court and if she wants to try and make this right its going to take some actions on her part that show she's truly sorry and willing to earn my trust back. I'm not sure that even if she does make the effort that our relationship is repairable at this point, but maybe after some extensive couple's therapy we can figure out exactly where our relationship went wrong where she thought that behavior would be acceptable.

This has made my husband visibly depressed and a lot less like himself lately. Tonight when I got home from work he had our two kids go spend the night at his mother’s place and had made us dinner. After dinner he sat me down and told me that I needed to prepare myself for what he was going to say.

He then proceeded to tell me about his affair. To sum some things up he essentially had been doing sexual things with his cousin since she “seduced” him when she 13 and he was 16 This sexual activities went on through their adulthood up until he started to date me. After we got married things didn’t happen between him or his cousin until around 4 years into our marriage when she supposedly convinced him to continue their sexual activities on the side. We’ve been married for a little over 15 years for context. This has continued up until 3 weeks ago as you can imagine. 

He told me to take it as I will and he’ll accept anything I choose to do considering our marriage. His cousin apparently was a lot more than just some sex fling. 

I’ve never would have expected my husband to be cheating. He never did anything that would give it red flags like coming in late or leaving hair of another woman around. I’m at a standstill and not sure where to go from here. I haven’t been able to say anything to him after he was so blunt about it. I’m still crying some now, I don’t know where to go from where. 

Any suggestions are welcome."
hjq4xz,My (28m) boyfriend (33m) found out he has an illegitimate son (14m).

My boyfriend of 3 years in August got a weird call from a social worker a few days back. I should note that my boyfriend is bisexual and has had sexual relations with women in years past, well, turns out when he was 19, he got a girl pregnant. I asked him what he knows about her and he said basically nothing, they met during a school event (he went to bowling green) and they hooked up and he never heard from her again. 

I naturally had a lot of questions following that. The social worker, we’ll call her Grace, came down to meet us (him specifically) and gave us the run down if we seemed fit to take in the child. Unfortunately, his biological mother tried commuting suicide a few weeks back and it left her in a vegetative state. Her mother helped the social worker track down my boyfriend. All they knew of him was he studied Communications at bowling green and that’s how they found him, class of 2009. 

It’s been a very confusing scenario, Grace offered us a choice. She said that we are fit to take in Michael (fake name) assuming the blood test comes back positive, or he’ll be placed on a foster family roster. The chances of him getting actually adopted are slim to none. My boyfriend said if the blood test comes back and he is the father, he will take him in. I was not consulted first but I think it’s the right thing to do. 

Blood test came in, he’s the father. Michael is supposed to move in on Friday. What can I do? What should I do? I’m terrified. My boyfriend is nervous and things just aren’t the same right now. There’s an entire teenage human being moving in on Friday and we’ve barely talked about it. Grace comes by daily to check in on our routine. We both work full time but we’re home all day because of covid. We bring in a decent amount of income so money won’t be an issue. We have a spare bedroom that’s furnished so we won’t have to do much in terms of that. I’m just scared you guys. Have any of you been blindsided like this before? I literally have no preparation for a situation like this. I have so many questions. I need all the support I can get. Thanks

Edit: I apologize for calling him “illegitimate” I just thought it was a good word to describe the situation whilst keeping the title short. I understand how that can be offensive.

Edit 2: I’m seeing a lot of reoccurring questions but the most frequent is why his grandmother wouldn’t take him in. Well, she’s in her late 90s and has a live in nurse so I don’t think she’s ever been a viable option.

Edit 3: A lot of you brought to my attention that his grandma would have been in her 60s when she had his mom, upon further investigation (texting grace) we found out that it is not her biological mother. This hadn’t crossed my mind thanks for pointing it out."

I have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. I'm pretty much dead to the world when I take them. Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while I was knocked out despite me saying that I wasn't up for sex before I fell asleep. I woke up that day because I was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. He didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200B;

Now for the update. after I found out what happened, I went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. I'm so incredibly lucky to have him. It was from his house that I made the last post. After that post, I was replying to the comments until I fell asleep. The majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that I need to break up with him and report him to the police. That was something I didn't wasn't to have to do. When I woke up in the morning, I had almost 600 more replies and I got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what I was going to do. So that is exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

I had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why I wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. I went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200B;

So I called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. I started to explain everything to him and why I had to go away for a while. The conversation was going okay at the beginning. But then it took a turn. As soon as I brought up the fact that I wold him no to sex before I feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. He started yelling. He started throwing things. He got scary violent. Telling me that he knew I was insinuating that he had raped me. Saying I was accusing him of something very serious. I hadn't said to him that he had raped me. I hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that I was going to give him another chance.

&#x200B;

Then things took another turn. In my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. I don't want to come off that way so I am not going to disclose what happened. I'm still trying to process everything and wondering how I could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200B;

I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. You have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me I was the one who was wrong. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I was wrong. But I think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision I had made. Maybe it was better that way because now I know for sure. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now I'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some people have asked of he is now my ex. I guess I didn't really directly say that he is. We are no longer together. And never will be again. Even if I decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: It's come up a lot. People are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. My brother did report him. Another thing people keep asking is what happened. Call me an attention seeker if you want. I don't care anymore. What I left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. If my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. It's so embarrassing, not just that I was almost taped but that my brother found me like that."

I am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

I thought that I had a pretty happy marriage with ""Jonas"". We have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. We have twins (f8).

Jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. During this time he will visit us and we will visit him. It is I convinient but he earns really good. So good so that I needn't work if I didn't want to.

During all those years I have never suspected him if cheating. He was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

So this comes all of the blue for me. Jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
A woman knocked on my door. She introduces herself as ""cherry"". When I asked her what it was about she broke down crying. I took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about Jonas. Apparently she and Jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

We were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. He has 2 different sets of social media accounts. And as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

At first I was livid and screamed at her. Till I calmed down as she was just a victim.

Apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if I visit) trough some bank statements. She searched his keys and went snooping. There is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

We both cried our eyes out together. Cursed out Jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

She is not legally married to Jonas as he sold her the ""I don't believe in marriage Spiel"". The only legal spouse he has is me. I know I have to divorce him but maybe I just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. Also should I keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

Edit : I guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

Thanks for the few helpful advices I have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. I honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but I guess it's if I wanted that I needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

Thanks for the people that did tho. Cherry has left and I will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. I will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings"

Basically everything all moved forward today.

So I basically thought I'd be best to reach out to my daughter so I messaged her along the lines of ""hey, I know you're not talking to me now but I think we really need to talk."" To my surprise, she agreed and came over very quickly. Basically I said to her that as she's an adult, I won't sugar coat things now - I'm really not in a good place and her mum getting married to her girlfriend and asking me to be best man is a bit too much for me when I'm struggling to move on with my life. She said she sort of understands but it hit her close to home - she then came out to me as a Lesbian herself!

She said she's known for a while now (she told her mum/my ex a while ago but wasn't sure how to tell me) and because of the way I reacted to the wedding, she was worried I wouldn't be able to accept it. I reassured her that I love her dearly and I'm proud of her for being honest with me, and stressed the way I feel about her mum and her now fiancée is nothing to do with the fact they're lesbians but because she's my ex wife and I can't just turn my feelings off like that - I'd feel exactly the same if her mum was marrying a dude. We hugged it out, and she said she'd talk to her brother's and see if she can get them to come around - because they live with mum and see the fiancée often, they see her and love her a lot so they don't understand. I said to her I can't promise I'd go to the wedding eventually but if I feel up to it I may try but it will he hard for me.

While she was here, she facetimed her mum from her phone and I got chance to talk to my ex. I basically was honest, said I feel like she blindsided me and sprung it on me without thinking about how I feel - especially putting me on the spot about making me her best man, I said the invitation to the wedding was one thing but that was a bit too much for me. She took it all in and apologised, and admitted it's because she's all loved up and her family are giving her all the platitudes about how happy and proud they are so she got caught up in the moment.

She asked me how I feel about it now. I said in all honesty, it's a bit too much to consider at the moment but I definitely am not going to be her best man regardless. She understands, and said she won't expect that of me. But if I didn't want to go to the wedding itself, would I be interested in going to just the reception? I said in all honesty I don't know if I can. And she shouldn't expect me to. She agreed and said she'll leave it to me and will try to understand if I can but would be made up if I can. The boys were there so I asked if she could put them on but they didn't wanna talk to me. Honestly, that feels like a punch in the balls so I left it there before it started me crying and she saw it, and let the daughter leave so I could be on my own - I've never liked her to see me too emotional especially cry.

So there you have it. We've all ""made peace"" as such but there's a long way to go yet.

Edit: a lot of people have said about her cheating. Whilst she did meet her now finance before we split, I don't believe there was physical intimacy. Possibly an emotional thing but I don't believe they got together until we split. 

Edit 2:a lot of people have picked up on not showing emotion around my kids. I do show emotion around them - I'm loving, funny, affectionate, humble etc and I do show sadness at things like funerals but I generally don't like them to see me cry especially at things like this. 

Tldr: met up with my daughter, had a chat and spoke to my ex and had it out - she apologized, invited me to the reception only and I said I'd need to think about it. Boys still don't want to talk yet but my daughter is going to try and talk to them."
hi0hxt,My (26F) boyfriend (29M) won't use his real voice and it's becoming a problem,13449,0.95,1267,2020-06-29 19:38:22,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi0hxt/my_26f_boyfriend_29m_wont_use_his_real_voice_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hi0hxt/my_26f_boyfriend_29m_wont_use_his_real_voice_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"My (26F) boyfriend (29M) and I have been dating for just over five months now. In all other areas, things are going pretty well thus far. We've met each other's friends and I'm planning on introducing him to my family soon.

My boyfriend's voice seems to fluctuate a lot, way beyond what is normal. 99% of the time he'll speak in this heavy, guttural voice that sounds like an action hero or something. I know that some men have a deeper voice naturally but my boyfriend's voice is far deeper than anyone else I know IRL. It's practically a growl.

But as we've been spending more time together, I've noticed that there are certain times his voice sounds way different. For example, a few days ago I asked him a question in the middle of the night when he was almost asleep and his voice sounded much more normal. Whenever he's excited or taken by surprise, he lets this other voice slip. This other voice is much higher in pitch and more... nasal-y if that makes sense? It's nothing like the voice I associate with my boyfriend.

When we first started dating, I remember noticing that my boyfriend had a voice that was lower in pitch than average but never thought much of it. But I was watching a saved video of the two of us from a few months ago and comparing now to then there has been a significant drop in pitch. His voice is so gravelly now that he basically sounds like the Christian Bale Batman voice if the guy had also been a chain smoker.

This didn't really seem like an issue until I was thinking about it the other day and I brought it up to my BF just out of interest. What I wasn't expecting was for him to absolutely shut down, telling me to 'mind my business' and that his voice had 'nothing to do with' me. Obviously this relationship is new but he's never flipped out at me like that before. He's actually usually a pretty good communicator.

How should I handle this? I don't really understand the issue here or what is getting him upset, but I get the feeling it's something we need to talk about if it's making him react like this. I don't know why he'd put on a voice that is so much deeper than his natural one, especially considering nobody really talks like he does in real life.

TL;DR: boyfriend is angry because I brought up him putting on a way deeper voice all the time, I don't know why this is an issue?"

I don’t usually do much for my birthday, just normally go out to eat.  Yesterday being my birthday, I asked my girlfriend if we could dine out at one of the local Mexican restaurants on my town after I got off work.  She said probably not, as she was going to be pretty busy that day, which is understandable as she is currently going to school and is nearing midterms.  A couple of hours after getting home from work, I got a call from her asking to pick her up from the very restaurant I asked if we could go to, as she went out with her friends and got a little tipsy.  I of course went ahead to pick her up, as I didn’t want her to drive home drunk.  I haven’t said a word to her since, and she doesn’t seem to understand what’s wrong.  I feel hurt and unloved, and don’t know how to approach this."
e35vj6,I (26M) found out my fiance (27F) possibly gave a stripper a handjob at her bachelorette party,13393,0.98,1721,2019-11-29 04:36:32,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e35vj6/i_26m_found_out_my_fiance_27f_possibly_gave_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I deleted my earlier post because I was so messed up about it at the time I realized it wasn't healthy to have a conversation about it yet.  I made that post right after the guy called me in an attempt to cope but it didn't work. My thoughts were getting too dark and I needed to completely separate myself from the situation for safety. After holing myself up at my parents place and surrounding myself with people I could trust, my head is back on straight and I'll fill in those who asked for an update.

A quick recap for those who didn't see my original post. I will refer to my fiance as Jane. One of the bridesmaids husbands contacted me and told me he had seen something that made him suspect Jane had been sexual with a stripper at her bachelorette party. ANY sex or romantic kissing outside that relationship was a complete deal breaker that was established when the relationship had begun. When I asked him for details, he indicated a handjob in a roundabout way. When I asked if he could be mistaken or misinterpreting a text or overheard conversation, he kept insisting he was 100% sure. I personally know the bridesmaid, I think she was feeling guilty and she was using her husband as some sort of a proxy informant to keep my girlfriend from coming after her when I confronted her.

When I got off the phone with the guy, I was so destroyed about it I just shut down. I had just had my own sort of non-bachelor-party party at home playing WOW Classic with some friends. So to hear this news after such a wonderful day hit extra hard. My cousin who has been friends with Jane since childhood went to the party with her, so I decided to try to calm down and wait until the next day to ask her if she saw anything. At this point I was still hoping this was some sort of misunderstanding or mean prank. Jane didn't live with me, and she was planning on staying the night at her parents home so I knew she wouldn't show up unannounced. I basically laid in bed all night staring at the dark ceiling, listening to The Doors and Opeth, trying not to lose my mind.

I waited until noon the next day to call my cousin. I wasn't able to get through the first 5 times I called, red alarms going off like crazy now. So when I suspected she was avoiding me, I went over to my parents place and used my dads office line. When she finally answered the phone and realized it was me, the somber tone in the voice of a normally annoyingly upbeat 23 year old party girl, pretty much told me everything I needed.

Me: I heard things got a little crazier than usual last night.

Her: Yeah...

Me: I think you already know why I'm calling don't you?

Her: Yes... (obviously holding back tears at this point)

Basically long and weeping cousin story short; I found out Jane did indeed give a stripper a hand job, along with several other women, some of whom are in LTR's or married. That they then decided to leave the house they were at and drive intoxicated to the strip club afterwards where Jane and a few other women had ""private"" dances. My cousin tried to argue that this doesn't mean Jane doesn't love me, and it was just meaningless fun that got out of hand. This fucking infuriated me, I didn't shout at her, but I told her if that's what she thinks, she has no idea what love actually is. At this point I informed my parents and brothers what was going on, and of course my mother starts crying. Another person hurt by this stupid bullshit.

I spent the rest of the day laying in bed at my parents house staring at the ceiling ignoring Janes calls and texts. I know some people have more open relationships and can get past this stuff, but I'm just not that guy. I'm monogamous all the way to the center. I eventually cancelled everything and lost a bunch of deposits. I know it's a bitch move but I broke up with Jane over text. I decided it was best to just walk away clean with no serious confrontation. There was nothing to gain by shouting, arguing, making accusations and calling her names. When people are cornered like this when they do something wrong they can lash out and I didn't want to have the woman I was about to marry say horrible shit to me in some sort of defense of her behavior. I am fucking heartbroken and feel betrayed and that kind of shit isn't going to help. I just sent her a text explaining I know what she did. I explained I don't want revenge, I'm not interested in humiliating her or her friends and spreading it around, but it is a sure sign that we aren't right for each other and it is over with no possibility of reconciliation. I waited until she responded once to make sure she got the text and have blocked her on my phone and all social media. I gave the crap she had at my place to my cousin to give back to her and I haven't heard anything from her or her family since.

I still feel like hammered dog shit, but I am doing better as far as not feeling like a blackhole is sucking me inside out. But this wasn't like the breakups I had in highschool and college. Something broke inside me this time that can't be repaired like before. My confidence is completely destroyed in my body now. I keep thinking what it was about the stripper guy that is so incredible that he could make seemingly faithful woman cheat and potentially throwaway everything. Was it bigger muscles, bigger dick, better looks, better personality? I'm not a super model, but I'm decent. I don't act like a bitch or a pussy. Or am I just stupid? I was 100% sure of this girl, yet I got cheated on right before our wedding. This kind of crap really take a mans soul grinds it up, eats it and shits it back out.

\*\*\*Update: Someone from her camp finally contacted me. Her stepdad called me tonight to ask what was going on and if there's anyway to fix things. I didn't give him any details, I just explained that Jane stepped outside the bounds of forgivable behavior in our relationship, and there's absolutely no way to salvage things, and any time spent trying by any party is time wasted that would be better spent moving on. When I said that I could tell he understood what it meant and basically what happened. He's a pretty laid back old-school Hispanic dude, said he's sorry things didn't work out, and wished me well. Wasn't super close with the guy, but I will miss hanging out in his garage shooting the shit about motorcycles and stuff.

\*\*\*2nd Update: I just got done talking to the bridesmaids husband again who first called me and let me know what was going on. I don't know him, but I am a friendly acquaintance with his wife. Apparently what happened is his wife became extremely uncomfortable when the some of the women started grabbing and stroking the strippers dick, and she left and went home. When he asked her why she came home early she got upset and spilled the beans. More than likely to protect her own marriage if it got out, I would guess. Anyway, dude made a moral call and decided the husbands and boyfriends of the women had a right to know how their significant others were acting when they weren't around, and he made his wife give him all the contact info she had. Seriously, I owe this guy so much. Had I found out about this a few years down the line, the end of the relationship would have been so much worse. His wife still won't talk to me, but It doesn't matter now. I told the dude when things settle down I'm going to take him out and buy him every beer in the bar. Had this dude not had the moral fortitude to make the call, I may have never known.

Edit2: I got the chance to read the comments you guys left. Last week was a very stressful, shitty week and after how well talking to her last night went, I've been smiling at every little thing. Even though I can't respond to each of you, thank you all for giving me more things to smile at.

I posted an hour ago an update to my [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/epo2lu/i_caught_my_roommate_20f_masturbating_to_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) a few days ago that got removed by the mods because it wasn't on an throwRA account. I got a few DMs and a comment on my original post asking what happened to the update, so I decided to repost it on a properly named account. If this isn't allowed/or people think this is stupid feel free to downvote or remove it mods. People seemed curious about what happened so here it is:

I posted a few days ago about my roommate masturbating to me, and asked for advice on how to talk to her about because it make me uncomfortable. I got a lot of good advice, so I wanted to write a very brief update for anyone curious.

Last night I asked if we could talk about what happened last Friday, and she agreed. I told her I just wanted to tell her how I felt, and she didn’t have to say anything if she didn’t want to. I explained how it made me uncomfortable that she was using my pictures in that way and that no matter why she was doing it, it wouldn’t change my opinion of her, but it had to stop if we were going to keep being friends. I asked her to delete the photos, and she agreed so we went on her laptop and deleted them. She asked if she could take a walk and then talk to me, so she did and came back half an hour later. She said she was trying to figure out who she was sexually, and that she just wasn’t sure and when she started thinking about other girls, I was the face that came to her mind. She didn’t have feelings for me, just in her words “someone who looks like you but isn’t you.” I told her that no matter what she could always talk to me. And then she looked me in the eyes, we kissed, and spent the night passionately fucking.

No of course that’s not what happened. We hugged, and it’s like a huge weight was lifted off my back, the tension is gone, and I have my best friend back. Thank you for all the nice comments.

tl;dr talked to her honestly and everything is much better now"

&#x200B;

I've been together with my GF (we'll call her Kim) for a little over 8 months now. We don't live together but she only lives about a 5 minute walk from me. I would have described the relationship before this week as pretty slow. Neither of us really wanted any big commitments yet so outside of date nights, netflix and occasional hook ups the relationship has been pretty laid back. 

That was until this last weekend. My birthday was Saturday and my brother came to town and we were gonna have a small party. I invited Kim obviously and she seemed really excited. Kim claimed she had spent over a month thinking about what to give me after I supervised her with a pretty expensive present for her birthday. I should have picked up something was off here when she avoided seeing me face to face for about a week before the party but I put if down to other things. 

Well, Saturday comes and we were having a party with about 9 people. Kim made a big show about getting everyone together because she wanted to give me her present in front of everyone. Well, this is where things get crazy. For my ""birthday present"", Kim got a MASSIVE tattoo on her back. Of my face. Underneath my face there is text saying ""Mine forever"". The silence was deafening, it didn't help that the tattoo was not even half done.

I was not ready for this and I had to go into the other room just to breathe. During this time my brother and Kim got into a small fight as my brother called her crazy multiple times. Most of the people were gone by the time I was able to even leave my room including Kim.

Me and her have been fighting non-stop since then too. She is claiming that I completely disrespected her in front of everyone and is now saying that i'm ""some fuckboy who doesn't love her at all"". She has refused to come talk to me until I and my brother apologize for ""embarrassing and disrespecting her in front of everyone"".

This is completely out of my comfort zone and I have no clue what to do. My brother has been telling me just to break up with her and ignore her. But I just can't do that. Before Saturday I did feel a spark with her. I did like her a lot. But this is all just way to much. Any advice on what I should or can do here would be appreciated."
gmoulm,Adoptive parents stole me from bio dad,13248,0.96,798,2020-05-19 19:15:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gmoulm/adoptive_parents_stole_me_from_bio_dad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gmoulm/adoptive_parents_stole_me_from_bio_dad/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"So i am a 22f living independently. 

Before i get into it I just want to give a bit of backstory.

I was adopted as a baby by my adoptive parents and raised believing that my bio dad abandoned me when he found out my bio mom was pregnant and that my bio mom gave me up because she was too young for a baby. 

I had a hard childhood as my parents never wanted to discuss my adoption and would get very uncomfortable if I brought it up and sometimes very angry and start shouting if I talked about finding out more about my biological family and would always say things like ""aren't we enough"" ""they abandoned you and we raised you"". My adoptive dad also struggled with anger issues and would yell at me a lot so we have a strained relationship but he tries to stay close. My adoptive mom is always calling me and wanting to stay in my life as well. They are nice but can be angry and guilt trip me a lot into doing what they want.

Now when I was 18 I decided I wanted to find out more about my biological family and I searched for them using some documents I found plus the help of my aunt. I did find my biological dad which confused me as they said that he abandoned me and didn't want anything to do with me. I told my parents and they screamed at me and scared me so much and told me that my bio mom put whatever name she could think of on my birth certificate and that he did abandon me and that i was horrible for doing this behind their backs and that they should be enough. They made me promise to never reach out and that he wasn't my bio dad. 

I did what they said and didn't contact him as i believed them. Well, when i was 20 i decided to look him up again and found his Facebook and saw that he posted birthday posts on my birthday wishing his daughter a happy birthday and a few other posts about birth parents. This felt like enough information plus his pictures that it was him and I reached out. 

He was overjoyed and very excited and emotional to talk. After texting back and forth with him skirting questions about the adoption we decided to meet in person as he didnt live that far away. When we met up it was very emotional and we talked for houra. 

He eventually told me that he wasn't told he had a child and that he found out that he did after the adoption. He petitioned for a paternity test and it was positive but they didn't give him custody as i was 13 months old at this point. He was heart broken and tried to set up visitation but my adoptive parents denied him and that was that. 

I felt so betrayed and disgusted with my adoptive parents and feel like they kept me from my bio dad. I don't know how to move past this. 

I also found out who my bio mom is but she passed away a few years ago due to suicide. My bio dad said that she was forced into the adoption by her parents and that she would've loved to meet me. I've been so upset and heart broken ever since finding all this out.

I decided to confront my parents with this information and they at first denied it and told me he just wanted money (he never asked and all he wants is a relationship) but eventually my mom broke and said that they raised me first and that they wanted a baby for so long afetr dealing with infertility and that they didn't want to lose me. They also aren't supportive of the relationship with my bio dad.

I am unsure now how to move forward.

Ive met my bio dad's wife and their 2 kids 13m and 10m, who have embraced me into their family and are both lovely people. 

My adoptive parents are constantly calling and leaving either rude messages or guilting me and making me feel bad for doing this. I don't know what to do. I can't get over all these feelings of being taken and kidnapped and denied a relationship with my bio dad. 

My extended adoptive family have reached out to me to call me names and tell me what a horrible person i am as well."
ebj5gl,I don't know if I can still apologize to my daughter's boyfriend for my behavior towards him,13242,0.94,852,2019-12-17 00:10:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ebj5gl/i_dont_know_if_i_can_still_apologize_to_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ebj5gl/i_dont_know_if_i_can_still_apologize_to_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I'm in my late 50s and my daughter and her boyfriend are 25.

For a long time, I let ignorance and arrogance get the better of me. Those two things ultimately shaped my worldview and caused my to be prejudice. I was of the mentality that my daughter would always date white men. I got along with all her other boyfriends becausw we agreed politically and because they were white. Only to find out they treated her like absolute garbage.

Now, my daughter is with a Hispanic man. I wasn't happy about it at first, for reasons you can probably guess. Needless to say, I acted horrible towards this young man, but he was persistent on dating my daughter. In these last couple of years, I realized that my mentality was severely wrong and have actively worked towards changing it.

This man has treated my daughter with such kindness and has done the unthinkable for her. I've never seen her this happy and I'm ashamed it took me this long to see it.

I want to apologize to her boyfriend for my inexcusable behavior, but I'm afraid after all I've said to him, I have no right to ask for forgiveness.

Some advice would be very helpful, thank you."
b800pl,I [M28] Just broke up with my girlfriend over something she [F27] posted on Facebook. Justified? Did I overreact?,13167,0.91,2167,2019-04-01 15:06:52,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b800pl/i_m28_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_over/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b800pl/i_m28_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_over/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So we've been together about 7 months. We've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. But something I found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much I ended our relationship.

Some backstory for context: About 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. It started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. We both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

Fast forward to tonight. We're laying in bed and I realize I never accepted her Facebook friend request. I literally never use Facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. But we weren't doing anything else so I decided to accept the request and check out her Facebook (She was right next to me the whole time).

What I found really upset me. Multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. They were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

The first one I found was this: ""Hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... Like they are important to you..."" I think ""Hmm, is this about me?"" I feel like I make her feel important all the time. I drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. She had a birthday and I did all the things that you would expect: Multiple presents, dinner, I offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. I often buy her things just because. I offer her lunch nearly every day to show I'm thinking about her...

Ok, maybe I'm overreacting on that one I think. That post could be about anything or anyone, so I keep scrolling. I see another one: ""If you push me away, I promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... Hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. And I was a bit upset at seeing it. Especially considering I never felt like I was pushing her away. I spend literally every free moment I have with her. She got upset that I wanted some alone time. She says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why I need it, so I pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. We are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. I never felt like I was pushing her away. If anything, I felt like I spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

I keep scrolling, and I found the one that hurt me the most: ""Don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. What you won't do, someone else will.""

That one absolutely killed me. I never thought I was taking her for granted. And the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. On top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than I do...

I confronted her about these posts. She said they don't mean anything. That she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

I took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then I went back through our text messages to each other. Turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. That last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

It just felt so terrible. Like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? That's what it seems like to me. Am I out of my mind for thinking that? She made me feel like I was. She said I was overreacting. That she felt that way in the moment, but not now. But I can't stop myself from thinking ""If you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

Then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on Facebook. Anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. By sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""I'm having relationship problems!!!"". I can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (They were all posted within this past month). To an outsider, I must seem like a fucking asshole. Not treating her right. Not respecting her. Not making her feel important.

I just felt disgusted. I felt like I was going to vomit. I just kept seeing the words ""What you won't do, someone else will"". I know she didn't write them. But she thought them. She agreed with them. She broadcast them to the world.

I told her I knew myself well enough to know I wouldn't forget it. That anytime we had any minor argument, I would be thinking ""Guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than I do"". I don't think I could deal with it. Knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. Instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

I broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. It was ugly. I feel bad. I feel tired. I've had no sleep and I have to work in like 3 hours. I don't even know why I'm posting this. The relationship is over. Maybe I overreacted, maybe I was justified. I just know it felt right.

Edit: lots of people saying I jumped to conclusions. I do not feel I did. The conversation went like this:

Me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? There is a lot of them. (This was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

Her: why? Do you not like that I do that?

Me: I mean... It kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

Her: but those posts could mean anything. They could be about anyone.

Me: I just have a feeling that if I went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

Her: yeah, maybe some of them...

We left it at that for about 10 minutes, then I decided to actually check those times and dates. They all lined up, I went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. I stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

I then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. I may have jumped to a conclusion, but Imo it wasn't a very far leap. And she confirmed that I was right."
citoye,Fiancé has Dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn’t know he has them and women he’s said he’s never been with.,13137,0.93,1850,2019-07-28 14:31:10,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/citoye/fiancé_has_dropbox_folder_of_all_nudes_and_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/citoye/fiancé_has_dropbox_folder_of_all_nudes_and_of/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Me: 30F
Fiancé: 38M

We’ve been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. Throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. When I asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

This past week, I was playing a game we play together on his iPad when a questionable text came in. I went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. Being really angry and insecure about it I then went through his phone. We have access to each other’s phones to play each other’s dumb games when one of us isn’t felling well but I have always respected his privacy up until this point.

What I discovered was a Dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women’s initials. In each folder was pictures of nudes his ex’s and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while I was so black out drunk I couldn’t remember them being taken. 

Several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that I had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and I love you’s. 

After some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. He is an IT professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

I checked through time stamps and I don’t believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. I am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker’s privacy as well.  He insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. I feel like I’d be very disturbed if I were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

Regarding the original girl, he just didn’t want to tell me because he thought I’d be mad. I am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  After we hashed this out, I asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there’s anything else I should know and I wouldn’t get mad. He lied. Two days later I found this personal “porn” stash. 

I am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? Is this grounds for ending the engagement? The relationship as a whole? Part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time I just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn’t be restored. 

He claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which I’m sure I can believe but I don’t have any experience with this but I’m just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that I don’t know how to make a rational decision right now.

Edit: First I want to thank everyone reaching out. This relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but I was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. I can’t help but doubt myself even though I know in my heart that this just isn’t right. I’m shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. I feel like I can’t even turn to my own friends and family because I’m embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. I probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason I always felt like I was to blame. What’s going on is beyond not ok and I am now figuring out what my next steps will be. Thank you again for all of the support.

Edit #2: Regarding the “secret porn stash,” it wasn’t porn from the internet. I was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. I was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. I was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. It was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed."
evq7u7,UPDATE: How do I (24M) convince my sister (31F) that I don't want to fuck her fiance (~30M),13120,0.93,779,2020-01-29 23:14:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/evq7u7/update_how_do_i_24m_convince_my_sister_31f_that_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/evq7u7/update_how_do_i_24m_convince_my_sister_31f_that_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,,False,"PREVIOUS POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/euoyzn/how_do_i_24m_convince_my_sister_31f_that_i_dont/

 

The post got a lot more attention than I was expecting, so here’s what has happened in the last 2 days. I grew increasingly angry at my sister over what felt like accusations on her end during our conversation. I saw some comments about getting ahead of this, and talking to my parents ASAP, so that my sister couldn’t get to them first and spin the story. Originally, I wasn’t worried about this, but her behavior during our conversation was so erratic, that I couldn’t put it past her. I live only 20 minutes from my parents, so went to their house for dinner that night to have the talk.

I asked them to refrain from commenting / asking questions until I had said everything. I covered the basics. Rob and I had chatted, he stopped responding, so I talked to my sister. She blew up. I told them all the details: Rob was into me. Sister said they were gonna work things out. I was asked not to fuck him, and I got angry. I was very clear to my parents about why I was upset. That I was uninvited from the wedding. I know I’m not perfect, so I also told them what I said to my sister before she hung up, which I do regret.  When I finished what I had to say, my dad started laughing, which he is known to do when he’s uncomfortable. My mom was absolutely horrified. They both admitted that they had noticed he was ‘touchy-feely’ with me over Christmas.

We talked for a while about the questions they had. Had Rob said anything to me before the phone call? No. Had I known Rob was gay/bi/questioning? No. We had a whole discussion about WHY I wouldn’t make the promise to her, and to my surprise, they were completely on my side.

Now, here is where the shit hit the fan. As I mentioned in my last post, Rob had messaged me. He had said he was so sorry for causing all of this, for ruining my relationship with my sister, etc. He said that he was confused, but he does love my sister, and wants to move past this. I responded (much later that night, right before going to my parents) by saying that things may not recover from this, and he should have either broken up with my sister to figure himself out, or kept this to himself.

My parents were beyond upset to hear about this, and that I wouldn’t be going to the wedding. Even though I asked them not to, they called my sister immediately after I left their house. They wanted to know if she was OK, why she was so accusatory with me, and what was happening in regards to the wedding. Well, folks, it was a shitshow. According to my dad, she started freaking out, yelling, sobbing, and accusing them of taking my side. My dad tried to explain that there are no ‘sides’ here, they just wanted to remedy the situation. Their call lasted less than 5 minutes, with my sister going on a tirade about how this is her life and she won’t let us ruin it. She claimed she saw my response to Rob, and that we were all trying to break them up. She then uninvited my parents (WHO ARE PAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING) from the wedding and blocked them on everything. We are all worried that she’s having a legitimate mental breakdown. We have no way to contact her, and we have no family anywhere in Europe to help out. We have no idea how to help her.

At this point, we are quite sure the wedding won’t happen, as my parents certainly won’t pay for it after all of this. We are worried she may hurt herself, but we know Rob is a good-natured guy and will hopefully take care of her. I’m at a total loss. My sister and I were never close, but I never imagined her relationship with everyone in our family would completely implode within 72 hours. Honestly, looking for advice on where to go from here. Rob hasn’t blocked me on WhatsApp, but I am unsure if reaching out to him is a good idea. "
cg0d5l,[Update] I (19F) snooped on my brother (23M) and found something horrifying,13037,0.91,939,2019-07-21 21:14:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cg0d5l/update_i_19f_snooped_on_my_brother_23m_and_found/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cg0d5l/update_i_19f_snooped_on_my_brother_23m_and_found/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Link to previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cf6oib/i_snooped_on_my_brother_and_found_something/)

We just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. I know I said in the last post that I wasn't going to do anything about it, but I found that I couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

So I spoke to my brother.

We were alone, though our mother was in the house. It filled with lots of crying. He basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. I only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. I told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

He asked that I not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. Sounded fair, so I agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

In a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. Not sure how to better describe it. We most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and I hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. I'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones I ever had. 

Hopefully this is the only update I need, and thanks for listening :)"
cdufmj,Daughter's friend (F18) is making me (M45) uncomfortable,13028,0.96,983,2019-07-16 14:15:34,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdufmj/daughters_friend_f18_is_making_me_m45/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdufmj/daughters_friend_f18_is_making_me_m45/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I have known this girl for years. She always was a sweet girl and one of the things I always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. Her family life is stable as far as I know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200B;

But around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and I, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. When I'd overhear, I'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200B;

Then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. I acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? It stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when I try to tell her to stop.

&#x200B;

So, to avoid anything else, I cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. But the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if I don't pick her up. So I pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where I was having trouble driving, and every time I stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200B;

The first time I got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. The second time, she didn't and it was bad. I was telling the truth, and even I thought I was a sleaze. I told her mother that I was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, I'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200B;

I really don't know what is going on here. I am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like I am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. I have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200B;

I am sure that something else is going to happen, and I just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Edit: For the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

I have known this girl for 10 years. She was less than three feet tall when I first met her. She has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. She has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. She is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

I want her to find true happiness in her life and I want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. The last thing I want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. I am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**So for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200B;

**2nd Edit: A few questions answered**

1. My relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. She became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. She blamed me for her arrest and moved away. There has been no contact from her since she left. I have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. My friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. She has very little contact with her father. For example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. The mother is an immigrant from Greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. I gave her a ride because I have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. When I was that age, I did not call my parents when I was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger I was in. I am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. My daughter's friend is not the only one I have given rides to.
4. My daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. When she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that I have to stay away from her.
5. It really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. But at this stage I have to.
6. I don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions I do, I am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

f1bneb,I (58M) feel like I never really knew my wife (57f) after seeing the way she handled finding out about our daughters (25f) actions,13020,0.97,1455,2020-02-09 22:47:07,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f1bneb/i_58m_feel_like_i_never_really_knew_my_wife_57f/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f1bneb/i_58m_feel_like_i_never_really_knew_my_wife_57f/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I am aware the title is confusing and unclear, but the situation is complicated. I am overwhelmed and confused and I feel like everything I knew about the people closest to me was a lie. 

Long story short, my daughter Anna (25F) cheated on her boyfriend Adam (27M) who I have an amazing relationship with and is now pregnant. The child is not his. The other man doesn't know yet. Adam was on a business trip that lasted about 3 weeks. After he came back I assume Anna told him about the pregnancy because he called and said he wanted to propose and If I had any tips for him.

Three days later he comes to drop a wailing Anna off at our house with all of her belongings. Apparently, Anna's friend told him about the cheating. That is the only thing she told us through the crying Adam didn't say anything he just took her stuff out of the car and drove off. 

I was, and still am , deeply disgusted with my daughter. I did my best to raise her well and I can't believe she would do this. I am not able to offer Her any comfort or support because I just can't justify her actions. She is my daughter and I love her but I feel such deep disgust. What she did is despicable. I texted Adam, asking if he was okay. He said he'll be fine. 

As if these conflicting emotions regarding my daughter weren't enough, I have some about my wife and the way she is handling this.

My wife Mary as soon as she saw Anna crying started to yell at Adam asking what happened , cursing at him after he ignored her. Her reaction just added to my shock. I brought Anna inside while she was yelling and cursing. We comforted her, gave her water and sugar when she told us what happened through tears. My wife was shushing her , telling her it was going to be okay.  
But then she started saying things like ""you'll find someone better"" , ""he wasn't man enough anyway"" which disturbed me. She doesn't see anything wrong with what she said. I told Her that our daughter did something terrible and nearly got away with doing that to someone and that she shouldn't be validated . I'm not saying we should insult her, but we shouldn't validate her choices either. She disagrees and says she needs our support. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm disgusted by both of them , but at the same time they're my wife and daughter. This is the fourth day since it happened and Anna is posting on her Facebook things like ""Men are trash"" and badmouthing her friend  who told Adam. I dont really talk to her. Mary told me ""don't you dare talk to her about Adam"". I started spending more time out of the house. 
What do I do. I really need advice on how to handle this.

EDIT: I am now seeing posting on here was a mistake. Half of the people that commented have no business offering advice to anyone. I am deeply grateful and appreciative of all the helpful advice people offered, but now it has evolved into personal attacks and judgements of myself and some really hateful comments about women. To clarify, since a lot of you had trouble comprehending this : my goal is to support my daughter in a healthy way, without feeding into her misplaced victimhood like what my wife is doing.I do not think validating her attitude is going to do her any favours. In addition, I sought advice on how to get over this utter lack of morality, integrity and accountability both my daughter and wife have displayed in the last 5 days. I do not hate my daughter and I do not think saying ""this isn't about you"" is fair, since this impacted me directly, my view of the people closest to me and my relationships. Once again, thank you to all people that offered helpful advice and support."

We talked a bit and she turned out to LOVE dogs and I just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and I wanted a date.

Things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what I mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. I only really saw her dog when I was picking her up and I would never come in so I had no interaction with it.

Thing is she moved out to her own place last week. She now wants to hang out at her place. I would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

I am really, REALLY afraid of dogs. I know I should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. I mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? And then the more time passed the more embarassed I felt. Especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and I just... how can I tell her I'm one of those people? Except I'm afraid of ALL dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

How do I fix this? I don't want our relationship to end because I can't man up and just act like a normal person when I'm in a room with a friendly dog... I fucked up and I dont even know what to do here"

I’m not sure if anyone will read this but it makes me happy to write about.  I’m really glad I posted my original question even though it made me sound like a dick. The comments helped me realize that I was the problem and I needed to get over myself. Letting her slip away because of my judgmental ideas about people would have been a huge mistake. 

So I invited her over to my place last night and I awkwardly blurted out that I was falling in love with her and I see our relationship going somewhere. She laughed and and asked if I was asking her to go steady lol. She told me she felt the same way. Then we got a pizza and some beer and binge watched a show. And I woke up this morning with her snuggled against me.  It was perfect. 

I’m in love with this woman guys. I feel like my heart is going to explode. She’s the one.  I’m going to ask her to marry me one day.

So, we had the talk. My relationship is over. After some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late Saturday, I brought it up. She again tried to deflect and change the subject, but I demanded we stay on topic. I told her outright how I felt, how I thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. She tried to play it off like I was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. Then she spun it into a penis size issue. I kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her Ex-BF and NOT the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. I told her I wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and I was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

The conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say I have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. I knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so I outright told her the relationship was over.

Thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. They were helpful and confirmed my feelings. Now I guess I will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. I'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

EDIT: Thank you (again) for the overwhelming support. It would impossible to answer all of the messages I received.  I believe I made the right decision and will become a stronger person because of this. Your kindness and support is truly appreciated."

So, my curiosity got the better of me and I checked her phone while she went to the store. I looked through her text messages and saw an exchange with her friend on the phone. In the text messages, my SO talks about how she doesn't want to lose me, and how I have way too many options compared to her. She talks about how jealous she feels when other girls try and flirt with me. My SO and friend discussed trying to get her pregnant so I won't leave her.

I'm really not ready for kids at all, and it makes it really uncomfortable that my SO would want to trick me into getting her pregnant. When my SO came back she immediately tried to initiate sex, but I refused. 

It then blew up into an argument. She started talking about how I didn't love her and that I've been distant lately. In a fit of anger, I let it slip that I went through her phone and I knew she was trying to trap me. Things only went downhill from there and devolved into a shouting match. 

I left the house and packed up most of my things. I don't think to stay with her is worth my time anymore and she kept trying to gaslight and manipulate me. My phone is still blowing up from text messages, saying that she loves me and she wants me to take her back but I'm not buying it. 

Anyways, thank you to everyone who gave me advice."
a0br04,Just found out that my [25M] fiancee [25F] has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years [26F].,12819,0.91,3141,2018-11-26 01:28:40,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0br04/just_found_out_that_my_25m_fiancee_25f_has_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0br04/just_found_out_that_my_25m_fiancee_25f_has_been/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Hi all.

I've been together with Hollie for three years and I proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. She's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. We met on a night out. We moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. I thought Hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now I'm not so sure. 

I'm best friends with a girl called Sarah. We've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). I had a crush on Sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

When I introduced Hollie and Sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever I'm around they've always been civil to each other. However, Sarah has told me that Hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. I never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

However, Sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, Hollie is actively cruel to her. Making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. I did not believe this and actually distanced myself from Sarah to protect my relationship with Hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of Sarah when I told her what Sarah had accused her of. 

I've not been that close to Sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. Sarah was there and I brought Hollie along. For some reason Sarah left early and Hollie was really upset about something. She started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

Early in the morning when Hollie was asleep I got a whatsapp voice message from Sarah which was 20 minutes long. It was a conversation between Sarah and Hollie which must have been taken yesterday. It started off OK, but Hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. She accused Sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose Sarah over her. Hollie called Sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (Sarah is an elderly care assistant). She also told her that she'd make sure I'd want nothing to do with Sarah. At this point Sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. Hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. Sarah then said goodbye to her and Hollie can be heard shouting ''You f#cking b****!''

After listening to this I was not sure what to do so I pretneded everything was normal. I made Hollie breakfast like I always do. She's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

I'm not sure what to do. I thought Hollie was everything I'd ever wanted. She was perfect. But now I'm fairly sure that everything Sarah has accused her of is true. The things she said to Sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl I fell in love with. I haven't spoke to Sarah yet, because I'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

I'm not sure if I can continue my relationship with Hollie. Sarah was my whole world once, and even now I still care deeply for her. To know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. But at the same time I was so sure that Hollie was who I was meant to be with and I'm not sure I have it in me to break her heart. 

Should I break up with Hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to I go about building bridges with Sarah?

  **tl;dr**: My fiancee has been tormenting my female best friend for a while now and I've only just found out after not believing her about it, and am at a loss as to what to do.  "

My (24F) husband (31M) and I have three children, our sons look exactly like him (dark skin and dark eyes and hair) but our daughter doesn't, she looks exactly like my great grandparents (really pale, blonde and green eyed) but apparently he didn't think it was possible that our daughter could look like my great grandparents, and from the moment he saw her he told me he wanted a paternity test. At first I refused because I felt it was humiliating and because I didn't think it was necessary because I never cheated on him and I hoped he would trust me but he didn't and for the first two months of our daughter's life he made my life hell.

He didn't want to hold her even if she cried desperately while I was doing something else, he never woke up at night to help me with her, he never helped me with anything and that hurt me so much because with our boys he was completely different. He helped me all the time with absolutely everything and he was always there for me after giving birth, but this time he left me alone and it was the worst experience of my life. I have no family here and his entire family from the moment they saw my daughter turned their backs on me, I don't have any friends here either so it was just my daughter and me. She is a colicky baby so it was very difficult for me to do everything alone and on top of that help with our sons.

I decided to do the paternity test because one day his entire family came to our house to celebrate my son's birthday and no one spoke to me and they didn't want to include my daughter in the photos that my in laws took of all the grandchildren. So I knew it was stupid to keep waiting for them to come to their senses. 

Well, the paternity test came back positive and everyone was shocked and of course they felt guilty for not having believed in me. Everyone apologized and my husband even cried when he held our daughter in his arms for the first time and I know that his apologies were genuine and that's why I forgave him but I don't know if I can forgive his family. They treated me really badly and said horrible things about me just a few days after giving birth and I can't forget their insults or violence.

My husband knows that I don't want to see his family nor do I want them near any of our children and he told his family, so these last three months it has been just the five of us, but it doesn't feel as good as I expected. My husband is constantly apologizing and crying every time he holds our daughter and I am getting tired of this situation. I want us to be happy as we were before. So how can we move on? My husband suggested that we should start couples therapy, how much can therapy help?"

She got into a bad accident 3 months ago and is now in a wheelchair, presumably for the rest of her life. She's handling it like a champ. We've cried together a lot, but she's the most positive person I know. Always keeps her head up even after this. And I love her immensely, we are highschool sweethearts been together for 5 years. But everything that has happened has made me second guess our relationship. Recently I had a talk with someone and she mentioned how tough all this must be for me. Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair. There's so much in the world we wanted to discover and do together but we can't do it together anymore and it so so breaks my heart. I am really bad at putting my thoughts into words sorry, I just don't really know what to write. I love her to the moon and back. But then I think, what kind of boyfriend am I if breaking up with her even crosses my mind. We were planning to get engaged next year. She's always so happy to see me and knows I've had issues dealing with the accident. She's so selfless it's not even funny. Sex hasn't really been working and she herself suggested I get a FWB so I don't get frustrated. But I don't know if that will fix anything and quite frankly, I don't want anybody else but her.

Sorry for this mess and I'm not an English speaker. Any way this is sort of like a vent but I don't know what to do. I sincerely don't. I know I should talk to her but I don't even know what to say to her, or how."
bch7qp,[Update] I [34/m] found condom wrappers in our trash can. My wife [34/f] and I don't use them and I'm wondering how to approach this.,12669,0.95,1040,2019-04-13 00:14:13,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bch7qp/update_i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bch7qp/update_i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Link to previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

Opinion on whether I should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  Ultimately I decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  She wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that I could tell.  I know her pretty well and I think I can read her reactions to things well too.  And she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as I can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  I owe her the benefit of the doubt.  And finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and I'd figure out what was going on.

I brought it up pretty casually.  Just ""Hey, I found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  We discussed it pretty calmly.  She didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that I had thought of myself.  There was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  She understood why I was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

So that's pretty much the end of it I guess.  I don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and I'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  I'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all I can do.  Sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for."

First off, thanks for all your advice on this, it really meant a lot and helped me weighing my options and next actions!

So... Something big happened. Yesterday, we talked a lot about all kinds of stuff (only the two of us) and what was on our minds recently because of all the craziness going on in the world right now. During this conversation, he asked me if anything is up because I seemed to be a little bit down lately.

At first, I didn't want to say anything, but he looked so puzzled and geniuenly interested, so... I confessed that I developed a crush on him. He was baffled and told me he never would have guessed that. I went red in the face as I told him some details (How long this has been going on, how strong my crush is, etc.) He was really flustered and couldn't say anything at first. I also told him that I don't want anything to change to the worse and that's why I kept it a secret for so long, but that I just couldn't hold it in any longer.

He then told me that he's not into me, but that he really likes me as a person. He likes having me around and said that my personality is something rare in today's world. He doesn't want anything to change either and we agreed that our relationship as friends won't change. It is something that I have to deal with but he will support me in any way possible. I hope we can both stay true to these words.

Honestly, I feel relieved that this burden is finally off my chest and that he was so honest with me. It's better than him lying to me or something. I, of course, cried that night as I went to sleep because he rejected me, but he at least acknowledged my feelings which I'm so grateful for.

I think I can deal with this a lot better now. My feelings for him haven't changed, but I know where I stand with him and that he at least likes me as a very good friend. Friendzone can suck, but I have the feeling that we can get along better from this point on.

I know this is not an Update most of you hoped for, but it is not a negative one at least!

Thanks again for all your support and suggestions! ♥"

Sorry to have been a while with this, it's been a bit crazy here but here's the update. It's long but there's tl:dr; at the end. 


We left off while she was trying to apologize to me about the statement she made about saying all men were failed abortions. One of you commented something that really stuck out to me - that if she was apologizing *at* me it was a lot different than apologizing *to* me.


Luckily it seemed that she was trying to apologize *to* me. I had told her I needed some space so when I came back I kind of interrupted her apology and said I needed to say some stuff. I was pretty honest and brutal with her.


I said that it really hurt to hear what she had said. That it was really difficult to process someone who tries to promote equality in their life making what I felt was a hateful and unnecessary blanketed statement. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I felt as strongly as I did and I realized that it felt like she was not only grouping me in with a group she felt like should have been aborted, but that she was saying men were worthless, failures, and were better off not existing because they weren't women. Echoing what a few commenters quoted, I was simply an incomplete female to her. I was limited by my XY chromosomes. 



I said in the original post that I've had some questioning of my gender identity but I guess I didn't provide much background to it. It ended up that most of those sentiments are things I've thought to myself at one point. That I'd have been better off being born differently. That I'm worthless, a failure, that women are ""better"" than men out of femininity alone. 


I said all that to her, not as smoothly or without some discomfort, but I said it to her. Afterwards she cried a little bit and said she didn't know I felt that way and was sorry she said what she did. I pressed her a little bit to ask why she said it because... well, call me insecure but I'm not the kind of person to make statements like that out of anger and was always taught growing up that they're off limits. 


It turns out that when she was in her second year at college she was accosted by a police officer while walking home one evening. It ended with her being sexually assaulted. From talking with her about it, it seems all this stuff with the police has understanding been bringing up a lot of feelings for her. 


I wasnt really expecting that but I said if she needed to talk about anything I was there for her. I feel kind of selfish about it but I did say that I don't think I could deal very well if she made some similar statement again. I told her that I knew why she'd say those things, but if she needed to say them that she shouldn't do it with me. I feel like that was harsh and selfish but I told her I couldn't deal with generalized statements and I didn't feel like I could distance them from my own emotions. I apologized for that and said I'd be there for me if she needed it otherwise. 


At this point things just felt differently. I told her that I had decided I needed to talk to a therapist about my issues and try to figure out where I'm going with them. I floated the idea of her seeking out therapy too and she said she'd consider it. I think she will. 


I told her I loved her no matter what but that I felt like I needed a break to recenter myself and get more understanding of my identity. She agreed to it, and that's where we're at today. We are still friends and still talking, but have taken a departure on the more intimate discussions between ourselves. 


Thanks to most of the people who commented, there were a lot of good comments from both camps. Things ended up being in the middle of both sides. 



Tl:dr; We're on a break. I'm seeking therapy for my gender identity questioning. She's considering therapy herself and apologized for what she said. She had reasons for making the statement. We cried. I said I'd be supportive of her but set a boundary on future generalized statements."

He then placed the utensils and cutlery he used in the dishwasher.

We ate and he then went to dry and put away the things in the dishwasher. I got up and wanted to get some juice. As I walk passed him to go to the fridge I noticed 2 dildo’s on one of the racks.

Of course as a sane person, I lost it! Kevin was confused as to why I was upset because he has been doing this FOREVER. I have lived with Kevin for 2 years. Kevin thinks it hygienic and normal. He doesn’t seem to understand my outrage and shock. Like I have been sipping juice,eating of plates and cutlery with HIS AND HIS MILLION LOVERS BODILY FLUIDS! 

How do I convince/explain to a grown man that you don’t place your sex toys in the dishwasher?!

ETA: After my billionth time explaining why I am upset. Kevin says get this, “I always rinse it before putting it in the dishwasher”. This motherfucker wants to kill me! All this time I’m sitting here worried about Ms Corona Thee Viruses ass but it’s KEVINS JUICES THATs BEEN TRYING TO KILL ME!

ETA: Kevin has agreed to wash his sex toys in his bathroom sink from now on. I showed him how I cleanse mine. Tomorrow I will be following and watching,every move Kevin makes. CAUSE what else has this man been doing to me?!

Final ETA: I have gotten a lot of dms with the same questions. Kevin is a white man and I am a black woman. I have known him for 12 years lived together for a little over 2 years. Kevin is a bisexual man. I a heterosexual woman. This post has gotten back to Kevin and he and I have been very amused by it all.

I’ll start by saying that my wife and I don’t have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

We met on Tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. We’ve been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, I would say.

A month ago she left on a business trip for a week and I found myself downloading Tinder on a particularly lonely night. I don’t even know why. I didn’t have any intentions. But I did it.

I swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. It was a funny reminder of that time of my life. I deleted it and moved on.

On Monday my wife left for another business trip. Last night I once again downloaded Tinder and started swiping. Again, I had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

Then I saw her picture come up.

I say shocked for a moment. I wondered if I should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. I thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... But I read her profile... it’s her. It’s her now and it’s her live. There’s even a picture of her where I am cut out.

I decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

I swiped and we matched.

She gets back from her business trip tomorrow. I’m going to confront her then. I don’t even know how this is happening. She’s over 100 miles. Is a friend of her using her account??

Now I have to explain why I was on Tinder. This is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

What the hell do I do?

TL;DR - I matched with my current wife on Tinder"

A lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



On the day I made my last post, my husband and I had a talk that night when I got home from work. I basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. He repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



Then I moved onto finances. I asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". I pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. I asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. When I asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



I told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on March 1st. At this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. He wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as I talked. I doubt he even heard a word I said, but I clearly stated all the other issues I had -- the Instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



After this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. For almost a week now he's slept in the basement. He basically doesn't leave the basement when I'm home unless it's to get food. Honestly, it's pathetic.



I am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. I also have a coffee date planned for Sunday with my best friend -- I am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. Because honestly, this isn't the life I want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. I am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.

At first, our son looked exactly like us, but the older he gets the darker his skin gets (its medium brown right now). The problem here is that me and my husband are both pale.

So, a little background story, we live in Europe but neither me nor my husband are fully white. I am multiracial, my grandfather is Asian, and my grandmother is Indigenous Asian (imagine someone who looks like a Papuan, so basically, elsewhere she would be considered black). The other side of my family is white, hence my pale skin. My husband is fully Middle Eastern, but he and his whole extended family are very pale-skinned.

After our son started growing and his skin began to darken, at first I noticed people (strangers and even some relatives) giving me a lot of nasty looks when I would be out with him and my husband, but recently I have been getting verbally accused of cheating on him. A few of my ""friends"" (20s F) have said to me that they ""know"" my husband isn't my son's real father, and they've been asking me who the real father is. My husband has told me that his relatives and some of his friends have asked him if he is sure that it's his kid. Even my (white) mom (40sF) confronted me once when I was visiting her and said something along the lines of ""are you sure that you didn't cheat?"" (translated) and ""have you still been in contact with X?"" (X is my ex boyfriend from when I was a TEENAGER, no I haven't been in contact with him in years, and also she asked this only because X is black). 

I am honestly so hurt and in disbelief. I have never cheated on my husband and couldn't even imagine doing such a thing. I feel like our relatives and friends have stopped trusting me and have branded me as a cheater. My husband is supportive and always says that he knows that our son is his child (I mean, they even have the exact same facial features), but I'm scared that eventually even he will start doubting me.

I don't know what to do, I mean technically I could do a paternity test and show everyone the results, but I feel like that would just give off the implication that I slept with someone else since we had to do the test."
ajmn30,Not sure how to deal with my [37F] anti-vaxx husband [35M] since I want to get our kids vaccinated,12346,0.91,1692,2019-01-25 12:49:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ajmn30/not_sure_how_to_deal_with_my_37f_antivaxx_husband/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ajmn30/not_sure_how_to_deal_with_my_37f_antivaxx_husband/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"At first I assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  We were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

It's been 6 years. Six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

First, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

At 1 year I pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

Today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and I decided to take her to the ER.  

Thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

He said all the things I've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. He explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

I tried to explain that I agree, but I feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes I was respecting up until now.

He ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

On the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

I look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

I won't do this anymore. Although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

Can I just take them myself?  We always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

What can I say so he won't go? How can I keep this form him, or should I tell him once it's done?

Reddit I need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

Please help

Edit: for the people who are down voting::

If I was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. Help me help my children this is no different. For those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. I thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse."

c5rn6a,I am 25 and getting married. Dealing with issue around picking my “Maid of Honor” for my wedding. Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice.,12290,0.94,1686,2019-06-26 21:35:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"  

I am planning my wedding to my awesome fiancé and am so excited. We’ve been planning the event and will be married later in the year. He has his Best Man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. I thought I did, too. We each have 6 people and I have 5 female bridesmaids and a “man of honor” which I want to be my brother. My bridesmaids think this isn’t a great idea and a few are hurt I’m not choosing them instead. Here’s why I want to choose my brother. 

My biological mother lost custody of me when I was 4 and I was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. I lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother’s case. From 4 1/2ish to 6 I lived with my mother and it was bad. She was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 I was being adopted out. By some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and I went to live with them and was later adopted. The family had boys – the youngest was 16 when I got there. I was terrified of him when I got there, which they told me about recently (I have no recollection of that). I do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. He skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. I had eating problems, I had dental problems, I had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. He came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (I hadn’t started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). He and my mom would do learning activities with me and by September I was okay to enter first grade. I used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he’d reward me with Riesens. We were very close, he didn’t go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. He’d pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 I had an older brother to rely on. He eventually moved out and went to medical school (he’s such a great person for that field). 

Very literally my brother helped save my life. I was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. He was a calm stable influence in my life. I credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – I would never have gone to college, I probably wouldn’t have graduated high school or even lived as I was so sick. I had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before I was 8. My family doesn’t look like me (I’m most likely Mexican and something else, most probably African-American) and doesn’t come from where I do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. Since the others were older and out of the home I was never as close to them as I was my parents and brother. 

My thinking is, a Maid of Honor is someone really important and I cannot think of anyone else who comes close. I haven’t even asked him yet but I think he’d do it. I told my parents and they said they wouldn’t say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. My husband is also good with it and think it’s a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified I suggested it and think it’s “creepy”. If I look back on that time, it’s the happiest a person could be. Is it weird and creepy? Does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? Is it highly inappropriate?"

I have lost some friends who said that I was just looking  for an easy out and so on. In the moment I feel actually pretty devastated because I still love him. I feel like everyone hates me.

bnrv9w,My sister caused a scene at Mother’s Day brunch because we didn’t honor her as a “cat mom”,12216,0.86,1222,2019-05-12 23:26:01,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnrv9w/my_sister_caused_a_scene_at_mothers_day_brunch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bnrv9w/my_sister_caused_a_scene_at_mothers_day_brunch/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Hi guys. I am a man, 32M and I have two sisters - Carly (38F) and Melinda (26F). We went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

Melinda and I are happily married, each with three children. My older sister Carly never married. She had a fiancé that she cheated on and he left her. That was 10 years ago and she hasn’t been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. She has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

My mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and I both gave her an additional grandchild. So she gave a speech.

In her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked Melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

Upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister Carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked “Achem!”

She then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don’t we ever wish her a happy Mother’s Day?

I explained calmly that she isn’t a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant “I am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! Just because I don’t have human babies doesn’t mean I’m not a f*cling mother too!”

My younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, Carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf I know right) and then stormed out.

We thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. Despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

We have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. I don’t know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

I tried texting Carly to say “hi”, but my text came back green (which she has an iPhone so it’s usually blue). Does this mean she blocked me?

Anyways I would appreciate any help y’all could give here :/"

I walk in and they are awake, lying down and my stepson is just like playing with him. I can’t bring myself to describe in detail. My son was giggling but as soon as he saw me, my step son burst into tears.

He got up and ran into my arms. He kept saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” I told him it’s okay. I didn’t know what else to say, I was speechless. He kept pleading with me “please don’t tell daddy”. 

He was so distraught so I didn’t have him go to school. All day he’s been in his room alone crying. My son is fine, he’s been watching cartoons and playing with his toys all morning.

I don’t want to tell my husband on the phone, I want to wait till he comes home. But I don’t know what to say to him. I’m so worried, I don’t think he’ll take it well. How do I tell him? What can I do? I know it sounds crazy, but I’m not angry at my step son I’m just sad and confused. I want both my son and him to be okay."
cgcwwy,I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,12112,0.93,1698,2019-07-22 18:31:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than_my_new/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than_my_new/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. This may just be a problem I'm identifying in my head, and I know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

I'm an anesthesiologist in Washington, D.C. and make over 300k a year. Consequently, I live a comfortable life and, while I have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. I'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because I'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

My gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. She's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

We've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. I love spending time with her.

The issue is, I think she's uncomfortable with how much money I make. Whenever I take her on a date, I insist on paying for everything. This makes perfect sense to me, because money I spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. But she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. She'll insist on splitting the bill, or if I pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. I've told her time and time again that I'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so I'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. But she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

One time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. It was nonrefundable and she was out $300. When she was complaining to me about it, I immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, But she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

It's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, I just think it's silly that she spends money on me when I make more in a year what she'll make in five. And like I said, I'm happy to treat her.

Any thoughts on how to navigate this? I especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr I make a lot more money that GF, but she won't let me pay for things."

TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. 

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer.


I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.

On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.

I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?

My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?

I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.

They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard ""hello?"" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a Mother"" and hung up.

Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.

I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.

What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:

1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose.  Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........

Edit: 3 - My GF and I are still going to therapy about all of this."

**DISCLAIMER: To avoid confusion I am going to name the girl who is pregnant ¨Layla¨, that is not her real name for obvious reasons but I am going to address her as Layla so it is less confusing for people to read. Thanks!**

I apologize for writing this days later. I have had a lot on my plate for the last few days and it has been beyond stressful. Thank you to everybody who gave me genuine advice .

I waited for my son to come home from a friend's house. At this point it was almost time for dinner and was New Year's Eve so I had ordered Chinese food for us and brought out board games. I figured to start the conversation out slow and work my way towards the topic. I knew he wouldn't open up to me if I approached him with anger. We sat on the living room floor for awhile watching tv and eating and laughing. I then brought up that if something was going on he needed to tell me. He insisted nothing was going on and became defensive. I asked him if he was sure and became even more upset.

I stopped giving him the chance to tell me himself. I placed down my phone with the messages Layla had sent showing me the pregnancy test and pictures that my son and her had taken together. His face went completely blank and he had nothing to say at first.We sat there in silence for a good minute or so while he was in complete shock that I knew. He started freaking out and telling me that it wasn't what it looked like and he was beyond stressed from the situation. I  remained calm as possible while he started to tell me little excuses. I gave him a chance to tell me how this even happened and what he was planning to do about it without telling me .

He told me that him and Layla had met during spring break through his girlfriend.His girlfriend had brought Layla to one of their dates at the mall.She then added him on Instagram soon after and they had small talk until around May. She often would send him flirty texts and would insist on hanging out. He claimed him and his girlfriend have had a rocky relationship for a couple of weeks and that she was very sneaky and often talked to her ex and other guys that had liked her. He told me this had caused a major mistrust between them and they slowly started to fall apart. One day in June,all 3 of them had planned to go to his house for awhile and then go hang at the park nearby (there is a huge park area a block away and a lot of teens hang there, my son included) . His girlfriend ended up cancelling last minute and it was just him and Layla.

They talked for awhile and he claimed one thing had led to another and they hooked up once. (I  also usually work on weekdays and apparently this is when all the hooking up took place).She often lied to her parents about her whereabouts and they started to hook up frequently. He told me that she said she was on birth control and kept telling him that protection was not needed (we now know she was never on birth control).She then told him one day that she was experiencing horrible morning sickness and tenderness in her breasts,odd cravings for food,and terrible mood swings. My son told her that it was just a period and she was over exaggerating but she secretly had purchased pregnancy tests and took 3 altogether that came out positive. He didn't believe her so she had bought more expensive pregnancy tests (Clear blue brand) and took them at his house. They both came out positive. He was very freaked out by the situation and didn't know where to go from that point. He asked her what happened to her being on birth control and she gave him the excuse that it isn´t always effective. He still feels like she purposely became pregnant to trap him and make them stay together.

He said he has been wanting to tell me but hasn't since Layla refused to tell her parents. He said she wore very baggy clothes around her parents to hide her stomach and wouldn't  bring anything up about the pregnancy. She often stayed in her room and became quiet at school.He knew she needed to get an ultrasound and needed to figure out the plans for the baby. He pushed for an abortion when she was earlier in her pregnancy but she denied it every time and wanted nothing but to raise the baby. He lied to her and told her he would leave his girlfriend to help her raise the baby and so they can be together but she still refused to tell her parents. He was very scared for her and knew she wasn't in the right mind to raise a child.

He then went on to say her parents were highly strict but loving understanding people. He said that they would not kick her out but would most likely not let her keep the baby and let them raise it together. Supposedly , she had lied to me and exaggerated the situation because she knew her parents would not let her keep the baby once they knew. The next morning , I called Layla again and asked her if her mom could stop by one day in the morning to talk about the pregnancy. I promised her nothing would happen to her and i would try my best to make sure the best decision comes out. She eventually gave in after my son convinced her and soon enough I had her mother's number. I texted her during the evening and asked her if her and her husband could stop by because a situation had occurred between my son and her. She said she couldn't make the next day but would come on January 3rd. Around 11:30 A.M, Layla and her mother stopped by (her father did not come for some reason).

Of course her mother was completely devastated by the news and couldn't hold her feelings in. They started to argue back and forth for awhile and eventually they both calmed down until Layla had started crying.She was heartbroken by this and kept calling her crazy for thinking she could perfectly raise a child as a freshman in high school. She even called her out on sleeping with a person that has a girlfriend that she was friends with. She was furious and I could understand but I knew anger wouldn't help the situation any better.Finally after what seemed liked hours and hours of trying to come to an agreement, we both agreed on adoption the most (we are not 100% sure yet but this is what we feel is best ) . She is way past the point of abortion and wouldn't get get one to begin with.All  of us talked her into giving the baby to a more financially stable family that could give the best care to it. It was hard getting her to agree but obviously there was no way she could raise the baby like this. Her mindset was completely wrong and she was just scared and way too young to comprehend the reality of a child. I did explore the ideas of a DNA test but we're still planning out that. She said he was her first ever and that he was 100% the father. My son had agreed on this but at this point.. who knows right?

She finally went for her FIRST ultrasound today and she is pregnant with a girl. She is actually 21 weeks pregnant and is definitely showing.The doctor was very concerned since she has not been to the doctors through her pregnancy until today but thankfully the baby seems fine.She is thinking about doing online school temporarily because of people bullying her once they find out.They have both agreed to not tell anybody about them being the parents for the sake of people judging them and causing stress to her. He did break things off with his girlfriend and admitted he had cheated on her with a person and that it's best for them to go separate ways. I bought Layla prenatal  vitamins and maternity clothing. Her father found out and was beyond enraged but is trying to help his daughter through this.

Her mother said she will keep my son and I updated and have another meeting to finalize the decision but it definitely seems like she is going for adoption since nobody agrees that they should raise the baby together. My son and her are not allowed to see each other as well anymore or speak to each other unless it is about the child. I guess thats where we are at now. We have awhile to go from here and a lot to decide on since adoption is a whole other process to go through but I feel like I can finally breathe somewhat now. Thanks to everyone again for the advice!"
15pjpj3,My 23F bf 24M didn’t want to pay 200$ to save my life,11996,0.96,2781,2023-08-13 05:29:00,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15pjpj3/my_23f_bf_24m_didnt_want_to_pay_200_to_save_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15pjpj3/my_23f_bf_24m_didnt_want_to_pay_200_to_save_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"I was at a bar with my bf and his friends a while ago. We all had a great time, dancing on tables, singing and drinking. I remember feeling totally fine one second, and the next I got VEEERY unsteady, and I lost connection with my body. I got confused and scared, but then just SO CALM. It was all types of weird. This is seconds here and there I remember, most things that happened doesn’t exist in my memory. 

I became unconscious, and according to my bf, the few times I opened my eyes they looked very scared. He was told to get a taxi and get me to the emergency room fast. He managed to get me into the taxi and it started to drive. My boyfriend told me that during the drive the driver told him that he would have to pay 200$ extra if I threw up. Thren my bf said fuck no, stopped the driver and wanted to WALK to the emergency room. I was still unconscious, and he didn’t know why, or if my life was at risk. 

Luckily for him, the police was driving around and saw me laying on the ground. They asked him what’s up, and drove us to the emergency room with blue lights on and fast. 
They took it very seriously and without them my bf would have been lucky to even get me to the emergency room. Turns out I got drugged that night. 

It got worse, as he forced me to walk with shaky legs from the emergency room the day after. A walk that should have been 20min took me 2hours. Even started talking about the fact that he could have gotten drugged too, and that maybe he got a little dugged??? Even though he didn’t feel weird at all that night??? 

THEN he started to talk about him paying the taxi 40$ for the little drive and how much that was! Like he wanted me to pay him back or something?? He constantly stated that it was 40$ and how sick that was. (It’s the normal price around here.)

He looked up symptoms related to being drugged, and found that long term symptoms would mostly be trauma. The next weekend I had to be with his friends again and some people I didn’t know. They talked about that night and even made joked a little around me being drugged. (Not a lot but I felt awful.)

He also ignored me once when I said someone was following me. He was never scared of letting me walk around in town at night, but if a female friend did it, then he would have to follow her. He argues when I’m scared instead of making me feel better or protecting me. Other than that he’s a kind man that doesn’t want to hurt people but like..
This can NOT be normal??? Is this a relationship worth it? I’m scared I’m overreacting but keep in mind that most of this is told from his perspective, as I don’t remember that night.

EDIT: I forgot to say that I asked him what he would have done differently if this happened today, and paying the taxi was not on the list.

EDIT 2: I said it in the comments, but it’s difficult to even see it at this point. I just have to say that he did call for an ambulance, but they didn’t come. According to him it was one of the first things he did. But he told them I was conscious and so they didn’t feel the need to come. An ambulance is basically free here, meaning it would have saved him some money. He would have no reason not to call.
 
Some people also said that I should have payed him back for the taxi, and I agree based on the information I gave you. But I was the one that payed for drinks that night, and I spent A LOT more than 40$ on him, in total I spent 176$ to be exact.

Edit 3: I also want to say thank you for all the feedback! It feels both awful and good having my feeling validated. In a way I wanted you guys to tell me that I was overreacting and that he really tried his best. Seeing that you also find this situation a little fucked up makes me feel less crazy though haha. And yeah.. I’ll dump him. I think it will be the best for the both of us."

My mom who made my appointment requested a male doctor since she isn’t supportive of me liking girls and doesn’t want me being touched down there by one. I begged her to get me a female doctor as I was uncomfortable with a guy touching me. She told me that if I told the guy to stop and switch to a female to examine me I’d be in big trouble.

During the exam the female nurse that was in the room was trying to comfort me since I was crying uncontrollably since the male doctor touching me and it gave me flashbacks of something that happened a few years ago. A few minutes after the exam started I told them that I needed a female doctor since I didn’t feel safe with my current doctor.

He was very understanding and a female doctor ended up finishing my exam. My mom was yelling at me for the entire car ride home and took most of my stuff away(writing this on my junk tablet that she didn’t find). She is very mad at me what should I do"
ctspb2,Is it weird that my gf (22f) “tucks me in” to bed every night?

Our schedules are quite opposite, I wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. I always go to sleep first, I need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and I always have to be up early in the morning. She slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes I’m already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time I’m just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

I’m not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that I get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. I love it, I think it’s adorable and I’m kind of a clingy girlfriend so I enjoy it a lot! I’m just wondering if anyone else does this?

Recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and I went to bed early and left them to their Netflix, and my girlfriend said she’d come tuck me in soon. I got embarrassed about it, like it’s weird or something? I just don’t want people to find it strange or gross, I don’t know.

Is it weird?"
ejgbu9,"How can I(30f) convince my acquaintances(who thinks that they are my friends) that I am not an innocent, manipulated, gaslit victim? I am just an Indian woman living my life happily in a western country.",11969,0.85,572,2020-01-03 20:17:11,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejgbu9/how_can_i30f_convince_my_acquaintanceswho_thinks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejgbu9/how_can_i30f_convince_my_acquaintanceswho_thinks/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"* I have never been with anyone but my husband. We had an arranged marriage and I am perfectly happy with it.

From a young age, I had high hopes about my man. I wanted a well educated, physically and mentally sound teetotaler with a good job and nice family. And yes, he should love and respect me. If I had met anyone like that, I might have fallen in love. I didn't want to spend my time and efforts on clueless teenagers or jobless young men. I didn't want to play trial and error with my life and I am happy that I didn't have to, at least till now.

We found the person of our dreams through arranged marriage and there aren't any compatibility issues since our families did thorough background and character enquires before marriage. 

*These friends of mine thinks that I missed out so much 'fun'. I don't regret spending my time on some worthless men*

* They hate that my MIL lives with us for half of the year

I use the term MIL so that the readers will understand things clearly. I use the same term to address both my mother and mother in law(Amma). I think my husband's mother is my mother as well(keep your stupid incest jokes to yourself). She too thinks that both her daughters in law are her own daughters, except that we entered her life quite late. She had always wanted to have a daughter and when her son's got married, she was really thrilled. She is more like my best friend or partner in crime than an authority figure.

She divides her time between her two sons and both of us are happy to have her with us. She is a very friendly and kind woman. When she is with us, she helps us with the household tasks and looks after our 18m daughter. When I am too tired, she manages everything alone. I feel guilty but she tells that she could pursue a career only because her mil looked after her children and it is her duty to support her daughters in law.

Also, we often have 'girls' nights'. I am a bit of an extrovert but my husband likes spending time alone at home. On some days, I, my daughter and mil go out, and enjoy while husband chills at home. 

*My friends think that she is taking away what should have been dates between me and my husband. None of us thinks so*.

* Our daughter is quite fond of her. I don't feel jealous that she likes her grandmother, sometimes even more than me. Grandma is more fun, knows many stories, plays with her often and spends more time with her.

Also, we make our daughter sleep on our bed, between me and my husband, like most Indian kids do. Though my friends tried to scare me with SIDS statistics, I didn't budge. Most if not >90% children in Asia and Africa sleep like this and end up as perfectly normal adults. When mil is here, she takes the baby to her room sometimes so that we can get some 'private time' easily (an unspoken arrangement,of course) . 

I don't think she is stealing the affection of my daughter or that I need to establish some 'boundaries'. Even I used to like my grandparents more than my parents when I was young. That doesn't mean that I 'unloved' or disrespected my parents. I don't think that I need to be the centre of my daughter's existence. 

* Once, when my friends asked my husband whose cooking he likes the best, he replied that he likes his mother's cooking. Even I like her cooking which is far, far better than mine. I don't feel insulted or belittled. But they were like 'He shouldn't have disrespected you like that'. Wtf?

Basically they think that I and my husband should be a team, 'we' and everyone should be some outsiders, they. But I consider my family (immediate and extended) 'we'. It is not as if we are some petty nuclear family teams fighting against each other. We are a big family and everyone likes and respects each other. 

Most of them have toxic mothers or mils. These intolerable insecure women also think that everyone except their husbands and children are some monsters who are out there to steal their 'family' from them. All my family has always been good to me. And my family includes my in-laws too. It is not a bubble. 

Tl; Dr: How can I convince my acquaintances that I have a perfectly good family life? Or, how can I tell them to fuck off without coming off as too offensive?

Updates

**Why do you encourage bedsharing and cosleeping?**

They are so normalised in my culture that there aren't even seperate terms like these.  We just call it sleeping. Also, when I had the baby I was not sleep deprived(had family to help 24x7). I have never had any drugs, cigarettes or alcohol in my whole life. It was a perfectly normal thing for me. 

**Why do I hang out with these women if I have a happy life?** and different variations of it

I am used to being friends with my neighbors. In India, we were like family, almost. I knew every Tom, Dick and Harry in my neighborhood. My father was friends(including his bf) with the people who used to commute with him in the train. 

Also, I am used to being a part of different social groups. I don't have to drop one to join other.

**How do these acquaintances know so much about me?**

It is my fault. Since I am not used to having too much privacy(as I said earlier, I knew a great deal of things about my neighbours and vice versa), I didn't care.

**Why did I call them 'intolerable insecure women'?**

They are intolerable. They have told me that they are insecure. And they are women.

**If I had an arranged marriage, could I go without changing my name?**

Yes. My grandmother, mother and mother in law have kept their maiden names. So did most of the working women I know. In my family, my grandmother's mil was upset, but things changed. We are from a fairly progressive area in Kerala, so we are able to live according to our convictions. 


**Am I materialistic? Why don't I like 'jobless' young men'?**

I am materialistic because I am not interested in suffering. While I am aware that we often end up suffering due to unforeseen consequences of our actions, i didn't want to make choices which are very likely to cause suffering, especially since better alternative are  available.

**Why don't I like dating?**

I don't have anything against the people who date. My parents had a love marriage. But finding someone in the first or second try itself is very rare and as I said, I am not interested in wasting my time. Does it sound condescending? Perhaps it does, I can't help it. Much needed explanation from u/Gunner3210 which explains the context.

> But you have to understand the cultural, social and economic contexts here. Young adults in India are generally very far from being independent as they reach adulthood.

> It's culturally the norm that kids continue living at home till their mid 20s/early 30s, until they are married off. The current generation of parents of these adults, typically in their 50s and 60s, are highly successful economically, typically holding well-paying, stable jobs that easily allows them to support their unwed children.

> As a result, the young adults growing up these days predominantly fall into two categories. The first one, they realize that they need to be independent, and start focusing on getting an education, a job and start developing their careers, even though they don't need to for the moment. It's entirely socially acceptable for adults to be supported by their parents.

> *These kids, they emerge out of their 20s with a solid job. Generally, work hours in India are not as regulated as in the west. An average job would involving working 10-12 hours 6 days a week, leaving little time for dating. Typically, these adults, once they find themselves established, go for the arranged marriages that OP has found herself in. They get married, and move out, and things are solid since the fundamental aspects of supporting a household are all taken care of.*

> The second category, they don't focus on anything in particular. There is no need to become independent, so they don't. These generally focus on dating instead of finding work. The general track record for these types is that they date a bunch of people, and then find that the basic mechanics of starting your own household are not in place. They are not financially independent. *So whatever time was spent in dating doesn't lead to a future that is actually viable. So it then becomes a waste of time, for someone like OP is specifically looking for a stable future with marriage and starting a family etc. Which is why she mentions a waste of time.*


**Who takes care of my parents?**

My brothers. They visit me occasionally.

**Won't grandma get bored?**

She is a trained classical dancer and singer. She pursues her interests when she gets time. And sometimes, we get free live entertainment."

My gf who I've known for basically forever (been official since I was 14) is having my baby. Everyone especially my parents keep telling me I fucked up big and my life is over. They say I'm a loser and I'll never get anywhere in life. They say I'll never be happy again. How true is that?

I keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

I'm pretty much freaking out at this point. I have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. Obviously I don't want to be a dad BUT Im gonna be. So it is what it is. 

My parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. Since I told them she was pregnant they said since I'm making adult decisions I now have adult responsibilities. They make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. I have to buy my own food and anything I need. I have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting I'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. I have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

I desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money I had none. I was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. Gfs parents bought me a new pair since I got an infected toenail from being squished. I don't want to owe them too, JC.

Anyway. I'm leaving home once school is done in June. Gf's parents said I won't have to pay them rent as long as I help with the baby and contribute with that.

My parents say they'll sue me for the money I owe them. Can they? When I get mad they just say I'm an adult and I get adult consequences now.

So ya. This got a bit derailed. Am I doomed?"

I (22m) am her only son. My parents are divorced, and I had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that I was living in Asia teaching English. I promised my mother that I would visit her when I returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before I came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. My mother told me I should visit my father first because of this.

I should also add, that at this time and the past few years, I was very, VERY depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. I really wanted to be at my home where I felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. When I got home, my grandfather passed away on the day I arrived, and I was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so I stayed with my father for a few weeks.

Later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. I debated visiting her at that time, but I wasn't sure I would be feeling well enough to travel again. My grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but I told her I would have to think about if I can come then. Eventually I decided that I would visit them at the same time as my mother.

The night I arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. That night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. I was driving home from the airport at that time. I remember that night so vividly as I could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  My aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. I noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. They seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

After about a week I returned to my father's home and stayed there. I was an emotional mess for the following month. I had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. Eventually I began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" I was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. They accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. They even insulted my father. Relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but I have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. I know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. Especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

Today I received an email from my aunt that told me that I would have to go to court. It simply stated that I should call this lawyer. I am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. It's so difficult for me to think clearly, and I can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. Any advice would be appreciated. I feel like I missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify, that I don't know the actual legal accusation. She accused me of those horrible things while on the phone.

Edit 2:  One comment mentioned it, but I just want to say that I don't believe they are after money. They genuinely believe I am a horrible person, and a horrible son, so they wish to hurt me.

Edit 3: Thank you for all the responses! I have read all of them, and they gave me a lot of confidence to keep moving forward. I did take the advice to post on r/legaladvice. So I'll update everyone (hopefully soon) to how this situation unfolds. Thanks again!"

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

She saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. I really want to thank her for it, but I'm kind of afraid to tell her because I don't want to upset her. I want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. How much I love her for it.

We all really like our stepdad though, he's great! 

My stepdad has a son, Andy, who is 9. They are moving in this weekend. Andy mom passed away when he was a baby, so Andy also stays with his dad full time. That means he'll be here at the house full time. (I hope I explained that background clearly :s ) Anyway, I like Andy, he's a cool dude. 

Anyway, I'm looking for any advice on this transition, mostly with Andy. I realize Andy is going from being an only child, to having three stepbros living with him, and that's a lot to take in. In addition to a new house, new neighbors, new room, and a stepmom. Also is there anything I should know about now being a older stepbrother to Andy? I've always been the youngest (and my brothers always joke that you can tell), but I want to be a good brother to Andy. 

Andy's quieter than me and my brothers, plus the fact that we're bigger and he's going to be in new surroundings, im worried that if he doesn't like something he won't speak up about it.

I guess my question really is, i have a new brother moving in, how do i foster the best relationship possible with him? 

any advice is welcome!

My family has been having dinner together one night a week since the pandemic started, usually at my parents’ house. This week, I thought my brother and his family would sit it out, and it would be just be me and my parents. But my SIL showed up, without my brother or niece. She said she absolutely did not want to discuss what happened, so we didn’t. But I can’t imagine how pissed she must be at my brother, to openly go against him so she could attend a dinner with her in-laws. So that’s good.

Since dinner went well and we all had a good time, I decided to send my brother a text this morning to try to make amends.

The text I sent:

>Hey bud. We missed you and \[niece\] at dinner last night. I was hoping you’d come by so we could talk about what happened with \[niece\] and \[dog\]. I understand why you’re upset and I’m really sorry that \[niece\] was scared. You know how much I love \[niece\] and I’d never want anything bad to happen to her. I absolutely won’t put \[dog\] down though. He’s not dangerous, it’s just that he can’t talk so he growled to communicate that he wanted \[niece\] to leave him alone. He’s a family member to me, I can’t put him down. Especially when he didn’t do anything wrong. But there’s lots of other solutions we can work out to keep \[niece\] safe. I’m totally fine if no one in your family ever wants to see \[dog\] again. Or if you want, we can talk with \[dog trainer friend\] to try to figure something out that keeps everyone safe. You know I think you’re a great dad and doing an awesome job with \[niece\], but I really think she would benefit from understanding how to treat animals. The next dog she meets might not be as relaxed as mine, and she could really get hurt. We can work on teaching her together. Do you want to meet for dinner next week? I can come to you and we can get takeout from \[restaurant\]. I miss you.

The text I got back:

>Once again, you and everyone else choose a dog over my human child. It doesn’t matter what \[niece\] did, she is a HUMAN and deserves to be safe. You’re really saying “well she started it” about your DOG almost attacking my CHILD?You can’t keep a dog that would attack a kid for being a kid. And I can’t believe you’re talking about the next time \[niece\] meets a dog. What about the next time YOUR DOG meets a kid? The next parent won’t be so understanding, \[OP\], they’ll call animal control and demand he be put down on the spot. No we can’t meet for dinner like nothing happened.

And my response:

>Sorry you feel that way. Please let me know when you’re ready to talk about it. I’ll be here.

I know a lot of you think my brother is a dick, and just hearing about this one incident, I would too. But I really think every single one of us would come off as a dick if someone wrote a reddit post, asking for advice about the biggest asshole thing we’ve ever done. Everyone has their good and bad qualities, everyone is sometimes a chore to be around, and I love my brother. I don’t want to fight with him and I’m disappointed he’s determined to drag this out. I know a lot of you wanted me to just ignore him until he stopped acting like a jackass, or cut him out altogether, but that’s just not realistic for me and our relationship, and it’s not something I want. I do think my SIL is eventually just going to make him talk to me, so hopefully this won’t drag on for too much longer, but I’m just really sad about the whole thing. I’ve done all I can do, though.

My SIL and I have plans to go hiking this weekend.

tl;dr SIL and I are fine, brother still being a jackass"

I am in tears writing this and know what I have to do but hoping someone thinks I should stay. 

In March my daughter was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. To say this has destroyed my wife's and my world would be an understatement. We also have an 11yo son who is not biologically mine but I am his only dad.

We were both at the hospital and there was an alarm that her blood sugar was dropping (type 1 diabetic) I picked up her phone and there was a conversation with a man asking for another pic. I let it go but it was eating me up 

A couple hours later when my wife was sleeping he messages again. This time I respond he said he's sorry it got weird but he thought that him and my wife were ""exposed."" I wake her up and have a huge fight at the hospital. 

The next day we are discharged. About 5 minutes we get a call from the radiologist, there is blood in my daughters brain. Since I drive and my wife doesn't, and we need someone to stay with our son, I go up to the hospital at 11pm. We are watching Curious George on the tablet when a Facebook message pops up. It's him responding to my wife's message of ""My husband isn't home. Come over."" She claims she is an addict and just buying pills. We have had this problem before where I told her I hate she takes these meds but as long as you don't lie I will help you. Well all she is doing is lying. I have caught her in over 20 significant lies. 

I'm scared if I leave I will lose my 11 yr old son."
1cqqp4l,"My twin sister (18F) and I (18F) took a genetic test, and we did not share any DNA. What should my next step be, when no one in the family is telling me why?",11777,0.98,2123,2024-05-13 09:55:58,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cqqp4l/my_twin_sister_18f_and_i_18f_took_a_genetic_test/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cqqp4l/my_twin_sister_18f_and_i_18f_took_a_genetic_test/,self.relationship_advice,0,20,,text,False,,False,"My twin and I are fraternal twins. Recently, we took a genetic test for fun, because we wanted to see what we shared and the differences between us. Since we still share genes, fraternal twins are like siblings genetically. My grandparents had suggested the tests and got them for us, so our parents didn’t know about it. But our results made no sense. My twin’s was coming up almost completely as Eastern European and Western European. Which makes sense, as most of my family are Croatian, German, or Austrian. So all of that would be accurate. But mine wasn’t anything like that. It was almost completely Scandinavian, with some Russian and a couple of other places. Neither of which were on my twin’s result, she had a very small percentage of Scandinavian but that was it. And we had no matched DNA. Which clearly seemed impossible. We were literally twins, we have to share DNA. 

My twin said they must have mixed my sample up with someone else. We ended up contacting the company, and my twin and I took a test again. It was the same result. Both my twin and I were really confused. We told our grandparents, and they just said that was interesting, and said nothing else. My twin said we should tell our parents, and see if they had ever done a genetic test, or if any of our siblings had, and then we could see if somehow ours were still right. I mean, it kind of made sense I'd have Scandinavian, because I'm much taller than my mother, and quite a bit taller than my twin and I'm way better at football and handball than she is. And I'm very blonde compared to the rest of my family, but I had thought it was the German.  When we told our mother, they reacted almost the same way as my grandparents, but she seemed annoyed. And said that they're inaccurate anyway, and our grandparents shouldn't have told us to take one. And when we asked our father, he basically said nothing.

I'm confused. I know my twin thinks it's just a mistake, but I don't think so. We have to share DNA, about 50%. That's how twins and siblings work. Even though we're fraternal, we should still share quite a bit of DNA. But other explanations don't make sense. My mother can't have cheated on my father, because my twin and I would still share DNA. Just less, because we would have different fathers. The results mean we can't share a parent, or even be related. But I don't see why my parents would adopt me if I'm not their child, when I don't think they've ever been to Scandinavia and why they'd adopt a baby that's almost exactly the same age as their baby. I'm panicking. The person I'm closest with in the whole world, who I thought I even shared the womb with, might not even be related to me. My birthday might not even be real. None of this makes any sense, and no one is telling me the truth. I'm also scared my twin might tell her boyfriend about it, and then people might end up knowing that I'm some kind of fraud and my family isn't my family at all.

Edit: I called the clinic where my mother gave birth to all of my siblings. The day of my birthday, my mother is in the records but only for one birth. Not two, not twins. I don't know if it's an error, or my mother didn't give birth to me. "

Hopefully I'll see some of you there.

I posted a few days back anticipating my new sister moving in. Tonight(12am ish here) was her first night here and I feel like the advice I got here greatly helped me through it.

I took the advice of some of you and I made sure we gave her a while to just sit and adjust in her room. I was kinda expecting it to take a bit longer but I was also happy to be wrong. I got the fun of showing her around and she actually tried to start a conversation while I discussed some details which was good. She didn't really talk to my parents much though.

I found out some better info on her sight, she can see most colors and make out larger shapes so that's a lot better than I was expecting. I asked a few basic questions to get some idea of what she does/doesn't like, and the first thing I've found out about her, from her is she doesn't like seafood. There's a start.

She seemed pretty nice but jittery, but I guess I've got to expect that. She didn't eat anything and slept early but I'm guessing it was probably nerves and the like.

I don't really have a lot to talk about because it was one night but I just felt like I should let people know how things went after they helped me with it all. I'd be happy to write an update like a month in or something but I'll see how that goes. I'm looking forward to actually living with the change but as awkward or whatever as it was, tonight was a very good start in my eyes.

Thanks a lot for the help.

hrx74p,I (26 M) recently found out that my Fiance (28 F) has hid her massive debt from me for our entire relationship.

I've been with my fiance for a little over 3 years now. We met through friends and started dating soon after. I proposed at the beginning of the year and we were planning to try to get married this summer. Due to a certain world wide event we had to put that off though. Outside of the normal relationship troubled that most people have, our relationship has been great. I really felt like she was the one and I loved her. But, it turns out she's been lying to me about her financial situation. 

My fiance has never been in a ""good"" situation financially. She never went to college and works as a server full time. This never was a problem for me. I went to trade school and make enough money to support both of us if needed, I have had to give her money before to help her when we were dating and this never bothered me. We ended up moving in together specifically to help her out in this area. This was never a problem for me as I really don't care about money. However, this week I found out that she's been lying to me about how bad her financial situation actually was. When we moved in together my fiance claimed she only had about 6k worth of credit card dept. I gave her the money to pay that off when we moved in together so that it wouldn't be a problem in the future. Well, it turns out this was a lie. This week I found out that she has MUCH more debt. Over 110K!. She did not tell me this. I found this out when A debt collector called me. It turns out when she moved in with me she didn't inform any of her creditors that she moved,

Even though I don't care about the money, this pissed me off to no end. I confronted her yesterday about this. She claims that she was so afraid she was going to lose me at the start of the relationship she decided to just not tell me about her massive debt and was going to wait till after we were married. For 3 years she just decided to lie to me. I called of the marriage then and there and packed a back and left for my parents house. She's called me nearly 60 times since then and I've ignored ever one. 

When I told my parents about this they said I am being immature and petty. According to them this is ""not a big deal"" because ""everyone has debt now a days"" and if I love her I need to understand how scared she was to tell me. I do love her, but she lied to me for 3 years about this. Along with this, the fact that she is so far in debt will become my problem if we married. Everyone i've talked to say I need to look past this and go back home. But I honestly am thinking of just calling her and telling her I'm done and we're over.

I feel like I need some advice here."

[Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/baec65/i_59m_cut_two_of_my_kids_24f28m_out_of_my_will/)

So I took the advice of the previous thread, which was overwhelmingly to consider setting up a trust for my two problem children.

Before I even invited the two of them over to talk the issue over, my son called me to apologise for how he was acting. He seemed genuinely ashamed of the things he said and admitted that it was wrong of him to waste his mother's savings like that.

Anyway, I invited the two of them over to tell them my plans. As I say, my son seemed very apologetic, while my daughter was clearly still upset with me.

I told them that I would reinstate their inheritance, but since they've demonstrated extremely poor money management that I will only do so through a trust. That I'd talk with a proper lawyer/financial expert on setting them up, and they'd be designed to provide for them and any future children they have over many years after I'm gone. That them blowing through it in a few years is simply not an option.

Son took the news very well and said he wouldn't trust himself with that money anyway. I'm not sure what caused such a sudden change of heart in my son, but as I say it **seemed** genuine. He also offered to go to therapy for his sex/drug addiction if I helped pay, to which I agreed (I'll make sure this therapist actually exists, don't worry). 

My daughter did not take it well, Christ. Far worse than I expected. Here I am willing to give them a second chance, and she just blows up about how it's not fair that it's only them that don't get the money outright. I explained that their siblings had demonstrated they were responsible with money and hence why I would leave it to them outright. Nope, not good enough for her. She doubled down that spending all of her mother's 300K+ GBP on travel was justified. Had the gall to again call me several extremely upsetting names and accuse me of being emotionally abusive.

So I told my daughter that as I'm retiring soon, perhaps I should experience the joys of travel also. Perhaps I should spend ""her"" inheritance that I've worked for my entire life on travel myself. She stormed out and hasn't contacted me since.

Really proud of how my son's taken the news. Extremely disappointed in my daughter.

Genuinely considering spending ""her"" part of the inheritance on travel myself at this point."
14ge64t,I (38F) am in a new relationship (51M) and his texts are starting to concern me.,11666,0.9,3358,2023-06-23 02:02:58,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14ge64t/i_38f_am_in_a_new_relationship_51m_and_his_texts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14ge64t/i_38f_am_in_a_new_relationship_51m_and_his_texts/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"My current boyfriend and I have been together since February and we've had a few arguments but generally things are good. What I can't wrap my head around our some of the text messages that he sends me. They come out of nowhere and feel a little nuts to me. I don't know if I'm the one being a jerk here but I don't know what to make of them. I've told him it puts me off but he doesn't seem to hear me.

 This is an example of one he sent today after he video called at lunch. I answered but he hung up and wouldn't answer when I called back. I left a message saying I guess he didn't have service and couldn't answer but just call back if it's important. 

His reply was ""What would b the point in answering after seeing u are dressed make up on and hair done? That tells me u have been up for hours and in that time I guarantee that ur phone has been in ur hand a lot and never once did u have the desire or want to call or text and say hello good morning I love u or even fuck off for that matter. And that makes me feel like shit to b real honest. So I didn't answer. "" 

5 minutes later I got this ""And because you still have nothing to say, that just tells me I was right""

This kind of thing is getting more frequent. I feel like it's kind of excessive but he says it feels like I don't love him. I don't even know how to respond honestly.

Update: I packed a bag, my laptop, gun, important paperwork, etc. Most of my stuff is in storage because we were supposed to move at the end of the month. I didn't want to leave him there but his texts got really ugly when I told him it was over. I feel a lot safer at my friend's house out of town. The barrage of texts have gone from nasty to desperate to accusing me of lying and never caring about him to him taking photos of gifts he supposedly bought me to threatening to hurt himself and me. Apparently I'm "" not giving a shit about it but here I sit trying to fucking talk to you and work this fucking thing out because I care more about you than I do the lies. I love u D. Why can't that b enough for u"". 

I'm SO done with this bullshit. It's probably going to be hard trying to get him out of my life but I'm saving the texts and going to (at least try) get a protective order tomorrow. Thank you all for your comments; they reaffirmed that this behavior is unacceptable. I think I kept adjusting to a ""new normal"" every time he would do something that was off but not quite bad enough to break up over. We had endless talks about his behavior and he was very good at reassuring me he'd work on it and then being the best boyfriend imaginable. It's like he's two different people but I'm positive the nice side is an absolute lie now after some of the stuff he said. I'm safe for now and definitely won't be going home without an escort.

To answer the questions about why he moved in so quickly: We've been good friends for 5 years and he never once acted like this. I thought I knew him pretty well so that's why I gave him the benefit of the doubt for so long and let him move in. When he proposed it was so romantic and he was so convincing I got a little swept up in the idea that it was real."

Thank you for all the advice and apologies for the vagueness of my original post. I showed it to my girlfriend and she agreed that it was vague and thought I left out important details. I will let her provide those details at the end.

You convinced me that it may actually matter who throw the first punch. Before making the original post, I had heard two mutually exclusive versions of events. One told by my girlfriend and one told by my parents and my brother. It's honestly very hard for me to believe that any of them would lie about something like this.

I have since reached out to everyone else who may have seen how it started and received two relevant replies. One from my aunt who confirmed my parents' and brother's version and one from my youngest sister (18f) who described a scenario similar to what my girlfriend had told me. Everyone who sided with my brother has obviously had the opportunity to talk with him and each other and intentionally or unintentionally influence each other's story. It's very unlikely that my girlfriend and sister has done that as they don't know each other and my sister would have no reason to lie for my girlfriend. I don't think there is a reasonable explanation for them telling the same story other then that it's the truth. I'm therefore almost certain that my brother hit my girlfriend first.

My parents have recanted the threat to cut ties with me for not braking up with my girlfriend but they are still saying that she is not welcome back to their home and ""will never be part of our family"". I'm honestly done with them at this point. She has done everything and more including being willing to pay for his medical expenses and my brother refuse to even hear her apology much less make his own or take any responsibility at all. At this point, I'm 100% behind my girlfriend just as my parents are 100% behind my brother.

Many people commenting on the original post asked if my brother is racist or assumed that he is after I revealed what the argument was about. I'm honestly not sure how to answer that. My brother sometimes repeats racist talking points from TV and social media especially against Hispanic people but last year he was strongly against the deportation of a neighboring family who had immigrated from Mexico. He even (probably facetiously) suggested that their deportation was a conspiracy to undermine Trump's immigration policy by deporting ""good people instead of violent criminals"". I have never heard my brother use a racial slur or seen him treat anyone differently because of their race. I guess the answer depends on how you define racism.

**TL;DR**: My brother probably throw the first punch and my family won't cut ties with me completely but I'm mostly done with them.

My girlfriend's comment:

> This is what I think happened based on what I remember, assume, and was told afterwards. It's probably not entirely correct.
>
> We where all sitting around a big outdoor table. I was sitting between my boyfriend and his brother. We talked about non-political things like places we had been or wanted to travel to but then someone mentioned the protests and my boyfriend's brother immediately responded by calling the protesters terrorists. I asked what made them terrorists and if the cops where also terrorists by that definition. I don't remember how he responded but the argument continued from there. We where drinking progressively more alcohol as we continued to argue, almost like if we were in an unspoken drinking contest. At some point we both stood up and continued to argue loudly while getting in each other’s face.

> My boyfriend tried to separate us by pulling us away from each other and by attempting to stand between us but we ignored him and continued. My boyfriend really doesn't like conflict or people screaming and he was probably very frustrated at that time so he left and went into the house. We where both angry and I definitely wanted to punch him but I still had enough self control to restrain myself. I fully believe in freedom of speech and I know that violence is never an acceptable response to someone expressing an opinion. Then he punched me with a closed fist in the face. I don't remember feeling afraid or like I was defending myself when I hit back. What I felt was a strange mix of hatred and excitement. We traded a few punches and then one of mine caused him to fall to the ground. I imminently kicked him in the chest and was then pulled away from him by his dad.

> That kick is what I regret the most. It was excessive, dangerous, and completely unnecessary. I kicked someone laying defenselessly on the ground and I didn't feel anything for him until several hours later. I'm terrified of the person I was then but that person is still me. I did that but I can't understand why. I was not afraid and I remember doing it deliberately. I keep thinking about what would have happened if no one was around to stop me after that kick. Would I have kicked him again? How many times? I can't answer those questions and that's the most terrifying thing.

> My boyfriend wrote that we both had substantial injuries. I don't think that's true. I had a black eye and some bruises. My boyfriend's brother had a broken rib and a concussion. My injuries were not substantial compared to his which is why I don't think it's unfair for me to pay for his medical bills. I would have done that even without the threat of reporting me to the police.
>
> Some comments on the post indicated that my boyfriend's brother should either be more to blame or should feel ashamed of losing because of his gender. I disagree. Gender should not have anything to do with this. It's possible that he feels differently and is ashamed of losing to a woman but I don't think he should feel that way even within that value system as it was essentially random. He could just as well have knocked me to the ground with his first punch. I don't think strength or skills played any significant role."

I made a post here a few days ago talking about my parents discriminatory attitude towards my gf because she's blind. Firstly I'd like to say thank you for all the people that took the time to comment on my post and help me out.

Today(it's evening now) she wanted to come over again, and I had told her about the post so I decided to talk to them first. I sat down with my parents and discussed some specific issues and basically pushed them to actually name some ways they thought her disability would inconvenience me and answered them for them. After that I asked them to please stop treating her the way they are and that it wasn't fair of them and enough is enough. I mentioned that she was coming to stay for the night and that if they talked to her, I wanted it to be respectful and inviting.

They took it okay, and my dad definitely took it better than I thought, mom not so much. Afterwards, I spoke to dad privately and just asked him to keep an eye on my gf whenever they're in the same area and watch how she does things by herself and is independent and he said okay.

Tonight has been okay so far, they haven't really had any conversation this evening but there wasn't anything rude or condescending/belittling and I'm wondering how long this will last. I hope my dad actually pays attention and maybe points out some of the independent things to my mom but idk.

My gf was pretty pleased when I told her about the post and said it was really sweet that I wanted to go and seek advice for how to help make them treat her better so I got good gf points. I figured people might appreciate this update and I thought I would ask for strategies to use so I can keep this initial little bit of progress going and make it an actual change."

It's long.

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ijgc4i/my_parents_falsely_accused_my_brother_of_being_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I've been asked to update the situation. Many of you guys asked that I let brother live with me, but I had to take him back to our parents house this morning.

The last update I gave was when my brother was aloud to spend the week at my house. That was last Sunday. We spend the first day (Monday) at my house just talking. He spend most of the time in the room. At first he wasn't responding back. It was going no where quickly. So I ended the conversation by telling him our parents were wrong and that he is not weird. I didn't say it exactly like this but I hope you get the point. He just had a stone face and we stopped talking.

Tuesday he still didn't really come out of the room. I offered to go to McDonald's and he came out the room to eat at the table. We just talked about random different things. He wasn't really interested in the conversation until we started talking about my Xbox. We eventually started talking  about Madden. He started talking about how good he is at the game. We finished eating run he went back to his room.

Wednesdays I bought Madden. I don't play sports game. I play games like cuphead or cartoon animated games. I asked if he wanted to play and he agreed. I know this is serious but Madden absolutely sucks. The game started cheating as soon as we started. The first thing my player did was fumble the ball. He was killing me at it. He actually laughed a couple of times, and he seemed to be enjoying himself. We spent a good portion of the day just playing.

Thursday was pretty much the same as Wednesdays but he was talking more. I was gonna go to the movies but Covid is still a thing. We eventually just settled to watching Netflix. He spend half the day in his room but he is coming out more.

Friday I decided to try to talk to him about the situation again. I pretty much told him I would talk to our parents to get them to understand why he was hurt by it. I also took the advice of seeing if He wanted to talk to a professional. He asked me not to ask them about it. He said it was just better if nobody brought it up again. I was a little shocked, but there's not much i could do. We then decided to go to a walking trail. At first he didn't want to go but i convinced him to come. We just spent more time talking. This also made me realize that I should talk to my siblings more often. He seemed happier.

Saturday or yesterday was pretty much us just talking again. We decide instead of Madden to just play random games I had. I don't have a lot, but I think he had a good time. When it was dinner time he got kinda quiet again. I asked him what was wrong. He said he wasn't ready to go back home yet. I didn't know what to say. I asked him if he wanted me to talk to our parents to see what we could do. He just said no again. I pretty much told him he could come to my house anytime he wanted to.

That leads us to today. He is back at his house. I was gonna talk to our parents, but I assumed he has a reason for not wanting me to talk to them. I know you guys said something about getting him a therapist, but he said no to the idea.  I did call my sister to see how she's doing. She said she tried to apologize to brother but he ignored her. I don't know what happening with that, but one thing at a time. And that's pretty much how the week went. Over all he seemed much happier than he was last week. I texted him and he wants to come back over some time next week.

**THIS PART HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BROTHER,BUT ITS ABOUT ME.**  you don't have to read it.

Im gonna be honest with you guys. I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. Im only 23 still trying to get my life together. I'm a firefighter so im just glad that we get a lot of vacation time or else I would've had to work. I know people are thinking if your a firefighter you should know what to do and why did you ask what the signs of depression are. I was never trainer on how to deal with somebody actively showing signs of depression. I was trained to help somebody who is in the process of trying to commit suicide,and that training wasn't that good. It was basically try to talk them down and do whatever you can to get them to a hospital. I've yet to use this this training. This is why I was panicking when everything was happening. People were telling me he could commit Suicide. I know I should've kept a cool head but it just felt different because it was family. They tell you not to panic but I'm only human. I've been a firefighter for about 2 years now. Anyway something else I wanted to say.

Im gonna try to be there for both my brother and sister but I made a mistakes to. Somebody brought up the point of when I found out what happened what was my reaction. Im ashamed to admit it but I didn't have one. I thought he was gonna get over it and everything would be alright. I only started caring when I realised that he wasn't acting like his normal self. That when I realised the impact of what they said and how fucked up this all really is. So to the person who brought up this point. Thank you. This showed me that no matter how great my actions are looking infront of random strangers the truth is that I had a similar mindset as my parents. I don't think he's weird, but I guess my time spend around them made me desensitised to the things they say. Idk

I'm gonna work to change that because it's not right. So to everybody thank you for the advice you've given. I see the mistake I've made and I'm 100% behind changing myself and being behind my brother. 

Tl;dr: spend time with my brother. He seemed much happier, and he is now back at his house. I also realized I fucked up by not reacting much when i first found out what happened. Im gonna work on myself while also spending more with my siblings."
gxudx8,I (28M) found out that my gf (25F) once had a threesome with her sister (22F) and it creeps me out,11458,0.89,2398,2020-06-06 22:16:26,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gxudx8/i_28m_found_out_that_my_gf_25f_once_had_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gxudx8/i_28m_found_out_that_my_gf_25f_once_had_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I have been dating a girl I'll call Jess for just over a year now. From the beginning I thought she was a great girl and we really clicked, so generally things have been going great between us. But as the title suggests I got a huge curveball recently.

A couple of weeks ago Jess and I were hanging out with her sister, who I'll call Anne who was visiting from out of town. I've hung out with Anne before and she also seems like a great girl who is actually very similar to her sister. Well we were drinking quite a bit that night and at one point Anne brought up a sexual encounter she recently had. While I'm not a prude, I didn't really feel comfortable talking about sex with my gf's sister so I gently tried to tell them to take the conversation back to PG territory.

At that point Anne kinda laughed and said it's not like talking about sex is a big deal between them given all they've been through. I thought she just meant that they were sisters, but Jess had a weird look on her face, so I asked her what she meant. After some prodding they basically admitted that three years ago when Jess was still in college she brought home a guy one time when Anne was visiting her and they basically had an unplanned drunk threesome. My reaction was just wtf. Both Jess and Anne seem like normal, maybe even slightly conservative girls, so the idea that they would do this was just batshit to me. I asked them if they regretted it, but basically they said that even though it was a mistake, they didn't necessarily feel bad about it. 

The booze was hitting us pretty badly at that point and we called it a night soon after that. We didn't mention it again until Anne left a day later, but then I had another conversation with Jess. I told her that what her sister told me made me very uncomfortable. Her response was to get defensive and say it's not like she can change anything so what's the point of dwelling on it. She said she obviously wouldn't do something like that ever again.

The problem is somehow the situation really bothers me. I know it sounds like a fantasy to some people, but I find it quite the opposite. I don't really know how to explain it, I suppose they did nothing wrong per se, but the idea very much weirds me out. It's even weird to think about being around Anne again knowing that they have this kind of history.

I am not really sure exactly what advice I am looking for, but I just want an outside perspective. Should I try to have another conversation with Jess? Am I making a bigger deal out of this than I should? To be honest I even found myself considering breaking up over this situation since part of me is afraid I'll never be able to look at Jess the same after this.

tl;dr: I found out that my gf and her sister had a threesome once before we met. The situation creeps me me out and is making me reconsider the relationship."
f3kpyk,My (33F) 650lb sister (33F) has one foot in the grave and NOTHING will make her stop.,11454,0.95,1419,2020-02-14 07:07:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f3kpyk/my_33f_650lb_sister_33f_has_one_foot_in_the_grave/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f3kpyk/my_33f_650lb_sister_33f_has_one_foot_in_the_grave/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Last month my sister had a heart attack. This was after a small stroke she had the year before too. She managed to call 911 in time, and was taken to the hospital, so her life was saved but these TWO life-threatening events has changed absolutely nothing.

She still refuses to move, she spends most of the day/night in bed almost completely immobile at this point. I try to get her to just take a few steps in her room and she refuses. Me, my brother (30M), and our parents (60s M/F) have done literally everything we can think of. She won't walk, won't entertain the idea of talking to a therapist, doesn't read any of the information I send her about healthy diets, never sees a doctor except when she's been in imminent danger of death, eats nothing but utter garbage fast food and junk snacks, and basically has sat on her ass for years collecting unemployment doing absolutely fuckall besides eating nonstop, sleeping, and surfing the internet. 

The only people in her life besides us are the older couple (50s M/F) who live across the street from her. They're who she calls now whenever she wants food (It used to be me as I live in the same area but a couple years ago I stopped after the realization I was essentially helping her kill herself. Also back then she could still get to the door to get delivery from drivers, now she can't). 

My parents also used to live nearby but my dad now has early onset dementia and they've moved to be closer to the resources and care facility he needs, my mom even went back to work to try to fund some of this. So neither of them is in a position to do much practically speaking, especially with getting older and their own health problems. My brother is married with a kid and they live a few hours away. It's really just me and her neighbors. 

I have tried so hard to get the neighbors to understand they NEED to stop enabling her. It's difficult because I think my sister has become like a surrogate daughter to them, they lost their own daughter unexpectedly when she was 28. They have keys to the house. I'm glad there's someone there in case my sister needs help but a lot of what they do is the opposite of helping.

For example, I've tried to say I really appreciate them wanting to take care of her, but for her HEALTH, could they cook some healthy meals to share with her instead of always ordering whatever greasy fried takeout she wants? I've offered to give them some money for groceries. They accepted, but ended up just using it to buy more of the fast food and sweets. When I confronted them the wife said my sister starts having a panic attack if either of them tries to say no to her. The wife described one time when she had to rush over because my sister was crying saying she couldn't breathe, and was ""going to take a knife and just end it all"". Nothing would calm her down except a certain food item. So she called her husband while he was at work who then picked it up for her.

I don't know what to do. I can't control these people or always be there to monitor what my sister is doing! I got engaged this summer and this is starting to wear on my fiancee, understandably. She's afraid I'm ruining my own mental health by stressing about my sister. It's not entirely wrong. I just don't know what else to do. She is my twin and we've always been close, until she started living like this... just throwing all care for herself out the window and letting herself pile on hundreds of pounds, I don't understand it. She won't explain. Never has she given a single reason why she continues to keep doing this. 

Her body is probably destroyed beyond recovery at this point and it's just a matter of time until it gives out completely. She's recently started needing the neighbors' help to sit up and position a bucket so she can pee off the edge of her bed. She constantly has sores and cracks from her skin being stretched to breaking, also she can't wash by herself either because she's gotten too big to reach all areas of her body. 

My brother and his family come to visit every couple months but it's a lot for them with a baby. My parents visit when they can, but my dad doesn't always remember who we are and my mom seems to have reached a point where she's so devastated over seeing my sister like this that she kind of emotionally shuts down. 

Both me and my mom went to the ER after she had her heart attack. Her weight was found to be at 658 pounds. While she was in recovery we got to hear the doctor say to her face that she didn't ""almost die,"" she ""IS dying"" and will be dead by the end of the year if she keeps going like she has been.

We just don't know what to do. She WILL NOT even TALK about her weight. Let alone try to eat less/better (she ate completely normally until her mid 20s maybe, this has not been a lifelong issue in the making). She's never attempted a single thing to lose any weight. She thinks everything is fine! According to her, her stroke and heart attack (plus leg pain, joint problems, sleep apnea etc) aren't because of her obesity. She doesn't consider herself obese either for what it's worth. We are watching her die in slow motion before our eyes and I'm desperate for any strategy to make her care that we somehow haven't thought of yet.

Has anyone ever been through this with a loved one? How did you deal with it, and did it work? I feel completely helpless and alone so even someone being able to relate would mean a lot. What can my family do to save her life?

TL;DR: My sister is severely obese, near-bedridden, won't stop eating and gaining weight, and her health is rapidly deteriorating. Nothing anyone says (family, doctors) has had any affect on her."

I think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. I think she thought the same. However, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while I was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

Apparently ""Fernando and Sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! When he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what I'm getting from it.

So I told her flatly that I don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. Case closed I thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

I'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear I'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! She keeps going on and on about her work friend Fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

SO at this point I'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? She's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but I'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" It's concerning.

Straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""Fernando's Sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... I'm like... lost for words right now. How do I make it clear I don't want to ahve sex with someone else and I believe in monogamous relationships.

We have 2 kids."
aijhzx,[UPDATE] 1 year later- I [28F] gave my boyfriend [28M] an engagement ultimatum and I might be regretting it,11370,0.93,1989,2019-01-22 10:43:23,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijhzx/update_1_year_later_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aijhzx/update_1_year_later_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but I had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (I've known that I want to marry him for about 2 years, so I've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). I was getting frustrated, (I would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so I told him in September that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or I was going to move out.

&#x200B;

Update #1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: Written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. His asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in December 2018 if I visited his family in their home in September and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. His reasoning was that I had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (I had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). I was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200B;

Now, on to the current update:

***March 2018***: I couldn't go through with the ultimatum. I was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. But when push came to shove, I couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. I decided that I loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that I had created. I also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in December. I felt I was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because I wouldn't wait another few months. As a compromise, he said we could get a cat (I had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. On 3/31, the day I was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200B;

***April-September 2018***: My boyfriend and I spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. We both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. I got a therapist and started working on myself. I picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. I think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. Also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. I'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. By the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. He also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200B;

***September 2018- visiting his family***: As I promised him, I went to visit his parents in their home in September. As I mentioned in the previous post, he is Chinese-American (and I'm white), so I studied up on my basic Chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. It was a great trip, and I genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. I left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). I asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in December would be ""too fast."" That seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. He also told me I needed to learn Chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect English but prefer Chinese when they are with family), so I started doing Rosetta Stone.

&#x200B;

***October-December 2018***: Around November, I started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. He was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. For instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by December because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). Another time, he freaked out that I have student loans (most people in my profession do, and I have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. Luckily I already have this spreadsheet, which I showed him, and he calmed down.

In the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. Although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because I was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. I worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. I also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- I stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as I had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). We spent Christmas together for the first time this year, and I really thought he would propose then. But he didn't, and I didn't bring it up or pout about it. He visited his family for New Years and I was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200B;

***January 2019:*** I accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. I was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and I tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. I was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. It's now to the point that I equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that I shouldn't have. I realize I've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. But a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. First, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if I stay onboard long term. However, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (I am actually okay with it for the most part). He also has given a hard NO to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). I started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

Then, this weekend I went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. Also, I want to have kids, that's the main reason I am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). So yesterday, I was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and I had this ""Aha!"" moment where I realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. There's no shame in having my own wants. And at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (No marriage, we can't stay in the city where I have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but I've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with HIS desires. So I'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. Also I am willing to hear all the ""I told you so'"" from everyone who said I needed to leave this guy in March when I said I would. I totally deserve it. Thanks for reading!

&#x200B;

***UPDATE***: Wow, thank you Reddit for the super thoughtful replies! I read each one (so far)! 

I spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. I started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. He brought up the fact that it’s moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. That we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that I want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes I make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. He worries about  the fact that I get a lot of Amazon packages and he doesn't know what I am buying (showed him my Amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). Also this is all on my credit card (which I comfortably pay off each month) so I don't think I need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. He also doesn't like that I'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). Also, since it came up a lot in the comments, I wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we’re an interracial couple. 

However, after all this, he said he’s not ready for marriage. I was pretty pissed and told him I wished he told me this a year ago so I could have moved on. He basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. So I told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. He's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but I'm remaining gently firm here."
1eenoqy,My (34M) wife (31F) is having a meltdown over our daughter's personality and I don't know what to do.

Update link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/1ekyfjo/update\_my\_34m\_wife\_31f\_is\_having\_a\_meltdown\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ekyfjo/update_my_34m_wife_31f_is_having_a_meltdown_over/)

I'm a 34 year old guy, and I have a 16 year old stepdaughter. My wife is 31.

In highschool, my wife was a ""popular girl"" stereotype. Pink, blonde chunky highlights in her brown hair, this was the mid-late 2000s. She was on the cheerleading team, had lots of friends and boyfriends, was well known and liked. She was basically the living embodiment of the picture perfect girl from those cheesey 2000s highschool movies. And then she got pregnant. When she was 15, she had her daughter. She doesn't know who the father is, and any potential fathers for the girl up and left way back when. Her daughter is recently 16.

I never wanted kids, I found them annoying. But I fell in love with my wife and got married when she was 20 and I was 23 after dating for 2 years. We hit it off, and I married her and decided to suck it up around the kid.

I never planned to absolutely love being a dad to her specifically. Kids still annoy me, but my daughter (step daughter technically) was different. She was quiet, nerdy even at a young age. I married her mother when she was 5, and we clicked right away. We went on daddy-daughter dates every weekend. I played dolls with her. Let her paint my nails and do makeup on me. I drove her to and from school in my cop car. We even did daddy-daughter duo costumes for Halloween.

Over the past two years she's developed a darker dress style. I don't know what the proper subculture of her outfits are, but according to her she's dressing like a horror game protagonist and a Monster High character. Purple is her main color she incorporates into this specific ""aesthetic blend"" as she calls it. I don't get it, but maybe that's because I'm a man in my 30s, I don't know. She likes ghosts, tarot cards, vampires, zombies, aliens, creepy victorian dolls. I don't get it, but also I don't care because if it makes her happy so what? She's also an introvert, and prefers to play games on her computer or read fantasy occult novels rather than hangout with other teens her age. She has friends, so I'm not too worried about her being completely withdrawn. I'm just glad I don't have to drive her around since she only has a learner's permit currently.

My wife hates this. My wife always wanted a girly girl. Pinks and pastels and flowers and all that. She wants our daughter to get a boyfriend, be more social, be a cheerleader like she was. Which, in itself is valid. I get it, I'm sure most every parents has preferences for what they want their kid to turn out like, and some disappointment when they stray from that fantasy is valid. Some.

My wife will constantly takes and hides my daughter's darker room decor. She constantly gets pastel dresses for our daughter, tells her to wipe off her dark eye makeup, tries to set her up on dates with jock types from my daughter's school, and convince her to sign up for both school and summer activities like cheerleading or volleyball.

I could have put up with all of that, I really could have. But a few weeks ago I woke up to my wife finally hitting finally hitting her breaking point. I woke up in the middle of the night to my wife screaming and having what I can confidently describe as a borderline meltdown. She was crying and saying all she ever wanted was a normal daughter who likes pink, and is a cheerleader and has a boyfriend and will give her grandkids. I had to drag her out the hallway after 30 minutes of this. I kept thinking it would stop, but it kept going on and on. My daughter was just staring at this whole thing in the doorway of her room. What caused this meltdown from my wife? My daughter dyed purple over the blonde streaks/highlights my wife had forced her to get in her hair. Which wasn't even breaking a house rule, as my wife and I have both told her she can do whatever she wants with her hair as long as she doesn't stain too many towels.

It's been weeks, and my daughter won't talk to her mom. My wife is still up with her antics, but now it's in overdrive. Everyday she brings home some type of trendy clothing in pink or pastels and tries to give it to my daughter. My daughter is getting fed up and stays in her room all day, and has confessed to me she can't wait for school to start back up in a few weeks so she can get out the house and be with her friends again.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to ""side"" with anyone in this situation. I understand my wife wants a daughter who she can relate, and my daughter wants a mom who understands her. I don't know what I can or should do. I need help. I need advice."
dyzusp,My (39m) wife (38f) won't let our son (14m) sleep,11289,0.96,952,2019-11-20 15:13:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dyzusp/my_39m_wife_38f_wont_let_our_son_14m_sleep/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dyzusp/my_39m_wife_38f_wont_let_our_son_14m_sleep/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Hi r/all. Edit at bottom.

My wife has always been weird about sleep. She has always gotten angry at me if i fall asleep watching tv or want to sleep in longer than her. Even saying you are tired upsets her. She was like this before we married and ive personally made peace with the weirdness. Many arguments over years its not a marriage deal breaker. 

When she was a child she was her mothers emotional surrogate. She slept in same bed as mom and im assuming she controlled her sleeping schedule tightly enough its caused the issue. I mostly ignore the quirk and nap when im gonna nap now after 17 years of marriage im happy to ignore issue. 

But our son is now a teenager. And teenagers sleep schedules are odd. Ive previously shut down attempts for her to over control him if she had her way over years im sure there would be an r/insaneparents post about her. I offset it and push for his personal space privacy ect. But now shes getting concerned about his sleeping. Shes waking him up as soon as she does and talking about banning electronics and other punishments unless he wakes up at normal times ect. And im just... this is normal. You cant punish a teenager for their sleep schedule changing. (Edit. I have put a stop to this already now as its obviously not right. Im looking for advice to convince her to stop beyond putting foot down.)

He is a well behaved normal teenager. He has friends he does the dishes. He plays xbox gets good grades and afaik isnt yet a drug addict or joined a cult. He wakes up with his alarm and doesnt miss school he just wants to sleep in on a weekend. Normal punishments used in house are taking away an entertainment device for a set period based on what was done. Eg.pushes his sister no xbox for a week. 

Question: How do i have this conversation with her? Like an intervention. She hasnt crossed a line yet but im pretty sure sleep depriving a child can cross into child abuse. Shes a wonderful mom aside from this but shes just blinkered when it comes to other peoples sleep not matching hers. 

Tldr. Wife wants to control a teenagers sleep schedule. How do i convince her this is a bad idea/impossible/potentially child abuse? Am i the one whose wrong here and he should be under a tighter schedule? Its litterally just later nights and mornings.

Edit. Its getting hard to keep up with all the posts and reply. Thank you all for trying to help and sharing your own experiences. Im not able to reply to everyone but i am reading as much as possible.

Edit 3. Its hit all now and most new comments are people who havent read my replies and are repeating earlier advice or going the full nuclear suggestions.

Thank you all so much for your input im planning to have a conversation with my wife friday night as sat morning would be her next trigger point. I wont be logging back into this account from here unless i decide to post an update.

Once again for everyone who has put time and effort into helping here. Especially those who have shared personal stories of similar situations and the impact is has had on their adult lives. Its made it much clearer that i need to stand by my kids here and get my wife the help she deserves and needs. From what i know of her i believe she will take this well, we havent gotten this far without being able to deal with our issues."
bz7l6z,"My husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn’t tell me.",11280,0.83,3315,2019-06-11 09:17:53,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bz7l6z/my_husband_put_his_dick_in_my_cup_of_water_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bz7l6z/my_husband_put_his_dick_in_my_cup_of_water_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Okay, this is not a shitpost. I wish it was. I’m deeply disturbed. 

The other night after sex, as my husband and I were getting up and dressed, I asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. He was on his way out of the room, and said sure. He wasn’t mad about it, and sex was fine. We weren’t fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

As I walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

I don’t know what came over me, but I got this sixth sense, I don’t know how else to describe it. Maybe it was his shiteating grin, but I flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

He looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second I thought maybe I was being an idiot. 

He then says, how did you know?!?!

I was furious but it was such a strange situation so I just dumped it out and brushed it off. I didn’t know what else to do. 

The next day I asked him about it, and I asked why he did it. He said, I don’t know.  

I told him that it kind of made me upset, like I can’t trust him to get me a glass of water. It hurt my feelings. He immediately got defensive. 

We got into a fight about trust and he didn’t understand what the big deal was. I said, so what? Do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

He said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

I don’t know if he’d ever do that, and maybe it was just the way I phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. But, like wtf?

I don’t know what to think. 

Am I overreacting?

EDIT:

For those asking, we’ve been married almost 10 years now. He’s 34, I’m 32. 

Honestly I didn’t expect for this to blow up. I wrote a quick post and went to bed.

Thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, I’m trying to respond to as much as I can. 

Here’s my takeaway: 

Some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

But here’s the thing, he didn’t mean for me to find out. I asked him straight up and he told that he wasn’t going to say anything. No harm done! That he thought it was funny and that he didn’t know why he did it. He just did. 

So to me, it wasn’t done in a joking manner. 

After thinking about it, it’s more of a consent issue. To those asking, sure we just had sex and yes I suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. He violated boundaries and I feel upset about that.

UPDATE:

Whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

I’m going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not."
eu5gfv,My (21M) girlfriends (21F) wants to remain friends with her abusive ex boyfriend (28M) after he repeatedly told her he still loved her,11268,0.92,1942,2020-01-26 16:42:29,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eu5gfv/my_21m_girlfriends_21f_wants_to_remain_friends/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eu5gfv/my_21m_girlfriends_21f_wants_to_remain_friends/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False," 

My  (21M) girlfriend (21F) of 6 months has been friends with her ex boyfriend (28)  since we have been together. We are all at University. Me and my  girlfriend live with each other and 4 other people. We work great in  pretty much every aspect of our lives other than when there is any  situation that involves him. We usually have great communication, but  whenever it comes to this we always argue and things get heated.

2  months ago he told her when drunk on a night out that he still loved  her and wanted her back. They went and spoke while I went home. She  later arrived home in tears and I knew she had been with him. When she  fell asleep I made the awful mistake of looking at her phone because of  this. It's something I regret deeply as she lost a lot of trust in me.  The next day he asked her to forget about last night as he was drunk.  After speaking with her Mum my girlfriend decided not to mention it to  me as he was drunk (I'm fine with this decision).

Two  weeks later on a night out he said it again and tried to convince her to  come back with him to his house after a night out. She of course turned  him down. After that she decided to tell me about it. I was very  uncomfortable with the situation. He then text her asking if he could  talk to her about it all so they met up for coffee (with my knowledge).  During this conversation he told her how sorry he was for everything  that happened in their relationship and how much he wanted her back and  things would be different. He said if she didn't choose him then they  couldn't be friends any more. He then gave her a lovely necklace.

When  she came home she was incredibly upset by the situation and was in  tears for a very long time. I choose not to prow or ask any questions  about what he said or did but just cuddle and comfort her. She later  called up her mum to talk it through and then after that she told me  what happened. I tried to be as understanding as I could that night as I  knew she was upset by it. The next day we spoke about it, she still  wanted them to be able to be friends but I was very against it as it  made me very uncomfortable. I never trusted his intentions in being  friends with her in the past so I most certainly didn't now if he wanted  to become friends.

We then went  on Christmas break. During this time he messaged her a couple of times  and they spoke briefly and he didn't bring up his feelings. Then  suddenly did and asked to meet up. Later after she had told him no and  was trying to avoid the conversation, he got mad at her. They didn't  speak much after that other than the occasional message. During this  time he removed her and added her back multiple times on social media.

The  day we arrived back to University he messaged her and asked if he could  come and chat. I was home so she was comfortable saying yes. He then  poured out his love again and of course she said no (I was able to hear  the conversation with her knowledge). He walked off and they haven't  spoken since till today.

They are  both in rowing club together so they have to see each other sometimes  and would be seeing each other tomorrow for a race. He messaged her  asking to meet up and she went. He said he wanted to be able to be  friends and hang out and asked if they could start by going to the  library together and just hanging out. She said yes to this.

This  makes me extremely uncomfortable and caused a big argument between us.  She says I don't trust her, but I really don't trust him. In their  relationship he sometimes wouldn't take no for an answer and would  occasionally force himself on her. I don't understand why she would want  to be friends with him and I just can't trust him and I will always be  uncomfortable if she's with him. And she says although she understands,  she still wants to be friends with him as she is never going to  reciprocate his feelings and will never accept his advances but they  have been good friends for a long time and she doesn't want to throw it  away. It hurts when she says that I don't trust her, and I can see how  it can seem that way, and I think this stems from me looking at her  phone two months back, but I just can't stand him and feel disgusted  whenever he says something like he has been doing.

She  feels because he only wants to go to the library now that it's not  something I should stress out about and I'm overreacting to the  possibility of them hanging out again. She said if he does make it clear  he isn't okay to be friends again then she will stop hanging out with  him.

I love this girl with all my  heart and know I want to marry her and spend the rest of my life with  her, but I just can't stand her being with him and it's the only thing  we ever argue about.

We are both going to reading the answers to this post so would greatly appreciate some advice on the situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: My girlfriend still wants to be close friends with her ex boyfriend who has recently repeatedly told her he still loves her. When they were together he did awful things to her that still affect her today so I just don't approve of her seeing him. We both have very different views and need some advice on which of us is not seeing straight here."

Apparently I’m pioneering a new front in revenge porn... thanks guys very cool. I’m slowly parsing through comments, there’s no way I can reasonably respond to all of them but sincerely thank you all SO SO MUCH for your time and consideration :,,) I really really appreciate it and I am taking all of it to heart. Also when I posted this I was not expecting this much attention so I’ve removed some more identifying details and comments.

A couple more things— I’m seeing some hate for NSFW artists in the comments and I don’t want it to sound like I agree with that. Might not be my cup of tea but it’s still valid! But I hope maybe this is can be a reminder to artists (NSFW or not) of the power you have with your depictions, and to make sure your commissions aren’t going to unknowingly hurt anyone.

Second, for people asking I don’t really have an update to give right now because I haven’t done anything yet or formed a plan but I guess I can edit again or post an update when I do?

And lastly, to the Angry Men who think I should be grateful and take it as a compliment because ‘hey it’ll keep him from raping you’— I mean it from the bottom of my heart when I tell you to go fuck yourselves. Original post starts below.




So for context: we are college students (I am 21F and he’s 21M) who met freshman year (we’re juniors now) through mutual friends and have been acquaintances until this January, when we were in a discussion section for a class together and started talking more. It was just friendly, and stayed that way the whole time (I have had a string of not great romantic/sexual experiences in college and have sort of put a full pause on flirting, dating, etc. for a while and have always been very blunt with my friends, including him, about it). Since the pandemic hit I moved back home and we only communicate over text now. Let’s just call him James.

James’ roommate, Leon [22M], is tight with one of my best friends, Sam [21M]. Leon decided to move back home when school shut down as well, and while he was packing, he came across a rolled up small print in the back of their shared closet, and unrolled it to see if it belonged to him or not, The image was a drawing of a girl nude performing a sexually explicit act, and she looks.... exactly like me. Like I’m not even really friends with Leon and he immediately thought “oh, that kind of looks like OP”. Face, body type, even BOTH of my birthmarks (one in a very noticeable spot and one he would only know about from me mentioning it in passing) is all eerily similar to me. Leon immediately got spooked and took a photo of it and sent it to Sam because he thought I should be notified of the print’s existence. 

Sam forwarded it to me and I found the original artist’s Twitter handle off the signature. He’s an NSFW artist who also does commissions and will often post those commissions after completing them, and sure enough, I scrolled back far enough to find what is basically my naked body drawn on this man’s timeline, posted all the way back in FEBRUARY, which means James had paid for it like months ago, maybe right when we found out we had a class together. I’ve been talking to him for months and he’s had this for basically the whole time.

This discovery was two weeks ago and I feel fucking disgusting and honestly violated. I stopped talking to him for the most part— but I am afraid that he will circulate the image more if I stop speaking to him entirely or tell him that i know. His roommate promised not to say anything because he was pretty disgusted too and as far as I know he’s stayed true to that. I want to cut James off completely and I want the artist to remove the post of the commission from his Twitter, but I’m so scared and ashamed to reach out because I hate drawing more attention to the fact that this drawing even fucking exists, and I shudder thinking about the artist possibly using reference photos of me for the drawing.

So I guess my advice requests are:

1. Should I bother trying to get the post taken down and if I do, how do I make sure he does it?
2. Should I confront James? I never want to speak to this man again but I would be mortified if he circulated the image at all. Should I just block him? Is there someone I should report him to or something?
3. Is this an overreaction and should I do nothing? I haven’t told any of my friends besides the one who informed me because it makes me so uncomfortable and I need an outside perspective. I have never shown any kind of sexual interest in this man and just wanted to be his friend, and she showed absolutely zero interest in me as well. He’s had this image for months, all while still talking to me and it makes me feel so fucking icky and brings back memories of aforementioned shitty sexual experiences and I just don’t want to be around him.

Sorry if this was overly long, I’m just really over my head here.

TLDR: found out my “friend” commissioned an NSFW drawing that is unmistakably of me from an artist on Twitter and I don’t know how to remove him from my life without worrying about him circulating it or how to get it taken down from Twitter."

Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day. Thanks.

I first want to say thank you guys so much. I didn't think that I would get this much feedback.I started a family group chat and suggested that we should look into family therapy. Everyone is on board and is willing to do whatever it takes to make this situation work. I'm very lucky and I can see my privilege, many kids don't get what I got (a loving family) so maybe I was making this a bigger deal than it was. My sister said that she is going to make more of an effort to be in my life.  I think therapy might be good for us. As for douche husband, my sister really wants us to get along but I don't see that happening. Maybe he should come to therapy a few times but only if he's serious about it.  She is very mad at him but she wants to work things out with him.

Also, it was really interesting reading stories from people who have experienced something similar or know someone who did. It's crazy how often and common these things are. I guess until you experience something for yourself it can seem unbelievable. It was inspiring to read and some of them were heartbreaking and made me realize that I shouldn't let my anger make the decisions because life is short. My parents aren't getting any younger. I wouldn't want my last moments with them being something so negative. They still have to earn my trust but I don't see why we can't be on at least ok terms while they do. They've been extremely apologetic since but actions speak louder than words so we'll see.

Another issue that rose is the fact that I don't know where the other half of me came from. My biological father basically disappeared from my sister's life. I don't know if I should even bring it up because no one else has yet. That will be another topic of discussion for therapy I guess.

Thank you so much to those of you who were genuinely trying to be helpful and kind. I got a lot of support. Again thank you."

tldr:  dad thought I wasnt his kid and left me. Now, it turns out I am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. But it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so I dont really want to be his pal.

it is an ACT OF GOD that I still remember the password to this throwaway but fuck guys

The lab didn't make a mistake on my results, what they did is they MIXED the results of all children. I am my dad's bio son, but my older brother is NOT! Which is fucking weird cause he looks like dad, maybe mom has a type. Turns out it was his lab result stuff whatever with my name on it. He will be triple checking it now with another lab but I mean FUCK

the settlement has a confidential disclosure clause something on details so I will not be speaking about this ever ever in all ever again cause it's damn good money, so shush

I have no idea how to format sorry

So today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. Some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. So it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. And just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). I tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that I can't lie to her. At that point i think my face turned white and I legit had no idea what to even do or say.

I was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows. I also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so I can't say someone ratted me out. She said that it was the way I looked at her. I never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and I know there's not even a chance. But now that I know she knows, what do I do? Edit: Update tmrw after I have a talk with her."
a1x7uk,Should I (24M) leave my gf (24F) over her weight?,11143,0.82,2389,2018-12-01 04:02:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1x7uk/should_i_24m_leave_my_gf_24f_over_her_weight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1x7uk/should_i_24m_leave_my_gf_24f_over_her_weight/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. Ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and I love her to bits. She is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200B;

She has gained alot of weight and is now obese. I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200B;

It doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.

&#x200B;

Theres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200B;

You can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200B;

Edit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.

I am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. If I dont see any improvment then I know there is no hope and will leave her. Thanks again you lovely people, I will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200B;

Another Edit: I cannot reply to all your comments but I have read most of them! Some of your stories have been great to read. A quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. She took it really well. To all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, I dont know because she would never tell me her weight. I really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but I shall know in a few months. I will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too."

I don''t think any of you would care for an update so speaking to the void is just as good. So like a lot of you said, he tried to get me back. I got my now also ex-best friend to read the messages for me, apparently one of his older brothers told him he was a fucking moron and thats not how girls work. He texted me about how he loved me so much and that,but like again a lot of you said, that quickly changed to no-one but me can love you, come back to me,your just like other women, your all whores. You guys were right, I dodged a fucking bullet and he's never gonna get near a woman for the rest of his life.

I said this in the edit, but just after the breakup I had grief sex with my best friend, this didnt really sit right with me, and it continued to be wierd as i stayed there. It became glaringly obvious that my best friend wasnt my best friend and really just saw me as something to masturbate to, which I don't know it's horrifying and disgusting, just the way she looks at me isnt a crush, its fucking perversion. she said she'd ""wait for me"" whatever the fuck that means, but she seemed pretty fucking impatient for me to get over him. The first time we had sex my emotions were high and i was vulnerable, i truly felt alone, but now that i'm no longer so vulnerable she keeps trying to make me hurt emotionally again,see if i'll have sex with her again. She'd bring me a drink then bring up traumatic events from my life and she'd fucking smile when she saw me get upset. So yeah, I'm at my moms house and I'm a fucking wreck, 2020 better end with something good cos honestly i hate my life right now. Having trust in people is a concept long forgotten and every time I think of the way my now ex bf looked at me when he hated me to my core or how my ex best friend would look at me I just feel sick to my stomach and want to hide.

My mom thinks the reason I attract these people is because of my dad. She left him when I was 12 but I guess it warped my perception of men and of what love was. It made my boundaries for what isnt okay so far away from reality. So yeah I'm pretty much screwed without therapy ( Spoiler I cant afford therapy), and my dads actions are gonna follow me for the rest of my life yay. My life is a shitty ultimatum of be alone forever or be surrounded by your father forever. Anyway thats basically it, my mom is definately the mvp of my life, and yeah."
bl31eh,My Roommate's(21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21 F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.,11082,0.97,856,2019-05-06 02:35:47,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"TLDR: MY roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment 

Backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. I was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. Recently, MY PARENTS got ME an apartment and pay  RENT every month. So pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

Over the past few months when we come home from class,  we have walked in on
1. Her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. Her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. HER MOM CLEANING MY FUCKING CLOSET and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. Her Mom and dad chillin at the apartment Friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

I just can't deal anymore. I told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said I'm overreacting. Am I overreacting? Should I tell my parents?

I have lost my mind. Literally. Udhdudbdu helpppp.

Edit 2: Imma tell my parents about it. I just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

Mini update: I took out edit 1 to shorten the post. I told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying I can put a lock on my bedroom door. Me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. Her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. She doesn't look too happy. I'll update you all again when I tell my parents.

Edit: sorry for all the edits but I think I need to clarify something. The reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. He said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

I'm sorry if this comes across as panicky or desperate but I don't know what to do and need some advice.

I have been seeing my boyfriend for three months. He is a really good guy overall but when it comes to sex related things he steps over the line way too much. Since our relationship began, he has been obsessed with my past relationships and past sexual encounters. Most of these happened when I was in high school. More than that, he is super obsessed about my relationship with my ex girlfriend. I am bisexual and he asks me a lot of graphic questions about what we did together.

I'm open and sexual so it doesn't bother me, but the line keeps getting pushed further and further back. When we're hooking up he'll ask me to tell him how much better he makes me feel than my ex. It is a big turn-on for him to be told that he's the best I've ever had and so I put up with it to make him happy. But two nights ago he pushed it even more and told me he wanted me to text my ex and tell her how he turned me completely straight.

At least I refused right there and told him to never ask that again. He seemingly understood, but when I woke up the next morning I had been messaged by my ex asking me what was wrong with me. I didn't understand but she sent me screenshots of the texts he sent and then deleted, and they were shocking. He was talking about how only d*ck can please me now and how scissoring with her was boring and lame compared to what a man could do. A lot of it had big overlap with what he wants me to say to him all the time. I was completely in shock.

My boyfriend denies sending the messages too despite it being impossible they came from anywhere else. Only he and I know about what he says to me in bed and I certainly didn't say those things. How can I make him understand that he crossed the line way too far this time?

tl;dr: my boyfriend sent messages to my ex using my phone, presumably when I was asleep or away from it"

We have had a strong friendship from middle school all the way until we graduated from the same college. We have always been there for each other, and I tell her pretty much everything.

Back in junior year of high school, a guy (we'll call him Rod) raped me at a house party. He never apologized for it, and it put me in a deep downward spiral to the point where I almost wanted to drop out in order to never see his face again. I told Tina about it, and she did everything she could to support me.  

Fast forward to early 2020, Tina and her boyfriend (Josh) announced that they were getting engaged, and Tina wanted me to be the maid of honor. I was beyond excited to do it, we've always talked about being each other's maids of honor. There was another detail though, Josh had a similar friendship history with his best man and they thought it would be adorable if the maid of honor and best man worked together on everything and were they're own second package on the wedding day. I guess it was their way of making us feel a little more excited for weddings of our own.

I found out that the best man was going to be Rod, and that he and Josh remained best friends after high school. I thought Rod was just in the friend group, but it turns out they were as close as could be. My heart sunk and I simply didn't know how to respond. They expected us to work together and be together the whole wedding process, and that sounded like literal hell.

I started thinking about whether Tina never told Josh or that Josh heard and just didn't care, all I know is that I was having second thoughts about the wedding after that.

I texted Tina about my concerns with Rod coming in the most polite way possible, and she sent me this in reply:

""I know about what happened with you guys back in the day, but Rod seems to be a great guy now. It would just really mean a lot if you can push that memory away for the duration of this? Please just trust me""

I didn't know how to respond to this, and luckily the wedding planning process has been at a haul since Covid. I haven't responded to her since that text but now this has really been bugging me. Should I just say no? It would probably break her heart, but I just don't know if I can handle working with my rapist.

I came out at fourteen and everyone was very supportive. My parents have finally become accustomed to it and me and my sister bonded because she was lesbian.

It was the most disgusting and unenjoyable experiences of my life. I struggled to get my solider at attention for like twenty minutes. It was bad honestly. 

To make sure that it wasn't just that guy, I tried again with another dude. Same thing happened and so I've come to a conclusion. I'm not gay 

So to make ABSOLUTELY sure I slept with a girl. An actually enjoyable experience for once and that's when I was sure.

Sporadically occurring symptoms have included chronic muscle and joint pain to the point I struggled to get out of bed, skin infections, serious fatigue, hair loss and frequent cold/flu like viruses. 

At first he was really understanding, would comfort me and sympathise with how doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong but for the last year and a half he has started suggesting it’s in my head or I’m exaggerating the symptoms.  This hurt so badly because doctors for that last several years have basically said the same thing. I was prescribed pain killers, told I was ‘just’ depressed and given AD’s, or just straight up dismissed. So I stopped bothering. 

Then about two months ago I had to go get a script filled and she was so lovely that I started talking about some of this stuff. She ordered a bunch of tests and through intensive questioning and reviewing of my medical history I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. 

Thankfully it’s something that with appropriate medical care and treatment it can be managed and I’m now starting to feel better. My husband has profusely apologised and has been really supportive but I still feel hurt and kind of betrayed that he didn’t believe that I knew there was something wrong. He saw the pain I was in but believed I was putting it on.

So, I tried it. I thought that maybe I was being too close minded and so I went for it. It went fine, but it still really isnt my thing. But here's the bad part.

She didnt like it at all. Even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. This would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. She says that I sabotaged it because I didnt want to do it. But i didnt. I did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. She was really the director here. But somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

Im pretty livid about this. I went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. And I feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. It feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes I ruined it on purpose. We had a fight over this and we broke up.

I'm sorry if the title makes me (M, 31) seem like a horrible person. Maybe I am, and I need external opinions to tell me that.

My partner (F, 35) has vaginismus; that is, she cannot tolerate anything penetrating her vagina. Sexually, that means no penetrative sex, but it also means she can't use a tampon or get a cervical smear.

She told me this when we first got together, but she also said she had been recommended by a doctor to try using special medical vaginal cones as treatment, which when used over a month or two get the vagina used to ""accepting"" penetration. She had been doing this for a number of months before we got together, and so when we tried to have sex for the first time, it was actually successful and didn't hurt her. I remember how delighted she was.

So for the first year or so, when we lived apart, we had plenty of sex (as almost all new couples do). I believe she enjoyed it; sometimes she even initiated. But when we moved in together we stopped having regular sex. It became sporadic, and then stopped completely. In the end, we went so long without having sex that her vaginismus returned, so when we \*did\* finally try again, it hurt her and we couldn't proceed.

We now haven't had sex in over five years, almost six, but every time I brought it up she tried to change the subject. Sometimes she would promise to start using the ""cones"" again, but she would always quietly give up after a week without saying anything. In January I sat her down and told her that I loved her, but I couldn't live never having sex again. She agreed she would try the treatment again.

Yesterday, I asked her how it was going (having not mentioned it at all in the two months between, as I don't want to put her under pressure), and she did not take it well. She reacted very badly. She told me that she had stopped weeks ago because she was just too tired in the evenings, and that if I wanted her to do it so badly so that ""you can have sex with me"" (her words) then I needed to remind her to do it.

I'm just so tired of this. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be the one reminding her, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it feels really grimy and unpleasant to be telling her to do it, because it feels like I'm trying to take control of her body and sexuality. It's also putting all the responsibility on me.

Secondly, it makes it seem very clear that this is being done purely for my benefit. She's not doing this because *she* wants to have sex; she's doing it so that *I* can have sex with her. That is very unappealing and makes me feel unwanted. I want to have sex with her for the emotional connection and the mutual passion/desire. If it's being delivered to me simply to keep me ""happy"" then that's not what I want at all, and defeats the entire purpose. She also claimed we could just do ""other things"" (ie, oral sex) so she doesn't see why it's a big deal, but that to me is the same thing. She'd be going down on me purely to get me off and therefore ""keep me quiet"", not because of any actual desire to do it for playful reasons.

I asked her if she had a sex drive at all, and said that it's ok if she didn't, and she got upset and offended and claimed she definitely did. But when I asked how she reconciled that with not ever actually taking the necessary steps to have that sex, she just got more upset and told me she was tired all the time. 

If this was the first time this had happened, I could understand it. But it's not. This happens on a cycle. I bring up that I'm dissastisfied with our sex life, she promises she'll work on it, then she gives up without saying anything and gets upset with me when I find out. Then the very next day won't talk about it and pretends like everything is normal and we hadn't had the conversation at all.

I need some advice to get my head straight. I'm becoming incredibly dissatisfied with this relationship, and I think it's beginning to colour my opinions on every other aspect. Otherwise, we're a good couple. She's a wonderful and thoughtful person.

I just feel so unwanted and undesired. I lost three stone last year and got in shape in an effort to make myself more desirable to her, and whilst she says all the right things about how nice I look, her words sound hollow or superficial. She never acts on it. I've noticed much more attention from other women since I got in better shape, so I genuinely think I must be at least reasonably ok-looking, but every time it happens my mind just circles back to why doesn't my partner feel the same way? Honestly, it makes me feel ugly. My self-confidence is in the toilet.

Can anyone give any recommendations to how I can get myself through this? Is there a way I can approach this that won't upset her? Maybe I just need to hear from someone with vaginismus or a low sex drive that it's not something she can change, and I need to stop thinking about sex so much. Perhaps I am being incredibly unkind, focusing so much on sex when there are more important things in life.

Thank you."
bd9kir,I (22 F) got left at the alter a week ago yesterday.

I had NO clue whatsoever. 

He waited until our wedding day to leave me a note in my hotel room that contained this information. 

I am sad, angry, and confused. 

I wish he had told me long before the day of the ceremony and spared me the extreme pity and humiliation I went through that day. 

Now he wants to meet in person to apologize and say goodbye. 

Should I go?"
1dw3fk0,Update. I (f30) Had to protect his niece from a pitbull And my husband (m31) ran off. I have been ignoring him is this something that I should be forgiving him for?,10912,0.98,463,2024-07-05 22:58:24,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dw3fk0/update_i_f30_had_to_protect_his_niece_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dw3fk0/update_i_f30_had_to_protect_his_niece_from_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"My friend said, that people update often, but I don’t know how to attach it to the other post? I thought I’d update since there had been a few things that happened kinda? Sorry if this is needlessly long…
And I didn’t expect this to get this many comments and kindnesses. And I want to say I’m so sorry to everyone that has experienced anything similar, because, my god, it has not been easy.

For everyone worried about my mental health, I did get in through an app with my work yesterday , because I decided I really needed it, and labeled it high priority. However it felt like it was just a parliamentary meeting, and she said she wanted to get me to feeling a bit more comfortable, because I was  visibly tensing up whenever I started talking about it, and she even noticed it through the video chat.

Last night, also I told me husband I needed space. I apologize that I don’t have more of an update on our relationship than that. I wasn’t as nice as I wanted to be—he argued and didn’t want to leave (it’s my house), but I told him I just didn’t want to look at him, that I couldn’t look at him. He cried and I hate that I felt apathetic towards it. I haven’t slept well so I’m not sure I’m also just over tired and still so shaken though, I was also emotionally exhausted after the appointment so that might have added to it.

I got a few questions about his sister and her husband, so I thought I’d answer.
They aren’t speaking with him. I don’t know when it happened I was definitely out of it at the hospital while I was getting the stitches and everything, but I do think after I was done blubbering and trying to explain how something so terrible happened to there little girl under our watch they apparently ask him where he was, I still haven’t talked to him about where he went, so I don’t know. however it clearly didn’t satisfy them.

His niece just got out of the hospital yesterday, so that really triggered everything and a lot happened. I had sent flowers, and a bear, and this one toy-thing she’d been asking about. I didn’t go to he hospital though, I was scared seeing me would make her nervous. 
But his sister and her husband sent me flowers too, and it made me bawl again. I’m just a freaking mess, honestly. The father sent me a long message that I haven’t been able to get through but it’s the sweetest things anyones ever sent to me…he also sent me a 1k visa card. I literally thought I was reading the amount wrong…
They are good people and I still feel terrible i couldn’t have done more for her. Everything’s just replaying in my head.

Anyway. I obviously haven’t looked into filing yet, but I am not against the idea of it, and it really did help me feel better about wanting a divorce over this. I know fight or flight can’t be helped, but now I think I realized that it’s okay not to want to be which someone who would leave you behind. I think I can say I’m a fighter. And I want a fighter with me. Maybe he’d be better off with a runner instead too. Then he at least wouldn’t be leaving someone behind.

I don’t know… it feels like I’m done. But I’m also just a mess, so right now I’m just glad I have space.

Thank you for everyone making me feel like I wasn’t being ridiculous, though, I think it always feels like it should be multiple issues that tear a marriage apart, (unless it’s infidelity or something) and it’s like i know he may not have meant to betray me…but he still did. Whatever his reasoning. Not sure when I’ll be speaking to him, but I will try to update then. "

All of us live in the same state, just different cities. Due to our work schudules, I don't see my family often.

My parents stayed over at my sister's for my birthday. I was gonna go over to her place and spend it as a family because it seemed easier that way and I don't like surprises anyway so it works out.

However, yesterday I got a call from my parents saying that they'll come visit me instead and that my sister can't make it. I called her to see what was wrong. Turns out that my parents found my sister's sex toy and had a dramatic episode over it and demeaning her for owning them.


They said it was better if she didn't show up. Basically, the conversation comes down to, ""mom and dad yelled at me for owning a dildo.

Sex toys are fairly common and my sister is an adult. At the end of the day, she isn't hurting anyone, but now my parents are making a big deal out of nothing. And while I could spend my birthday with my parents and visit my sister some other time, it just isn't the same.

I wish I was making this up. Is there any way I can spend my birthday with my whole family and not have them fight over something so stupid?

Thank you."

He also said that it's a turn off that I slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

He said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

I find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. I'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

Edit: for those of you judging the amount of partner he has had in the past, your view is just as bad as his.

Update/edit?: This really got a lot more attention then i was expecting and he has now also seen this post.  I really appreciate everyone's advice but I dont think am ready to make a rash decision just yet (much to the annoyance of most people on this thread). I've taken on bored some of the advice being said and think that I need to sit down and have proper conversations with him before i decide if i should continue this or not. I think I should hear him out when I have calmed down a bit and am less angry to give him a chance to explain his point of view."
a25cg7,How do I (34M) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34F) that has no life skills?,10892,0.87,979,2018-12-01 23:48:43,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a25cg7/how_do_i_34m_break_up_with_my_long_time_depressed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a25cg7/how_do_i_34m_break_up_with_my_long_time_depressed/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Genders are actually reversed, he knows I've been browsing this sub lately and I'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

I'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. He has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. He never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. It's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. None of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

I feel like a bad person, but I don't see a future together that I want. I just wish I'd come to this realization sooner.

We have no kids, only 3 cats. We're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). Only thing I can think of is he's on the bank account, but I doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. I'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... We've paid off about 40k of it. Or technically, I have.

He's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and I worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. I still care very much for him, but I can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

How do I break up? I don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, I want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

Update : I told him I wanted to break up. Said this wasn't the life I wanted, and that I gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. I'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this Thurs to work on any sticking points.

Then left the house. He wants to know why now, why can't I give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. I had to leave, or I'm going to start saying things I regret or break down. Not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so I won't be bored (what can i say, I'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

I'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

Update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. I lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

I didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. I had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, I'm going to leave it up. Its not that I'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. I knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). I'll try to post other updates too. I appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. Sorry if I don't have time to reply to everyone.

And if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close I can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. I'd rather you didn't read this.

Update #3 : He's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. No logistics have been discussed except it sounds like I won't see him for a bit. I've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. Have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. They all heard from him first, except his sister who I gave a heads up to (with no details). It's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I want these people to be there for him when I'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

I'm not sure I should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. Gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. Not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

I'm tired and think I can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as I sorted this all out. Will try to respond to questions later.

Update #4 : I really appreciate all the support, it's more than I can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when I need it. And I've needed a lot of it.

He's back and staying in a separate room for now. This is his home too, I'm not going to force him out the first night when I've already ruined his life. I planned to keep my distance, but I'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes I sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. He knows he fucked up. I'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him I want it done by the end of the month. If he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

Also I'm seeing a lot of questions about if I'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man I needed. I don't know. I'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, I'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when I'm ready to go looking again. I know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. He's been my best friend for 16 years, and I still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. We grew up together and been through a lot. I don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and I changed. I'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and I'm the one that changed to realize I was not ok with it anymore too.

And to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. Maybe for some it is, but that's not who I am. I want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. And is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. This has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. I want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone I have to fight and drag along.

Thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. I'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. Maybe I'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

Update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than I thought. I thought my tears would be done by now. The optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person I need. I miss and love him so much. But I've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. The support here keeps me going, I can't tell you all how much I appreciate it. It's going to be a rough few weeks, but I can do this.  I keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

Like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. I feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

The lack of support for me has been hard. Only his mom has asked how I've been, and wanted my side. I think she understands. We were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. I knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. I'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. But I still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people I know. Maybe I'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

He's I think out of the house for good now. Not sure, but I told him either he goes, or I find a temp apartment this week. He left while I was sleeping and hasn't been back. I haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. He's a good guy, I wish I had said a better goodbye. Given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. I know it's better this way, I can't be the one there for him now. It hurts, but I know it's for the best

Update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and I didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. I consider that progress. Some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. Each time it happens, I try to identify the cause. Usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt I've caused someone. It's hard not to miss him, but I feel a lightness about being free. And I'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. Bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. I'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment Thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

I've barely seen or talked to him since I broke it off. I don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. I said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it Thursday. I really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. Misses him so much, not eating much. She's 20lbs, and loves food. He stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that I just gave her. I try to show her extra love, but I can tell she misses him. And he probably misses her.

I've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. And writing in a private diary document. It's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. For example, if I start thinking maybe I could have tried another ultimatum, I can just go back and re-read what happened the first time I gave one. Or if I get to feeling I could have tried harder, I can go back and read all the things I did try over the past year. Writing it out and talking to others really does help.

My wife and I have been married 2 years, 4 together total.

I grew up in Europe and circumcision is extremely rare there. Apparently it is much more common in the US.

All her past BF were circumcised and she says she prefers it that way.

She stopped giving my oral sex once we got married and she says it’s because she doesn’t like doing it for me because of how I am not snipped.

She also calls it anteater penis and makes increasingly disgusted faces when we have sex.

I am willing to do this in order to make her happy but I just want to know you’re all thoughts about this.

TL;DR: wife doesn’t like my “anteater” dick as she calls it so she wants me to get circumcised.

To give a bit more context, he’s white and 100% Canadian, and I was born in Kenya (moved to Canada when I was 1). I had never met his parents because they live 3 hours away from us and he’s not super close to them anyway. 

When lockdown started and both our jobs closed, he asked if I wanted to spend a few weeks with them, so I could meet them and visit his hometown. I said ‘’sure, sounds fun!’’

We drove there on a Friday night and when my bf introduced me to his parents, they were super nice. We were talking, laughing, all that good stuff. When it was getting late, my bf and I decided to prepare for bed and went upstairs. When he was already in bed, he realized he forgot his charger downstairs and asked me if I could please go get it. 

When I was walking down the stairs, I heard his mother (still at the kitchen table) mention my name, so being noisy, I stopped and listen. They said I was nice and I was happy to hear that, but then his father said ‘’it’s a shame she’s a nigg*r though’’. His mother answered ‘’as long as he doesn’t marry her, it’s fine. And he won’t, he knows we would be disappointed’’. I kind of froze up, waited for them to change the subject, got my bf’s charger and went upstairs. 

I didn’t know how to feel, and I still don’t. I’m lucky enough to have never dealt with this kind of racism, so I’m a bit lost on what to do. What his mother said implies my bf knows his parents are not happy with him being with me. Is this why he’s waited so long to introduce them to me? And why didn’t he warn me that his parents don’t want him dating a black girl? Do I even talk to him about it? I don’t want to cause more drama, but at the same time, I’m mad. And also sad. I know we’re not there yet, but would his parent’s disapproval stop him from marrying me? And if we have kids, will their grandparents hate them because they’re not white enough? I love my boyfriend so much and I know he loves me, but I don’t know what to do and how to go about this."

Two weeks ago, it was mine and Mark’s anniversary, we’ve been dating for two years. We had plans after he finished work, but he never showed up. I tried to call and text him, but he ignored me all day and didn’t contact me until after 1am. He was drunk and went on a rant about how I deserved this because I shouldn’t have invited Jason (my ex) to my parents’ house. I was pretty mad at him and told him I thought we should break up. He ended apologizing profusely and assuring me he would never do something like that again and he was just feeling insecure. I decided to give him a second chance.

To clarify about Jason, we had an amicable break up three years ago because we didn’t like having a long-distance relationship whilst he was away for med school. My dad had a heart attack a week before my anniversary and Jason\*\* went to see him since his mom is friends with mine. Me and Mark turned up whilst he was there. Jason was discussing some of the treatment options the doctors had given my dad with my mom. He left a little while later. When he left, my mom made a comment about how helpful Jason was. Mark mentioned later that he didn’t like that Jason was there or what my mom said about him, but I reassured him he was there as a family friend and not an ex. He seemed to be over it after that.

Yesterday, Mark’s friend Penelope mentioned how Mark had gone out with her and a group of her friends that day. I’m furious because he told me he had spent the day at a bar alone getting drunk. Mark doesn’t understand why I’m angry over this since I already forgave him for missing our anniversary.

TL;DR – My boyfriend got jealous because my ex visited my sick dad so he stood me up on our anniversary as “revenge”. He claimed he was at a bar alone, but I just found out he was with a female friend (and her friends). He doesn’t understand why I’m angry.

\*\*Just to clarify about the original, I didn’t invite Jason over, we haven’t spoken since 3 months into my relationship with Mark, his mom asked him to visit. I didn’t know he was going to be there.

**UPDATE –**

After I posted my original post, I asked Mark for some space to think and went to stay with my parents. He was upset but said he would respect my decision. He did send me one text after I left which said he was sorry, and he loved me.

Jason’s mom called me the day after to ask if she could give him my number. This was very random since he’s always respected my decision not to stay in touch with him, so I figured it had to be something important. I gave her the go ahead and Jason called me later in the day. He sounded pretty irritated on the phone and asked me to tell my boyfriend to leave him alone. Mark had been harassing him on facebook all day since I moved out. He’d sent him some nasty and threatening messages and he also commented on every picture that included me on his profile. Mark’s messages read like he was drunk, not that that is an excuse. Jason did block him, but Mark kept making new accounts. I was super embarrassed by his behavior and apologized to Jason and told him I’d talk to Mark.

Mark denied it. He tried to say Jason faked the screenshots he sent me to make Mark look bad. When I told him I didn’t believe him, he got angry and tried to twist it back onto me again. He asked me why Jason even had my number, why we were even talking to each other and he accused me of letting him ruin our relationship. He also made a comment about how I should just go f\*ck Jason if that’s what I wanted.

I think my relationship is dead. I wanted to try to address his jealousy and how he handles it to see if we could work things out, but he just isn’t willing/able to talk about it without getting defensive. The last conversation I had with Jason was him sending me a screenshot of Mark apologizing to him but this just feels performative now.

I don’t really know what I’ll do now but I’ll post a final update when I’ve made my decision.

TL;DR – I went to stay with my parents so I could have space to think about the state of our relationship. My bf decided to use that time to harass my ex over facebook. He still refuses to see his jealousy is irrational and twists everything to make it my fault."

A bit over a week ago I made a post about my husband giving me a black eye whilst he was drunk and threatening to do it again despite the fact that I was holding our son. 

This update is to say: 

1) although in the moment I couldn't fully admit it to myself let alone anyone else, it was obviously not an isolated incident of violence. It was just the worst incident of violence. 

2) there's a lot right now I don't want to talk about, including the details of things leading up to the process of leaving (which was completed on Tuesday of this past week) but

3) as now my son and I made it safely home to my mam and dad. This is by no means the end of anything as there's so much more that needs to be taken care of and done, but I didn't wish to leave people to wonder. My main priority is to keep my son safe and removed from the situation and he is. 

Trying to keep this as brief and low drama as possible but wanted to let people know that we did get out and are in a safe spot."

I contacted her, and she responded.",10815,0.97,362,2023-01-26 17:43:08,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10lqf48/update_i_35m_was_incarcerated_and_lost_touch_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10lqf48/update_i_35m_was_incarcerated_and_lost_touch_with/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Previous post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRA9478385939/comments/10m65ze/i_35m_was_incarcerated_and_lost_touch_with_33f/). The short version is that I was wondering whether I should try to contact my former girlfriend after I went to prison for a long time. The consensus was that I should, and people gave very good advice on how to do that.

First, I want to say thank you to everyone who offered advice or kind words. I had spent so long feeling ashamed about my situation, and expecting most people to react very negatively if they knew. I had barely discussed it with anyone before, except my dad and people whose job it is to help me (lawyers, therapist, etc.), and I was very surprised to be met with so much compassion from a bunch of complete strangers. Thank you, truly. Several people asked for an update, and that’s the least I can do in return.

I sent Daria a message the evening after I made my post. It was something like: «I don’t mean to intrude, but I wanted to say hello and thought I would give you my new contact information in case you ever felt like getting in touch. If not, that’s completely fine too.» I left her my mobile number and email address, wished her well, and that was that. I knew it might be a while before she responded, if she responded at all. So I tried to put it out of my mind.

Early monday morning, my phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number from the country where Daria lives. Who else would ever be calling me from there? I panicked a little bit, but I managed to answer in time.

She asked a few times if it was really me, and I couldn’t tell if she was laughing or crying. At first she called me by the very affectionate version of my name she used to. But then she quickly apologised and corrected herself, which broke my heart a little bit. It was an awkward phone call, but not in a bad way. I was extremely nervous, and it seemed like she was too. But happy, also.

Some of you mentioned that Daria would want to know that I was safe, and this was more true than I could have guessed. Because unrest in my country increased a lot during the last year I was in prison, she was afraid that they would decide to quietly kill me rather than let me go. There are documented cases of other prisoners like me having met very suspicious ends in the months before my release, so it wasn’t a totally unreasonable worry. 

She also said she repeatedly tried to send me parcels of supplies and put money on my commissary account, but her attempts were rejected without explanation. After my sentencing, I was not allowed to receive correspondence or to have a commissary account at all, because of the classification of my crimes, so she was forced to give up. She told me this as an apology, as if I would have been disappointed with her for not helping me more. I had no idea she had done any of that. I do know that it was not a safe thing for her to do, and I feel terrible that she put herself at risk trying to make me a little more comfortable.

She didn’t seem to want to talk about what happened any more than that, and so we didn’t. We changed the subject to more lighthearted things: our jobs, the cities where we live, how my dad is adapting to a new country, etc. When she arrived at work and had to end the phone call, she asked if I wanted to continue talking through a messaging app. Obviously I said yes, and downloaded it immediately. We sent messages throughout the day, and she even interrupted her commute home to send me a picture of a restaurant modelled after one of my favourite books, just because she thought I would like it. She told me that she thought of me every time she saw it, but unfortunately the restaurant itself was not so good. I was afraid she wouldn’t remember me, but she even remembers the things I liked to read? She remembers a lot of little things, even stuff I forgot.

We have been sending messages back and forth ever since, and talking on the phone after I finish work at night, until she gets too sleepy. Sometimes it feels like I’m 24 and she’s texting me from a few blocks away, as if the next thing she might ask is what’s for dinner. Other times it seems like we’re trying to will dead versions of ourselves back to life in order to avoid acknowledging what we’ve lost. She seems a lot more timid than she used to, more passive, which I suppose makes sense. Sometimes I worry about how much I’ve changed, and that maybe she won’t find anything left in me that’s worthy of her. But if I could express in words what it feels like to hear her laugh, I could explain that there’s also a lot that we know very well. She hasn’t lost her kindness, or her warmth, or her empathy. She still cares about me, and I still care about her. I know that rebuilding a friendship after all that’s happened will take lots of patience, and I have plenty to spare. I’m just happy to have the chance to get to know her again. 

This morning, Daria asked if I want to have a video call sometime this weekend. I agreed, but I’m ashamed to admit that as much as I want to see her, I’m very nervous. I look so different than she would remember. My jaw is messed up, and I have the teeth of a hockey player. (Fortunately, I will qualify for healthcare insurance soon and be able to have it fixed.) I lost weight that I haven’t put back on, and I see an old man in the mirror. I’m also worried that I will get very emotional when I see her, and embarrass myself that way. I don’t really cry in front of people. I’m not used to it, and this doesn’t seem like a good occasion to start. Aside from not wanting to appear pitiful, I don’t want her to feel forced to comfort me. If anyone has some advice on how to handle this, it would be much appreciated.

Overall, this week could not have gone better, and I am extremely grateful to everyone who gave me the little push of courage I needed to send her that message. A thousand times, thank you.

TL;DR: I sent a message to my former partner, she was thrilled to receive it, and we have been happily getting to know each other once again.

Edit: Just to clarify, she doesn’t have a husband or kids. As I said in my first post, I only considered contacting her because there was no evidence of a partner on her social media. But I understand that my first post wasn’t visible for a while, so I can see why that may not have been obvious. Sorry for the confusion."

I've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

My wife and I have been married for 4 years. We argue sometimes over little things but I love her with all my heart. There's never been anything wrong until now. I thought we were happy, I always treated her right and got listened to her. I took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. She doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so I gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because I wanted her to be great. She goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

I'm not close to my mother at all but I see her from time to time. Recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. She was horrible to me growing up but I tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. She has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. She recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him X. My mother invites me and my wife and It's the first time they all meet. Probably 4th time I've met him since they married fairly quickly. He seemed.. Okay. Just really didn't like his vibe too much. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

Last year, X asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. My wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, I agreed. I thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. X and my wife really hit it off and I'm not very good with construction/renovation related things I ended up going out with my Mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. It was weird but we tried. My wife stayed behind and helped X remodel. Her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than I about how to help fix the house up.  They seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when I wasn't around and super animated conversations but I didn't think much of it because I assumed she was just being nice to my new ""Step Father."" I trusted my wife. 

She started going back over to my mother's house to help X out afterwards. They live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. I noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. She kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since I wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. It was like once or twice a week. This started happening early this year. When the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which I didn't mind. I guess that makes me stupid. When her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. She seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. I tried to go with her to my Mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and I didn't really like X's humor/mannerisms. I didn't mind, I worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

A few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. I always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. She was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. It does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. I didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. I tapped her screen to see what it was and I recognized the number. It was X's. He sent multiple MMS messages with his face and nude pics of himself. There were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. Just alot of words I haven't processed yet. I took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know I saw. I really wish I didn't. I really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. There are MONTHS of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, I took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the Midwest. He's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. She doesn't know I'm leaving in Jan which is when our lease is up. I told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. I came back and she didn't seem any different. Our anniversary is the day before Christmas Eve.  I haven't told my mother, not sure how or if I want to. I haven't told anyone except you, reddit. I want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

It's been a while but I still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. I feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. I already feel broken and empty. I left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. I thought she was happy. We have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time I found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. I need some time to think and I need to know how to fix this with my wife? How do I tell my mother? I love my wife with everything she's all I have I gave her everything these last 4+ years. I cant just  divorce, Im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

I know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but I don't think i can lay next to her anymore. I've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. I'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. She's already called me 3 times and I'm just exhausted emotionally. It hurts ignoring her calls. I'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if I have the time. Im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but I hope you have advice.

It all came to a head last night.  She just came out and asked me if I did not love her anymore and all that I could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

This started a larger conversation that I won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that I would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that I would have felt like I could have worked on it.  I would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  But to know that I was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something I thought I could get over any time soon or if I ever could for that matter.

I was even honest and said that if it was just a ONS she had or some random guy who was just huge I might be able to get past that.  But knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when I met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than I could handle.

She kept trying to tell me how much better I was at everything else and that I should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  I told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes I needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that I can never be.

I tried my best to be gentle, I tried to take all of the blame of stating that I knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who I am.  

BTW I'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

This is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  I am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  Everybody's Christmas is ruined.  We had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

This alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am I going to say is the reason why we are not together?  She didn't cheat and if I say that I felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  It's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

In the end I feel like a massive failure.  I feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and I feel like a failure because I wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

She has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially I said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  We can talk about every single thing and I can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who I wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what I do I will never be as good as her ex.  I just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

But because she legitimately seems heartbroken I agreed to go.  But that does  not mean I will keep going.  

Today I moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until I can get a place for myself.  She has been with her sister all day.  

I feel like shit.  

Thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  I honestly have tried to read everything even if I didn't reply to very many.

The bitch of all of this is that I still love her.  There is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

EDIT:  Well once again I posted this and then went away for awhile.  I went with my friend to see Mortal Engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so I started reading awhile ago.  It is going to take me forever to read and once again I don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  But thank all of you for reading and responding.

EDIT 2:  I guess I do want to share one thing I spoke with her about.  When we were having our very long conversation I presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  I know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  So I put the scenario to her like this.  I said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend Tim and you heard this.  ""Jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way Tiffany did""  ""But its not Jill's fault Tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person I've ever known and Jill just isn't as smart"".  Then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""I love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""Nobody makes a sandwich like you do and I think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
At first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   She ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  I then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw I would never say to anyone out loud about anyone I loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
EDIT 3:  If anyone even reads this I want to add one last thing.  People have been telling me what a whiny bitch I am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because I can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  Not going to lie and say I'm thrilled with it but I'm not dumb enough to think I have a giant magic wand or anything.  I had grown up believing what I now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  Some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  But even with that ultimately I might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  But hearing that no matter what I did, how much I loved her or any other thing that I was NEVER going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  Yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if I hadn't heard that I would never be the lover I think I might have been okay.  Well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  Yes I overvalue sex.  I get that.  Yes it is very important to me and well frankly I want to be wanted as much as I want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  Yes I know whoever I date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  But I would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later. "

&#x200B;

Wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  As expected I received a ton of different opinions, and I thank you all.  However some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  Specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  It helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200B;

I had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that I had found and that bothered me.   
 I told her I just wanted the truth, and that I wasn't angry.  She explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that F took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  She was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  She was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  When F finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  She had told F to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  She also pointed out that once F left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  They went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  There were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with F was available).

&#x200B;

I know some of you wanted me to talk to F.  But I have no desire to, and I definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  There was plenty of texts from F to W lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  He lied to her saying I was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told W countless times she never had a chance with me.  W had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200B;

My wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion I'm sticking by her side.  We discussed our other relationship issues too.  Like I said, we had been struggling recently.  But the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  Not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  She told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  She was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  She wasn't mad that I looked through her messages, she even said I'm welcome to look.  But she promised she has nothing to hide.  Whether you agree or disagree with me, I married this woman for a reason.  And while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, I believe we are on the right path.

Edit : thanks for the kind words. I will block Mindy from social media for now. As to further steps I have to talk to my husband. 

And yes I know that this story sounds like the movie, I watched that yesterday. Difference is that the stepmother seemed like a decent person, which is not my case unfortunately 

---------------------------------------------------

I know this reads as a shit post but I really am desperate for help so please.

I have been married to my husband James for nearly 3 years now together for 7. We met at uni and have been going strong ever since.

James dad, Erik, divorced his ex wife 4 years ago. He then met his now wife Mindy and married her very quickly. It was a whole drama at our wedding because Erik brought Mindy and they were being really mean to James mom, Sarah (who is the greatest MIL in the world).

After that James distanced himself a bit from Erik. They got back into regular contact a year ago. We usually have lunch at their place once a moth or so. And it has been going great. We can't get past that Erik's wife is younger than us, but we try to ignore it.

A few months ago we found out we were pregnant. It was not planed but we are very happy non the less. We broke the news tow every one in person. We didn't do cheesy gifts or anything.

So then came the lunch at Erik's place and we told him. And without even congratulating us he told us ""Mindy is pregnant too!!!"".

Since then Erik and Mindy go out of their way to ""outshine"" my pregnancy. It is really stupid but I feel like I am in some kinda race? For example you know how you can get either a Standart ultrasound or one of those 4d ones? I posted my Standart one on isntagram and 4 minutes after that Mindy posts hers that is one of the fancy ones and she tags (!!!) me. She basically said this ""this is more expensive but so worth it to see the little one in detail! @op I recommend to get this one the next time 😉""

It irked me so much and idk why! It's just a stupid posts.

But what took the cake that she put her baby shower date on the same date as mine. She knew when I was having it because she asked me. She made it a whole Facebook event. Erik is very affluent so they are going all out. I am talking a hired band, fancy virgin cocktails with a barista, a whole ass venue etc.

Ofcourse James family is torn because while I invited them first they also want to go to mindies party and support Erik.

James now wants to cancel the baby shower all together. He is really bitter. Specially because he feels like this baby is a do over child for his father as Erik is now more involved than he was with James. Instead of enjoying what should be our wonderful journey to parenthood, James is always fuming and bitter about his father. And that leads to me, a pregnant and hormonal insecure woman, to be in a constant state of stress. I cry almost everyday and I can't enjoy this pregnancy. The pregnancy alone is very difficult as I have high blood pressure, backnee, nausea, and everytime I sneeze I feel like I peed my pants. I just need help or even just some encouragement. Thanks so much."

During the first year of uni, he has asked me out and I declined. During the years, I have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. I guess, in total, I had to decline him about 10 times or so.

However, during last summer I had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how I am). We have talked a little, and that's all. Soon after I had stumbled upon him near my house. I confronted him again, he denied following me. After that I told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

It all has been silent until last month. Two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if I have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. She didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. He did not reply.

Today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

I lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. He denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. I have ranted and once again blocked him.

However, I do not believe this is the end. I am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. I mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

He never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

What am I to do?

\---

Update 10/07: I would like to thank everyone for your replies. A lot of helpful advice was given, I really appreciate it. The situation doesn't seem so unmanageable as before.

Also, to those wondering why am I 22 after 6 years of university - well, that's how educational system in Russia works, my friends.

Thank you and stay safe, everyone!"

My 5 year wedding anniversary with my husband was last week. The traditional gift for 5 years is silverware. I wanted a new set and told my husband which he could get me as a gift. I knew he wanted an Apple Watch and bought that as my gift to him. 

On the day of our anniversary, I logged on to Reddit to find dozens of my posts and comments gilded. I found it odd as I don’t post terribly often and the guilded comments were old. It’s also the first time I’ve received reddit gold. 

When the time came to exchange gifts, he gleefully opened his Apple Watch and began setting it up. I figured I’m all the excitement he forgot to give me my gift so I gently prodded him. He told me to check reddit. 

Ladies and gentlemen, my husband GILDED me 24 times as an anniversary gift. He’s a bit of a jokester, so I figured my real gift was coming. 

But Reddit, it’s been a week. Do I say something? Buy the silverware myself? Some combination of the two? I feel if I don’t say something then the cycle will repeat itself."

I didn’t expect this much support, and I couldn’t really bring myself to post more about it.

I mustered the courage to go and talk to them, and had my girlfriend open her phone. Long story short, this has been going on for a while, and I guess my mom either didn’t know or doesn’t care. Lots of heart emojis. My girlfriend apologised and said she thought it’d be too awkward to tell me, but she felt bad for my dad, while my dad said he was embarrassed about getting old and having foot pains. I told him she isn’t a masseuse, as well as some more colorful words.

He tried to discuss “comfort levels” and boundaries, but I told him the fact that they did this in secret means they already know boundaries were broken. We got into a mild physical altercation, and now I’ve decided to move out. I’ve already contacted a friend.

I don’t know if it progressed farther than that for sure, but the trust is gone. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to speak to any of them again.

\--------------------------------

My girlfriend and I have been dating for one year. Since we’ve both been struggling financially, and she has a tense relationship with her family, she’s been living with me at home with my parents for the past two months. Everything’s been going well, and she’s made a point to help around the house wherever she can.

Usually, she gets up at 6 AM to do the cleaning in relative silence. This morning, she woke me up as she left the room, but I didn’t think much of it. My mouth felt dry, so I decided to head to the kitchen to get a glass of water. In the hall, I noticed the door to the guest room was open, which was weird because my girlfriend usually doesn’t clean that room. I opened it, and saw my father laying on a chair by the bed with his feet up, and my girlfriend was sitting in front of him with her hands wrapped around one of the feet. They were both fully clothed. They both looked at me, I looked back, and I just quietly head back to my room, locking the door behind me.

I heard my girlfriend knocking on the door and telling me it was just a foot massage, and it’s not what I think, but I just ignored her. I heard my dad knocking too, calling me immature, and then my mother begging me to come out for food at least. I tried to check her phone for any suspicious text messages, but it’s locked.

I haven’t left my room all day. I don’t know what I’m supposed to feel. Am I seriously just overreacting? How can I handle this? Please don’t mention the fucking Pulp Fiction scene, I don’t care."

Sorry. My (30f) husband, Luke (33m), had a sister, Laura (29f). We were all close and saw each other 2-3 times a month, along with their parents. Almost 6 months ago, Laura fell down the stairs at their family home and died. It was a freak accident, there's a window on the half landing and she hit her head on the sill. 

I was the last person to see her. I was there for less than 10 minutes and she was in her pyjamas making coffee. I didn't even stay for a drink, and I struggle with how such a brief and meaningless interaction could have been her last. She deserved so much more. 

My husband and I have only been married for a year but we've been together for 4 and have known each other for 20+. When Laura's parents found her they called my husband straight away and we rushed over. We faced the whole thing as a family. In the days after, Luke started quizzing me. Exactly what we talked about, what she was wearing, where we were standing etc. It progressed to saying I was providing conflicting information (on tiny details he was deliberately misunderstanding) and accusing me of withholding information because I couldn't tell him things like what pyjamas she was wearing. This escalated quickly but lasted for less than a week, as I lost my cool and made it clear that I was done answering questions. He didn't bring it up again and I wrote it off as a grief quirk. His behaviour was generally that of a normal, grieving person. 

Last Friday, he outright accused me of murdering her, in front of his parents. Out of the blue. We were all stunned. There was an inquest which recently concluded, and there was never any doubt the verdict would be accidental death. He said it was completely obvious and he couldn't believe that no one else could see it. He claims I went through his phone and found his messages with Laura (I have absolutely no idea what messages he's talking about, I have never looked at his phone) and that I went over to confront her and things ""got out of hand"" and I pushed her downstairs. By the end he was shouting about going to the police and getting the inquest overturned, and how I wasn't going to get away with it. Let me be clear - Laura and I had a great relationship. We all did. I have no idea where this has come from, other than these messages I haven't seen, and even then, I don't think there's anything I could ever see on someone's phone that would drive me to murder. It's just ridiculous. 

He's been with his parents since this happened and will not talk to me at all. I've had some contact with his mum but she's not being very communicative. The last I heard, she didn't know what messages he was referring to either. 

I am still completely stunned and I have no idea how to proceed. I made a commitment to be there for him always, and I understand that grief can manifest in strange ways, but part of me feels like my love for him died the second he called me a murderer and I don't know how we could possibly work through this. I also really don't want to be thought of in this way and I have no idea if he has said anything to people we know. I obviously haven't. 

A brain tumour or psychotic break has crossed my mind and I suggested it to his mother, and she just said she'll talk to him. Other than the questions before, he hasn't been acting odd. Obviously he's been grieving, but he's seemed sane and sensible other than this. I feel like I'm going mad, does anyone have any advice at all? 

Tl;Dr - My husband's sister died in a horrible accident, and my husband, for absolutely no reason other than some mystery messages, thinks I murdered her. 

Edit: it has come to my attention that I accidentally used ""Laura's"" real name once in this post. Can I kindly ask that anyone who commented ""Who is (realname)?"" delete their comment as I really don't want this to bleed into my real life. For obvious reasons. "

Wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. I've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during Xmas. 

I don't mind her being generous to friends and family. It brings her joy and I appreciate that. But what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. Every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of Christmas decorations. Everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. Every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

To best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. She will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. Then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. Then she'll see one at Walmart which features lighting McQueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. So we'll have 10 new stockings for Xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on January 2nd. The rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. Replace stockings with any other Xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

Last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about April on her xmas purchases. I told her enough was enough and frankly I'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. We went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. She agreed.

However I was getting ready for work (I work extra Saturday shifts in Novmeber and December to afford the holidays, another post I guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new Xmas decorations hidden in the garage. I would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. I'm so disgusted I can hardly see straight. 

I'm up at 4:30 on a Saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. I feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

What do I do here? Sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here. 


edit: my meter is a little off but this asshole is trying to troll me right?

Let's see... HER problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. HEY! YOU live there too. YOU get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for YOUR friends and YOUR family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? You bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. But you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. Hey, I've got an idea, Mr. Man. GET ON YOUR TINY SNOWFLAKE FEET AND PUT THE FUCKING DECORATIONS AWAY. Then there they are, next year. Her? She's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. Or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle."

I’m on a throwaway account 
I’ve known my sister’s (31F) husband my entire life. Literally, he was at the hospital the day I was born. I’ve always considered him to be more of a father than my actual father, he’s always been there for me when I needed someone most and given me advice whenever I needed it. It wasn’t till a couple years ago his behavior changed slightly. When I first started wearing bras, and he still does this now, he unclips the clasps regardless of where we are, in public, at home, etc. He comments on my breasts constantly regarding the size, if they look bigger or smaller, whenever I see him. Recently he found out through my sister that I’m having sex. He’s always asking about my sex life and telling me about how his sex life is disappointing with my sister. He recently had a vasectomy and told me in detail what his penis looked like. Another thing he does is guilt trip me because I don’t call him or talk to him often enough. I try to explain to him that I don’t have the time to call everyday and he tells me “it’s because I’m not important enough,” After my 16th birthday is when he started saying “only a couple years before you turn 18,” I know for a fact that if my sister heard some of the conversations he has with me she’d be very uncomfortable. What should I do?

Hi all!

Wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than I expected. First of all, I want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. It means a lot.

Now, onto the update.

For Easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a BBQ at her sister’s. Not wanting her family to see any tension, I saw this as a chance for her to HAVE to speak to me. As we’re getting ready for church, I tell her that we need to talk about everything now. She agreed and sat down with me.

I did tell her that there is absolutely no way we’re naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). She agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

Also, I know a lot of you suggested that I get a paternity test. I know that I’m 100% the father. I didn’t want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. I thought it out, but, I still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. She adamantly said no. She had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. She tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn’t in love with him anymore. She described him as not being a good person at all.

She apologized for making me feel that way.

I told her that I understand she’s going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn’t help at all. But, I had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

She started to get choked up and was shaking. I told her that she could tell me. 

She confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. Also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn’t his first choice.

She also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. She wasn’t expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn’t want it too. She talked about how she thought we’d travel and that she’d continue racing her motorcycle. Now, she’s not even sure if she’d be able to ride again. She actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex’s death reminded her how much of a risk it is. She doesn’t want to risk her life when she has a family. She feels gutted. 

Regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn’t change a thing about her life now and that she’s happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. We’re the best things that has ever happened to her.

Anxiety also runs in my wife’s family. My wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. It’s so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

After discussing things, she decided that she’ll be going into therapy.  She has her first appointment this week.

TLDR: Wife feels guilty about ex’s death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he’d fall off his bike and die. She keeps thinking about how he died. Wife also said that she’s happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there’s a lot going on and it’s a lot. She’s sad that she probably can’t ride motorcycles anymore. Wife will go into therapy this week."

EDIT 2: Thanks for all your comments again. The comments seem to be going 1 of 3 ways: 1. It's horrible that he forgot 2. I need to grow up OR 3. It's reconcilable if the relationship is OK.

The relationship is ok, kind of. We've had our struggles. We argue sometimes. But for the most part he is alright.  We're fine together. Very normal.  I'm going to have to mull everything over.

EDIT 3: Thanks for all your comments, birthday wishes, etc in private messages and in the comments. I haven't talked to him today, he knows he upset me and he sent me a ""I'm sorry about yesterday"" message.  Some of you make a lot of good points, especially the person that said that I shouldn't use him to make up for whatever happened in my past.. which is pretty true. But all in all, he knew that it was important. I just wanted a Happy Birthday. Everyone in my life wished me a Happy Birthday except my boyfriend. I'm no longer going to update this. Thanks everyone <3 "

I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. It wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. It's home. Now that I'm at a huge university in my city, I've met people from all types of backgrounds. Of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. He's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. But I was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. We really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200B;

In my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/GPA. That applies from elementary school and until the end of College. College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount. Finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. The good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

It's like, in my HOOD hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. I think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. It's super lowkey.

I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. He never seemed scared or judgemental. When we walked in, I was getting out my school ID. I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. He laughed. I asked him what was so funny.

He said ""They shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

He says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. I told him that IS where I live. It's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

This started a huge argument.

I asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. I have 3. They were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. It's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. My mom goes to a new funeral every week. Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now. My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. That there's ""nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". And that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". That this is why people get dependant on welfare.

At this point I told him I was done. I didn't want to debate, I didn't want to talk him. Not then, not ever again. We just went out separate ways. I broke up with him as soon as I got home.

He thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. That we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. I told him, yes the fuck we are. He's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  I think I may have overreacted with the block, but I want him to leave me alone. I don't want to work it out.

All my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

I'm not saying I HAVE to be with someone who's from my hood. But I have to be with someone who at least gets it. Especially when ""it"" has shaped who I am today. Idk what kind of person I am, but I think I might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. That ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

Edit: I'm sorry I wasn't clear. Should I let him reach out to me? I don't want to get back together, but should I unblock him and talk it out. I'm worried that I'll fold and we might get back together. I've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. I'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **I didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. But our core values don't align. What he said and did disgusted me. In the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

Edit: Guys I did not make it out the hood at 19, I still live there lmao. I'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day I can get my whole family out.

And had some drinks. His mood turned toward the end of the evening and seemed grumpy. I kept asking why he was mad at me and he wouldn’t tell me. He kept calling me a bitch and pulled my hair while I was walking in front of him to the car. On the way home he wouldn’t say one word to me. When we got inside his apartment I said “please talk to me. Why are you made at me? I’m sorry. Please don’t be angry.” He just snapped and pushed me to the couch and started choking me. I was so shocked. He stared right in my eyes while he did it. I couldn’t think of what to do so I slapped him. I just wanted him to let me breathe. Then he slapped me back and started choking me again. I didn’t pass out but my vision was going black. He got off me and left the room. I grabbed my stuff and ran, going to my house. The next day he didn’t apologize he said “I didn’t want to hurt you but you were acting up last night. I love you, but you brought that side out of me.” ....... I don’t know what I should do?! I’m so confused. He has never done this before. Maybe he was just really drunk. "
i3il7r,Boyfriend (18M) is upset that my (18F) brother (26M) didn’t let him spend the night with me when I was very drunk and passed out.,10429,0.99,1143,2020-08-04 18:10:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3il7r/boyfriend_18m_is_upset_that_my_18f_brother_26m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i3il7r/boyfriend_18m_is_upset_that_my_18f_brother_26m/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I’ve just turned 18 and can now legally drink where we live. So my brother invited me, my new boyfriend and a few friends and cousins over to hang out and maybe get drunk.

I drank way more than I should have. People left one by one and I was only there with my brother and boyfriend, I don’t remember much except that I woke up in his spare bedroom in the morning and my boyfriend wasn’t there.

Apparently I passed out on the couch, brother took me to the bedroom to sleep, boyfriend wanted to spend the night there but my brother said no.

My brother says he didn’t let him stay because he doesn’t know him and he didn’t know if we’ve been intimate, and I was completely incapacitated and couldn’t consent to sex or anything intimate. So he felt like it’s safer to not allow him spend the night there with me.

Boyfriend insisted that he didn’t want to have sex, just cuddling. He got confrontational with my brother and accused him of being controlling and said he has no right to decide if he can spend the night with me, which my brother told him “I can decide you’re not gonna spend another minute in my house”, boyfriend said he’ll leave but he’ll take me with him. Brother stood in his way and told him to either leave or deal with the police. Boyfriend left.

So here we are. My brother thinks I’m dating a complete idiot and asshole, my boyfriend thinks I have an asshole controlling brother and I’ve spent the last two days regretting drinking that much.

My own feeling is that it would have been okay if my boyfriend spent the night with me in the bed, but absolutely not okay to have sex (we haven’t had sex yet, dating for less than a month). I understand why my brother acted in a protective way, I was drunk and letting a guy who is interested in me sexually spend the night with me is just unnecessary risk.

I also understand my boyfriend’s disappointment, but he should have respected my brother in his own house.

So now my boyfriend has demanded an apology from my brother for being mistrusted and for interfering in his relationship, and my brother had banned him from future events and parties at his place for being an asshole. My boyfriend would also like me to demand an apology on my own behalf from my brother for him acting the way he did, by assuming he can decide who I can or can’t spend the night with. 

I’m in this mess, and I need to make this disappear if I am to have some peace and make everything normal again with my relationship and family.

What do I say to my boyfriend? I think he needs to drop this and move on, and over time show to my family that his behaviour on the night wasn’t who he really is, to earn their trust. 

TLDR: Brother didn’t let my boyfriend spend the night with me at his house when I was very drunk and incapacitated. They got confrontational and it ended up with my boyfriend being kicked out of the house. Boyfriend now demands an apology and I need a way to get him to drop it and move on."

First of all, I would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so I am very grateful. 

I have received some pretty messed up private messages, and I wanted to let you guys know because I don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: Date Rapist Here: Hey I just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. I knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(I can provide screenshots if necessary) 

As for how it unfolded: I gave my boyfriend my phone to text S if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. He made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that I was very upset about what had happened, that I needed an explanation and that I was telling my bf everything. His answer was ""How could you not know I have always liked you? I thought you liked me too."" ""I am sorry I went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""Anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" Needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. He then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, I saw you put something in it."" He then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

My boyfriend called him and told him that I had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. He also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. I don't know what is going to come of that. 

Honestly, I just don't want to see him again now. The police has my report and I hope he never tries that again but I can't do much more. 

Thank you again for the support."

I love her so much. We finally got our own place on December 2018 and things were looking up for us. These 5 years were so magical and I always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that I would marry her again.

This past Tuesday, my lead told us that we can VTO  (Volunteer Time Off. I work night shift) So my co worker gave me a ride home. (My wife and I share a car). When he dropped me off, I noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. I thought that she parked somewhere else.

As soon as I went inside, I went to our bedroom so that I can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that I am home. The plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

She wasn't in the room. She wasn't home. So I called her and asked her where she was. When she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

My heart broke because I had a feeling of what was going on. She made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. I gave her the benefit of the doubt.

So I was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. She sat on the bed and I asked her if she was okay. She wouldn't answer and began to cry. Then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. She said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

I am sad. I honestly thought this would never happen to me. I don't know what to do. We had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. We agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, I am strongly considering in divorcing her. I can't even look at her anymore. The thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. She wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

What should I do? Am I overreacting?  I honestly thought of killing myself. I am so sad. She was my everything.

TLDR;   Wife confessed to cheating. I am so sad. Thinking of killing myself.  What do I do?

&#x200B;

Thank you

&#x200B;

Edit to say: Just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) I am so surprised for the support! <3

Thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. I still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  I forgive her. Time will heal this pain and honestly, I love her too much to end this.  We have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. I honestly can't imagine being with another person.  She is truly sorry that she cheated on me. Most wont agree with this, but I will give her another chance and see where this goes.

And no, I wont kill myself. I promise.  I really appreciate your concerns and replies. It makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. Take care everyone and I'll update as time goes on.. <3

&#x200B;

\*\*\*UPDATE 09/13:\*\*\*

I have been reading the comments. I understand that to most it is stupid that I am still with her. I understand. Trust me. We have been talking a lot. She is truly sorry and I forgive her. I put her mistake behind me and I am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  We plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. The reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (We will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200B;

We are working this out. We are still living together. We are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. Honestly, it has been going well. Things are looking up because soon, I will be transferring to Day shift so that I can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that I have been longing for. I still want her in my life and I don't see divorce. We will work this out.

Again, Thank you all for helping me in my time of need. I am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. It helps. Ill update as time goes on. <3"
bek7qo,"I [17/M] glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend [17/F] going though all her messages, and I saw hearts and ""I love you"" to her best guy friend.",10343,0.92,1410,2019-04-18 16:34:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bek7qo/i_17m_glanced_over_my_shoulder_at_my_girlfriend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bek7qo/i_17m_glanced_over_my_shoulder_at_my_girlfriend/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Is it normal, or am I just overanalyzing things. She text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. Here's the kicker though. He calls her cutie. He's told me in person that he's interested in her. He calls her cutie over text. Now, obviously I can't just outright tell her anything, Because then she'll know I caught a glance. She said I love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so I guess it's normal. I'm just trying to get some other opinions.

Edit One: Wow, thanks everyone, seriously. I talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. She was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. I told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. She agreed with me, I think. I told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""I love you"" thing. She has some extracurriculars, so I won't hear from her until around 4:45. Thanks everyone, so much. I'll let you all know what went down.

Edit Two: Nothing yet from her, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. If I don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

Edit Three: So, being 17, I have a momma to talk to. So, that's exactly what I did. I went driving with her, I've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and I both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. However, come Monday, I will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. Obviously, I won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. Thank you all for the continual support, I love you all.

Edit Four: Alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. He called me, and apologized. He didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. He said ""It may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. The girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. Thank you all, even the ""You're 17 shut up fag"" comments. I love you all unconditionally. Night y'all."
1e3a0sq,"Update: My (30f) husband (33m) accused me of murder, out of the blue. How do I salvage this?",10334,0.98,439,2024-07-15 00:27:35,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e3a0sq/update_my_30f_husband_33m_accused_me_of_murder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e3a0sq/update_my_30f_husband_33m_accused_me_of_murder/,self.relationship_advice,0,7,,text,False,,False,"Firstly, thank you to those who helped me get to my husband's icloud backups through an old iPad. I wasn't expecting much from reddit, but I got valuable practical advice before my post was locked, and I appreciate it. 

There were no crazy, or even suspicious messages. I've searched for over 100 terms and scrolled back over years. I saw a side of them both I wasn't expecting, but nothing that explains the claim I murdered Laura over their chats. Nothing to suggest he was cheating. Absolutely nothing to suggest incest. I repeat: NO INCEST. No weird gaps where deleted conversations or a switch to another app would fit. Just siblings making plans, sending memes, and gossiping. They said unexpectedly horrible stuff about a few people, but not me. It was a sort of relief but it raised more questions than it answered.

I sought legal advice, also from reddit, after posting here. Turns out my options are divorce him or sit down. I contacted my community mental health team, who said they'd reach out, but made it clear it wasn't urgent. I then called his mum and said that if I didn't hear from him by this weekend, I would get a solicitor and ask for a mental heath assessment as part of the divorce. In response, he made a ridiculous post to Facebook (which neither of us have used in years) and everything blew up. I'm going to try to keep this succinct. 

On Friday night, he made a long accusation on Facebook, with new information. He said he'd been planning to leave me for months with his sister's support, and I found the messages, and murdered her. The coroner has reopened the case and the police are preparing to arrest me, and he needs to make sure people know before the trial stops him talking about it. It was well written and seemed vaguely plausable. 

He messaged people links so it got some attention - we live in our hometown, and have a large circle of friends because we've been here all our lives. People I haven't spoken to since school were reaching out to me asking wtf was going on. It was madness.

In response, I posted the export of his entire conversation history with Laura, also to Facebook (when I finally got back in). I linked to the chat along with a post explaining my side, and noting that I had changed my ex's icloud and apple passwords, and that if he wanted them back, he should comment on my post and update his own, admitting that he was lying. He eventually did. 

When I started getting messages about his post, I panicked, and changing his passwords seemed important to preserve everything because he'd know I had access. When I spoke to him the next morning it's clear he's not having a mental episode at all, but is claiming one because he's been caught in a big lie. As soon as he was outed, he called me, clearly drunk, begging and promising to explain everything if I deleted my post. I hung up and told him to call back the next day. He did (after many missed calls and texts), and he tried to bargain and guilt trip me with his mental health until it was clear the wrong people had seen his conversation. It's hard to describe but it seemed fake. It was too well rehearsed, and then this morning, when it was clear he was getting nowhere, he blocked me. 

Begging for mercy and reciting facts about mental disorders doesn't align with someone in crisis with a sincere belief that someone murdered their sibling. The question of why he did all this remains unanswered, and he will not be getting his passwords until it is. The legal advice subreddit said this stuff is technically illegal but it's beneath a court to take action, so I'm going to count on that because I felt like I had no other choice at the time, and now I don't see any other way to get answers from him. I am desperate and it's all I've got. 

So there we are. The relationship I have believed was my destiny since I was a teenager has boiled down to petty, convoluted and vindictive bullshit, played out on social media, for reasons still unknown. My hope for a brain tumour is fading and clearly tomorrow morning is going to be when I lawyer up and stop posting about this. I am mortified, I have no idea whether some people might believe him, and I still don't know why this all happened in the first place. Sorry I don't have a happier update, and thanks once again to everyone who offered advice.

Thank you all for the advice, but I decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and I'll be standing my ground.

I've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying I'm a crazy teen and I'll regret it. But grandpa made a point that I need to stop trying to decide how I'll feel in the future. Cause truth is you can never know. You have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. Not based on feelings and info you MIGHT have later.

Right now, I´m disgusted by dad and brother. I want nothing to do with them. I don't trust them. And I even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

If my feelings change, I will deal with that when they do. Cross the bridge when I get to it and all.

I wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause I don't see the point. My story is kindda over.

But something happened yesterday and I wanted to share.

So I decided to stand by my ""fuck no, I don't wanna talk to them"". I'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. Grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, I asked him not to share and I know he wont. He is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. He called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

So mom showed up at his place (I've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can DECIDE whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. LOOOOL so mom goes INSANE, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, I'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". It goes on for a while until mom says I'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. He looks at me and says I'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

I was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, I broke. Mom left after a while and I just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, I'm your family, family doesn't leave. You remember that when you have one of your own"", and I fucking will.

&#x200B;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. I'm good. Grandpa is the shit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit - o, before I forget. Some people were asking about what my siblings were like. Well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships I had with friends, family, even a girlfriend I cared about). He was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. Mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. Grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. I guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, I'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200B;

another edit - I read the comment section to grandpa, I had to explain what OG is and he now wants to watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. Reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. But he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". The comment comparing him to Clint Eastwood made his day! Thanks for the love guys"
hozmr6,Update: Daughter molested by my dad,10300,0.97,720,2020-07-11 04:58:45,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hozmr6/update_daughter_molested_by_my_dad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hozmr6/update_daughter_molested_by_my_dad/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Update to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hluo3o/found_out_my_daughter_12_may_have_been_abused_by/).

What a fucking week. I'm just....exhausted and it's not even near being over.

I'll try to keep this short. But it's a hot mess. CPS was contacted by me. They in turn contacted the police. I had a meeting with a detective the next day who sat down and took a statement from me. He insisted that my daughter speak to someone at a specialized 'house' for children in these situations before she saw a therapist. I agreed and we got her set up for the next day. This location would record the interviews for investigation purposes but didn't hide that from the children. I won't go into too many details but it was very hard on my daughter and she had to end the interview early because she was so upset. I found out some details about what happened. What she told them was bad but it could have been worse. But they felt she wasn't telling them everything. I feel the same as some of the things she mentioned to me weren't mentioned at all to them. Further conversation with my daughter revealed she felt they were pushing her too hard and so she shut down.

The next day the detective went to speak to my dad about the accusations. About two hours worth of talking and he finally confessed to what she said he did. There was no arrest at the time. Shortly after I get multiple phone calls from my mother, none of which I answered. I spoke to her via text and basically she's siding with my dad. First she reassured me that my dad wasn't mad with either of us, and that it 'wasn't that bad', and that 'it was completely innocent and she just mistook what happened'. She told me that my dad had explained to her what 'really' happened and the detective was just out to get him. Then she went on about how they were going to have to move and how she couldn't show her face around their social events anymore. That she and him would do everything they could to 'help' my daughter. I told her my daughter's not seeing him anymore and apparently that was a terrible thing for me to say. She hasn't spoken to me since.

I have the support of one brother and sister in law but circumstances have changed so that they have to move out of state temporarily because of this. My mother had chosen to lash out at them as being at fault for this coming to light since they were the ones who told me about it after my daughter confided in them. My other brother hasn't even contacted me and has only been in touch with my parents so I can only assume he's siding with them. There's also a very good chance my father is getting arrested on Monday.

But I'm a mess. I'm getting SO much pressure from my family that this was a misunderstanding. And I want SO badly for that to be true. Half of my brain is telling me that maybe they're right, maybe I've been overreacting over nothing. The other half of my brain is telling me that whatever it was that DID happen has completely messed up my child. She was an absolute wreck leaving the interview. I just want to stress though, as much as I'm struggling, as HARD as this is for me mentally and emotionally, I'm doing nothing to hinder the investigation and making no hint of my own internal debate to my daughter. I've told her I'm behind her 100% and I mean it.

I just....I have no-one around me to support me, to back me up. All of my support is online and while appreciated I really just...need someone to stand next to me and say ""She's right and this is wrong"". I'm struggling to go through this alone and handle my own emotions while maintaining a strong face for my daughter. I have to return to work soon and my daughter will be staying at home alone while I do and terrified her grampa will come over while I'm at work. But I have no one. Absolutely no one. My parents were my rock, my support on every part of my life and they're gone from me now.

I know this is more venting than asking for advice, as there is very little that anyone outside can do but....I really just needed to write it out. If there is any advice, please give it. I'm trying to get through this in whatever way I can....Thanks to anyone who read this far.

**Edit**: Thank you so much everyone who's offering me support. It has made me feel so much better. I've gone from just a feeling of overwhelming dread and despair over everything that's happened and will happened, to feeling calmer and more confident in what I'm doing. I'm still worried, and I don't think I can completely get rid of that, but the support from everyone has helped so much.

At the suggestion of others, I ordered a camera for the front door. I don't think they have a key for the front door so that should be fine. I should also mention I've seen a HUGE change in my daughter's behavior since this came to light. She's happier, more open to talking to me and just a different girl. She's expressed multiple times about how relieved she is to have told someone and explained that many of the things she's done in the past (cutting her hair, wearing baggy clothes) were done in attempts to keep her grampa from noticing her. I still think there's things that she hasn't told anyone about what happened but I feel like with time it will come out. She really likes the therapist she met with today so fingers crossed.

Again. **Thank you**. Everyone. I've been feeling so alone that this has helped me more than you'll know.

**Edit 2**: Good lord, I went to bed and woke up to an explosion of support! I'm working on reading through every comment and trying to reply where I can. Please, if I don't respond to your comment it's not that I didn't read it or appreciate it. I'm just....wow. Thank you thank you THANK YOU to everyone. I can't express how much this means to me. You all are truly amazing <3"
dytnju,How can I (29F) support my brother (36M) who has a horrible child (10M) that's ruining his life?,10301,0.95,1238,2019-11-20 05:55:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dytnju/how_can_i_29f_support_my_brother_36m_who_has_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dytnju/how_can_i_29f_support_my_brother_36m_who_has_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"Here's everyone involved:

Me, 29F

My husband, 29M

Our daughter is 5 months old

My brother 36M

His wife 34F

Their kids, 10M in the title, and 6F

A few months ago my brother and his family came to visit us. It had been a very busy and exhausting few weeks since I'd had my daughter like anyone with a newborn will know. I was feeling well enough to see them and let them properly meet her.

We were in the backyard eating lunch. My niece found a furry brown caterpillar in the bushes. The kids were told not to touch it because it could be poisonous. Around 20-30 mins later, my daughter starts screaming. Right as I looked and started going over to her I see my nephew stepping away from her bounce seat. I instantly knew he'd done something. There were red blotches all over her neck and cheek. When I picked her up, the caterpillar was there on the seat where her head had been. 

In total panic my husband and I rushed to the ER. My brother and his family stayed at the house. By the time we got there the whole side of her face had swelled up and she was shrieking nonstop. Doctor diagnosed pretty quickly, there were caterpillar spines lodged under her skin like we'd assumed. 

My nephew must have broken off the twig with the caterpillar (he hadn't been stung) then as soon as no one was looking while my daughter was asleep, he rubbed it on her face. 

I called my brother from the hospital, he confronted my nephew who eventually claimed he just ""accidentally dropped it"". He had no remorse as usual.

My husband and I had to be interviewed by a child welfare worker. She talked to my brother who drove over to explain what had happened. It was a very long ordeal, I didn't blame her or the hospital people for doing their job at all and in the end my husband and I weren't at fault for doing anything wrong, but it was very exhausting to deal with. 

This was the absolute last straw for us. I was furious with this child. Enraged doesn't even begin to describe it. I was/am also frankly terrified for my brother's family even though I know how stupid that must sound.

That weekend my husband and I had a long conversation with my brother and his wife on videochat after they'd gotten home. They are well aware something is very wrong with their son. They don't downplay his behavior at all. He scares them. When they punish him, he doesn't care. He doesn't react to any criticism, yelling, or logical argument, but he'll find a way to get revenge even if it's weeks later. He also doesn't care about rewards for good behavior. There's very little he openly cares about that they can use as leverage, and he seems to outright prefer doing destructive things more than anything they might take away or try to bribe him with.

He's arranged tacks sitting upright on the floor outside their door that my brother's wife stepped on. 

He's pooped on their bed and once left poop and urine in every drawer of their clothes. 

He floods the bathroom by letting the tub overflow and leaves the gas stove on. He'll use the stove to play with fire when no one's around, and several times has set off the smoke detector in the middle of the night.

They were all getting sick except him at one point and my SIL caught him mixing cleaner fluid into some leftover soup. 

He has done countless things to hurt and scare his younger sister like cutting off her hair while sleeping, putting chili pepper powder in her underwear, telling her someone is coming to kidnap her or kill their parents, and once caught a garden snake that he dropped in the tub while she was having a bubble bath. Those are just the ones that first jump to mind.

He also is cruel to animals. Pulls wings off insects, cuts up worms, thinks it's funny to scare cats and dogs. They had a couple hamsters, one mysteriously died and the other they thought had escaped until it was found in a box under his bed with no legs.
 
He tries to blame things he does on his sister including the caterpillar but my brother knows what's going on. Doesn't stop him from constantly lying to anyone and everyone. 

They do not know what to do. He's apparently very well-behaved at school, so his teachers have never seen any of this. There have been a couple times when he injured himself on purpose and then told a teacher he was being hit at home. Resulted in a CPS investigation both times. It was also conveniently right before parent-teacher conference week. My brother and his wife were never able to bring up their concerns or have a good rapport with those teachers then because they clearly believed they were child abusers. 

They've brought him to several child psychologists but he lies to them, either acting perfectly normal or telling them the same stories about how his parents are crazy or abusive, so they can't take him to anyone now in case they get investigated again. They're terrified that one day an accusation is going to stick and they'll lose their daughter, not to mention the legal consequences. 

I told them that as long as their son is hurting people, lying, and incapable of behaving, he cannot be in my daughter's presence. They have abided by this since then. 

The problem is, we miss seeing each other! They live a couple hours away and we used to visit a few times a year. They're already socially isolated because trying to manage their son takes so much of their time and energy. My SIL's family has also banned him from being around their children. He's been banned from other kids' houses and between that and the rumors that my brother and SIL are abusive, they've been slowly frozen out of their school community. They have a few childless friends still, but like I said they hardly have any ability to see them. They can't leave the kids with a babysitter because of things their son has done while being babysat in the past. It's beyond any stranger's ability to deal with especially the teenage girls they used to hire.

So now my husband and I have essentially cut them off too. I feel so guilty about this knowing how little social support they've already got. They both understood we have to protect our daughter, but it was clear they're near a breaking point. He's destroying their lives and they often don't feel safe in their own home.

I've seen them once since this went down while my husband stayed home with our baby, this was a couple nights ago. We ate dinner where their son was remarkably well behaved the whole time, then when we were saying goodbye he whispered ""I wish you'd brought (Baby), her screams are adorable."" I was too stunned to say anything and he just stood there with a shit eating smirk. My brother sounded totally defeated later when I mentioned it. They were just relieved he hadn't acted out during dinner.  

What on earth can we do to help? Has anyone ever known a kid like this and did you ever find any way to deal with them? This seems far beyond normal behavior problems, and nothing works.

TL;DR: I can't do visits with my brother's family anymore because his son is out of control and will try to hurt my infant daughter. This is not my brother and SIL's fault and my husband and I want to find some way to help them."
9rxx1t,My husband has sex with me while I sleep wth?,10241,0.87,2539,2018-10-28 02:59:04,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9rxx1t/my_husband_has_sex_with_me_while_i_sleep_wth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9rxx1t/my_husband_has_sex_with_me_while_i_sleep_wth/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. I know it sounds crazy! Im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. On a few occasions I've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows I'm waking up, he stops. I am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. I hate sleeping in clothes, I'm a naked sleeper but I don't think that is an open invitation right?

 Last weekend, I woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until I acted like I was still asleep, I wanted to see how far this was going to go.  I pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime I ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until I fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and I said.... was that good for you? HE TRIED TO ACT LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP!!! I told him I was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. His answer...I was horny, it wont happen again. 

Fast forward a week...I haven't been talking to him all week. I go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. I confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, I'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if I did that to him and when I asked why he stopped when I woke up he says because he knew I'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. I am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe I could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

At this point in feel like I can't trust  him anymore and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Do you think I should believe him? He is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though I've told him I've caught him before.

Thank you all for your comments and advice. I’m glad to know I wasn’t overthinking the situation.

I called Tori yesterday and gave her the opportunity to meet up, apologize and explain more in depth. She accepted my offer and we had lunch at a nearby restaurant today. Some of you guessed that the reason that she didn’t want me at her job was because she could’ve been hiding something. That was correct. 

She told me that she was indeed having an affair with a coworker. I didn’t buy it at all. It just didn’t make sense because if that was the case, why would she tell her husband that she sabotaged me rather than keep that to her self? Turns out that my husband was pressuring him for answers as well and her husband kept “reminding” her to ask her boss why I didn’t get the job. That’s when she told him what she did. She also gave him a completely different explanation of why she didn’t want me working there. She showed me months of steamy texts and sexts between her and her coworker so I knew then that she was telling the truth. 

I asked her why she didn’t just tell me? She said that she was scared that people at her job would ask me questions and it would come out that she’s married. The guy at her job that she’s been seeing doesn’t even know and thinks they are in an exclusive relationship. She said that if I found out about the affair, she was afraid that I’d tell my husband and since our husbands are best friends, he would tell hers. She gets together with her coworker for a few hours after work and on weekends. Apparently, she doesn’t even work weekends! Her husband thinks that she is at work all this time. She said that having me work there would ruin things as our schedules wouldn’t add up and it would get back to her husband and he would question her about why.

I asked her why would she have me apply and say that she would get me in knowing she had no intentions of having me work with her??? She said that she didn’t think I’d really take her up on her offer as I’ve made comments before about her work sounding boring and that she was really hoping that if she dragged it out long enough, I’d get tired of waiting and look elsewhere. 

The million dollar question that I asked her was: what did you say to your boss to change her mind about offering me the job? She said she told her boss that having me work there would honestly probably just be a distraction and she wouldn’t perform her best and that I was known to be lazy and a slacker. (Definitely not true) she DID offer her sincere apology and said that she felt terrible knowing what all Jon and I were going through and she didn’t help. But I just can’t see myself forgiving her or even trusting her again after this situation. 

Basically the best friend that I have known all these years has turned into a complete stranger! I feel like I don’t even know her anymore. This isn’t someone I want in my life. Especially after she caused me to look foolish by badmouthing me to her boss. I told her that our friendship was over and that she’d better have a talk with her husband because no way was I holding this back from mine. 

A few hours later, my husband got a call from hers. Tori told him the news and they are now separating and he will file for a divorce in the upcoming weeks. Tori is, believe it or not, moving in with her coworker. I haven’t heard from her since leaving the restaurant and honestly don’t plan on talking to her ever again. Almost 30 years of friendship gone over a string of lies. 

As for my husband, him and I had a long talk after revealing to me that he already knew what Tori did. I explained to him that it is NEVER okay to keep things like that from me, no matter what. I understand him and Matt have a very good friendship but me and my feelings should come first in future situations like this. He agreed and will eventually gain my trust back.

Edit: just to clear things up, my husband never knew about Tori’s affair. All he knew was that Tori sabotaged the job.
Also a lot of you are saying the coworker deserves to know and I agree. I emailed the HR department at her job and requested a meeting with the woman I had a phone interview with. The meeting is Friday and I will tell her then, about Tori’s lie and about the affair and I will let her handle it how she wants to from there. After this, I’m completely done with her.

Edit 2: a lot of you think that me talking to her boss is a bad idea. If anything, I probably won’t bring up the affair situation, but I do want to bring it to her attention that Tori lied to her. I don’t think her boss would appreciate having employees that would easily lie to their face to cover up shady stuff that they’ve been doing. I may just send her an email with that part of the recording attached and a quick explanation instead of going to meet her. And yes, I recorded our encounter. If I figure out how, I could possibly post it if anyone would be interested in hearing.

 I honestly don’t care if telling her boss is a fucked up thing to do. She didn’t give a fuck about me when she watched me struggle for months and prevented me from getting a job that I desperately needed AT THE TIME, so why should I give a fuck about her? She’s not my friend anymore anyway. She needs to learn that she can’t just do whatever she want with 0 consequences so stop telling me not to say anything."

It’s been 2 months since I posted about my situation on this sub and I just want to give you an update of how things went after I made that post. Before I go into the details, I just want to say I really appreciate everyone here. After I resolved everything, I occasionally would go back to my original post and read the comments to remind myself that I’ve done the right thing. 

After posting on here, I went home from work that day and asked my friends to come over but stay in the parking lot while I sort things out with my now ex bf. Before I could even start the conversation, he told me his friend got a new car recently and how I should get him a car since I can afford it. I got really upset and told him he could’ve got himself a car if he was working. I told him how stressful it has been for me with him not working and fully relying on me. He started the “my life is already miserable and you’re not being supportive” talk. I was sick of it. So I said I wanted to end things here and he needs to move out asap. As expected, he got upset and threw a tantrum. He was yelling, throwing stuff around, and when he realized I was being dead serious, he started threatening to hit and kill my dogs. I jumped in between him and the dogs to stop him from harming them. Then he pushed me, and grabbed me by my neck. I was able to get him off of me, put the dogs into a room, and called my friends to tell them come in and call the police. He was trying to hit me but my friends got there in time. I think he got scared when he saw my friends showed up, so he backed down but still verbally telling them to get out of the way or he would hit them too. The police came. They took him away and told me he wouldn’t be able to come into the apartment anymore. He had to move but would need to be escorted by the police if he wants to grab his stuff later. 

It was a horrible experience, but it showed me that I’ve done the right thing. I thought that was the end of everything. But his aunty called me when she found out, and tried to gaslight me saying that he didn’t do anything wrong and I was just upset so I called the police. I told myself that I no longer have to deal with these bullshit, so I told her to leave me alone and hung up. His family would continue to harass me but stopped when I threaten to report to the police. 

I continue to pay the rent and bills like how I’ve always been doing. The only thing that’ve changed is I’m now so much happier. I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in years. I just got a promotion last week. I’ve been spending time enjoying life (with the extra money I have since I no longer having to pay for his expenses). As for my ex, he’s moved in with his aunt. I got a protection order so we are not in contact at all."
cutt5q,[Update] My(27F) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31M). Everyone thinks I should break up with him but I don't want to.

Turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. They said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and I will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and I will no longer love him. I reassured him and made sure he understood I will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. Boyfriend and I agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. So that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, I feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. I've been told ""I told you so"" by my brother..

I have been putting off talking to his grandparents. But I will definitely talk to them before I let my son spend time with them again. I want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). I think I will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

Edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. Honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. Wasn't expecting it. I know many of you think that I should cut his grandparents off but I honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. Maybe he misunderstood. I will find out for sure when I speak to them. I am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes."

I(16f) have a newborn since I was shamed into keeping it and I breastfeed him.

My bf who I have been with for about 3 years called me on FaceTime yesterday when I was feeding and when he saw it he asked why I breastfeed when I can buy formula. I. Told him that it costs money and he seems to prefer my milk over formula.

Ever since then he has been sending me articles about the dangers of breastfeeding and a bunch of fake news stories of kids dying from it. I tell him to quit sending me them and he says that he wants me to quit since he is uncomfortable with me feeding. He hasn’t spoken to me since I told him I wasn’t quitting. What should I do

Edit:he is not the father

Edit so I don’t have to keep explaining:I didn’t cheat on him I got pregnant from when I got assaulted"
ios6r0,My (27/F) husband’s (29/M) assistant (31/F) sent him a text asking him when he was going to divorce me.,10158,0.96,1084,2020-09-08 17:24:28,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ios6r0/my_27f_husbands_29m_assistant_31f_sent_him_a_text/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ios6r0/my_27f_husbands_29m_assistant_31f_sent_him_a_text/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"TL;DR – My husband’s assistant, who is also a family friend, sent him a message asking him when he was going to divorce me.

My kindle recently broke so I’ve been using my husband’s iPad to read ebooks. His phone is synced to it, so his messages show up on it.

This morning I was using it when he got a weird text from her, I didn’t open it until I saw the message “when are you going to divorce her”. The conversation went something like this:

Her: Had another fight?\*

Her: You shouldn’t put up with her sh\*t

Her: When are you going to divorce her?

Him: I’m not

Her: You should

Her: She’s using pregnancy to be awful to you

Her: You do realise that?

Him: We’re not having this conversation.

Her: We should

Him: \[something work related\]

Her: Whatever, fine.

My husband’s assistant is also a family friend of his. They’re like siblings since they’ve known each other their whole lives and she’s always been nice to my face. I’m honestly shocked by the messages and I don’t know if I should say anything or just act like I never saw them.

Do I confront her? Do I confront him? Or should I just drop it.

\*Just for context we had a dumb argument about pregnancy cravings. I’ll admit it was mostly my fault, but my husband has a habit of buying me a small gift whenever we have an argument whilst he’s at work to try to avoid a second argument even if we’ve already made up. Which is how I think she knows (I don't think he outright told her).

Edit to clarify: No, I haven't conditioned my husband to buy me gifts every time we argue. He's been doing this since he was young according to my MIL (and does it for every single person he's close to even now). I've told him he doesn't have to but he insists he likes doing it. I only mentioned it in the original because his assistant also knows he does this and would know we had an argument if he asked her to get something. Also saying he does it to avoid a second argument was probably unfair but I was upset when I wrote the original and didn't really think about how my word choice would come across to an internet stranger.

I know this is actually a really weird situation. I'm sorry I do my best to raise her but I know that I can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

Yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. When I asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. She told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

I just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. She didn't want to talk today either. I think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. What do I do?

Update:  Hey guys I sincerely thank everyone here for showing their support and giving me some much needed advice. I just wanted to update this. So, my sister came over and took her out so they can have some alone time together. It turns out that she broke up with her boyfriend because he's been cheating on her. Now he's just being and idiot and bombing her with messages and calls. She just blocked him. But he's basically threatening her with ""consequences"" for breaking up with him. "

Thanks everyone for such great advice. You know, I think I knew this all along but wanted to see if it was me that was not thinking right. 

He’s a total idiot and is addicted to porn. He sees situations in his life happening how they do in porn videos. 

I dumped him and he cried his eyes out. Saying he loved me and he wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t want to. It was all for me. All that kind of stuff. I don’t buy it though and I’d actually be worried that he’d hide cameras, just like you guys said. 

Since I posted and since I added the update to my original post, someone else I know told me that he tried to get her to fuck on camera but she wouldn’t do it. She isn’t a virgin though and also not stupid like me!  I’m so happy that I’ve seen him for what he is and I can’t thank you all enough for the great advice you’ve given. 

See ya!

TL;DR: I dumped the guy and he’s a cry baby and has tried something similar before with another girl in my town."

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

Things have been fine until five months ago when I found out she was using a subscription dating app. I was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn’t go on any dates with anyone on the app. I believed her because I know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. After we got back together, I felt that our relationship wasn’t what it used to be, and I often felt neglected by her. She would spend a lot of time texting even when we are FaceTiming at night. She told me she texting her girl friends and I believed her. I went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. But I noticed that she wouldn’t let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. She also told me she’s going on a ski trip with a guy friend in March, but dodged questions when I asked for details of the guy. Finally, I’ve had it and looked through her FB messages, and I found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. I confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. Plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. But upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state I am going to graduate school in). She told me that they only kissed that night. I asked her to show me her texts and FB messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. I found out that she’s been texting and flirting with him the whole time we’ve been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so I wouldn’t be suspicious. She also didn’t tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her Ex. She was apologetic when I confronted her and I made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. She reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he’s not interested in a relationship anyway.

I feel so hurt right now and can’t fall asleep. She’s my first girlfriend and I love her so much. Her family treats me like another son. But the logical side of me knows that I cannot trust her anymore. I have to stay with her until Saturday and I don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and FB for months even during the holidays when I’m visiting her. She met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

Update:
Thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. Maybe I’m an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. We talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. It was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). She pretty much said she didn’t feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. We both agreed that she was wrong and that she should’ve broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. She feels ashamed of what she did. I will still stay until Saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. But we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. Being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. Thank you everybody for your input. "
i3jop0,My abusive husband got surgery to remove a brain tumour and now he's completely different.

We have a 3 year old daughter.

My husband was abusive to me from the beginning. He was also quite manipulative, and convinced me (who already had very low self esteem) that he was my only chance at love and that I could never find someone better. He also regularly physically abused me. Before the marriage, I tried to leave him once, but he stormed to my family's house and dragged me back into his car. He has even threatened to kill me if I ever left him again.

I put up with all of his abuse because I loved him. Also he was a handsome, rich trust-fund baby so everything about him looked good on paper. But about four months ago, I decided I was tired of the abuse and secretly drew up plans to get divorced.

Just about a month after that, my husband got an MRI after a head injury and it showed that he also had a brain tumour. He went into surgery to have it removed. After the surgery, his personality is like ""night and day"". He is more empathetic and compassionate now. He doesn't hit me or yell at me anymore. He's even agreed to marriage counselling, which is something he never would have before.

However, my sister still thinks I should get the divorce. She doesnt trust him, and is wondering if his ""new personality"" is all just an act. Or if he'll revert to his old evil self over time. My sister said ""You'll be better off living a life away from the guy who beat you up because he didn't like dinner, or the guy who once locked you in a closet for hours after an argument.""

But he's really like a different person, and is actually remorseful of his past behaviour. The other day he started crying and apologizing when he saw the scar on my shoulder from when he pushed me into a bookshelf

Am I crazy for wanting to give our marriage a second chance? I love him even more now than I did before, but a part of me still wonders if this is all an act or if he'd revert to his old self over time.

Tl;Dr: Formerly abusive husband is completely changed after brain tumour surgery. Should I still leave him?"
hmr43w,A guy (20M) I’m (17F) seeing took the condom off in the middle of sex.,10065,0.92,1234,2020-07-07 14:37:03,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmr43w/a_guy_20m_im_17f_seeing_took_the_condom_off_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmr43w/a_guy_20m_im_17f_seeing_took_the_condom_off_in/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Some context, I was raped 9 months ago. The quarantine was honestly a blessing because I didn’t have to have an excuse to isolate and hide myself from the world. My close friends know it happened and I reported it to the police but I have no hopes of it going anywhere. 

So about a month ago my close friend (D) and I decided to hang out with her boyfriend and one of our other friends (B). Social distancing and mask were involved. I’ve always liked B and he’s always been flirty but it was nothing more than that. Anyway after that hang out we started texting more often and being flirty and he told me he liked me. I was beyond happy to hear this because I’ve had a small crush on him for awhile. 

Last night the four of us hang out again, he was very touchy feely (he knows I was sexually assaulted) and drinks were consumed (mostly wine and beer) and weed was smoked. I was fine, I was a little tipsy and crossed but I was fully aware of what was happening. B and I started making out in his car and I was all for it, he asked to have sex, I was super nervous because it would be my first time having sex since I was assaulted. 

I was okay with it and said yes, but he must use a condom, and I said this multiple times. He HAS to use a condom. So he put one on and he had sex in his car. After we were done he pulled out and I noticed he wasn’t wearing a condom. I freaked out thinking maybe it slipped off inside of me (embarrassing) or that maybe it broke. And then he said, “Nah I took it off because it was getting uncomfortable” and I realized he had completely cum inside me.

I didn’t know what to say. I was completely shocked. I was scared to say anything. We got dressed and I told him I want to go home and he got me an Uber and gave me a kiss good bye. 

A friend bought me a Plan B today and I took it. B has been texting me all day, saying he misses me, can’t wait to see me again but I haven’t responded. I can’t stop thinking about what happened. I feel ashamed and dirty all over again. I can’t even explain it. I feel like I was assaulted again. I know that sounds so silly but I’m so heartbroken and lost and my soul is still completely shattered by my sexual assault and now I feel like all the process I made has completely deteriorated. I feel so hurt and I can’t help but feel it’s over something so little and stupid.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Should I confront him? Should I tell someone what happened to me? Should I just forget it happened and moved on? 

Am I making a bigger deal out of this?

UPDATE: WOW! The very first comment on this post was that this was rape and it through me off and I got off my phone. I’m okay. I talked to my mom. After some research, I’m not going to do anything legally but he has been blocked. I didn’t even want to talk to him or confront him because I can’t handle any bullshit or manipulation right now. I told my close friend (D in the story) and her and her boyfriend are both disgusted by him and want nothing to do with him either. I’m just really sadden that’s this was my first time having sex after what happened to me a few months ago and I have to go through this emotional turmoil all over again. 

I’m reading all your messages right now! There’s a lot but thank you for your kind words and support everyone. I’m going to be okay. Love to you all. Stay safe out there. X

SECOND UPDATE: I’m going to answer a few question on here and hopefully people see it. The reason I’m not moving forward with a police report because in my state (California) it isn’t fully recognized as sexual assault (unless I’m wrong or need to read more up to date material). I’m already going through with my past rape and to add another one on top of it is just exhausting and I just want it to be all over with. I didn’t want to confront him and I have no proof that it happened either. My friend (D) has been blasting him on social media, which I’m not too comfortable with, but if it lets other girls know what he’s up to then that’s okay. My mom is enraged. It’s scary how mad she is. Not at me but at him. Especially because she knew him and thought he was a good kid. 

I’m currently in therapy for sexual trauma, but a lot of the sessions have been over the phone or video chat because of Covid so next time I speak to my therapist I’ll tell her about what happened. I’m also going to make an appointment to get tested for STD’s. I have a lot of resources and support from friends and family. I like to think I’m a strong person after everything I’ve been through and I’m determined to get through this too. I’m actually in tears after reading a lot of your guys messages, it means so much to not only have people say it’s okay to feel this hurt by it, but how many strangers care about me. A lot of you have given me a lot of advice, and a lot of resources and I appreciate it so much. 

I’ve come to realize I wasn’t ready to be sexually active again. I didn’t feel pressured by him but I wanted him to like me and I thought maybe if I had sex with him he would. I don’t know how to explain myself, I know I don’t have to but just deep inside I’ve been conditioned to believe that if you want a boy to like you, you have to have sex with them.

I’m going to take along time to focus on me now and not on relationships or boys."
f5nuqe,[UPDATE]: [23M] my girlfriend [25F] is obsessed with psychedelics and her spiritual journey,10053,0.96,908,2020-02-18 12:35:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f5nuqe/update_23m_my_girlfriend_25f_is_obsessed_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f5nuqe/update_23m_my_girlfriend_25f_is_obsessed_with/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f37u41/23m_my_girlfriend_25f_is_obsessed_with/)

It's been a few days since my post and since the post got a lot of traction I decided to post an update. 

In the end, I made the decision to try psychedelics in order to try and understand my girlfriend's point of view better as I truly love her. I and my GF bought some magic shrooms from a trusted common friend and did it together in my apartment as I felt the safest there. We both consumed 3.5g each (total of 7g). 

The trip was a blast (I figured as much) and we laughed, were intimate and had an overall great experience. It was unlike any other substance I've tried before but then again I'm the kind of guy who rarely consumes drugs or alcohol. 

After the trip, I felt my GF was very focused on how my experience was and I could see her face brightened up with excitement as she asked me about the trip afterward. She probably wanted me to feel like this was some sort of spiritual thing just like she does. But in the end, I felt like this was just like any other drug in the sense that it's a drug that manipulates a part of your body/mind. I could see she felt disappointed that I didn't find this trip as spiritual and insightful as she does.

I also realized why my GF likes doing psychedelics and I also sensed during the trip that she was trying to deal with a lot of personal issues, I don't have to go into detail but it was regarding trauma, social anxiety and amongst other issues. I tried talking to her about therapy instead but she strongly refused, she says it's a waste of money and time and this way is better and more ""fun"". 

We've talked for hours and hours and I came to the conclusion that she won't be stopping this ""self-medication"" and she has also planned for an out of country trip to take ""stronger"" psychedelics with a shaman in the future. 
I realized that our pathways in life don't align anymore and that her mindset isn't that of someone I fell in love with. I fell in love with this smart, outgoing girl that loved video games and animals but now she's more into spirituality and the afterlife than the present and science. 

I knew breaking up would be difficult for both of us so I tried doing it in a sensible and calm way but she wasn't as understanding as I thought, she started by crying and then rage ensued. Currently, I've been avoiding her but she has been spamming me trying to get together again, ironically enough she has tried to get me to take DMT as she says that if shrooms didn't do the trick to ""convert"" me, DMT certainly will.
I'm done.


thanks for all the replies in the previous post."
1724eoy,UPDATE: I [25M] have been on a few dates with a trans person [25MTF].

I couldn't get the original throwaway account to work again so I had to make a new account.

Hello again everyone, I originally posted asking for advice a while ago and was honestly pretty shocked with the amount of replies I got. Apart from a few crazies on either side, the vast majority of the replies were helpful as well.

Given the number of replies originally I thought people might be interested in an update post so here it is.

There were a few questions that kept being asked so here are my answers:

1 - If she doesn't have bottom surgery why don't you just do anal?

I'm not into anal so I wouldn't be interested in that with a trans women or a cis woman

2 - Why are you leading her on by going on dates with her before asking about her genitals if that is a hard boundry for you?

I think its rude to ask someone about their genitals before/on the first couple of dates lol

3 - Why is a penis a dealbreaker for you?

This seemed to cause some people a lot of offence and I got some very angry comments and messages about my ""genital preferences"" being transphobic and wrong (which seemed to be a very fringe opinion). I can't tell you the specific reason I'm not attracted to penises, presumably the reason that most other guys who consider themselves straight aren't attracted to other penises?

4 - Why are you going on dates with trans women if having a penis is a hard boundary for you?

I was originally under the impression that most trans women would have bottom surgery so I didn't think this would be a big problem. I've since learned that most trans women don't actually get bottom surgery but even so I think its still worth taking the time to go on dates with someone and find out because there are also a hundred reasons why I might decide to not date a cis woman after the 4th date.

Ok, so as I mentioned above, the main thing I learned from my original post is that the most trans people will never get bottom surgery. I had been under the impression that basically all trans people will have bottom surgery which was obviously not true. Knowing this, I decided that I definitely wanted to ask her in advance to prevent any embarrassing moments at my house. I also didn't want to ask her in a public setting in case the question upset her so I thought the best method would be to text her.

Shoutout to /u/FaeryRing who wrote an amazing message which I ended up using:

""Hey I've been really enjoying our dates so far a lot. I've lately been thinking about it and thought I should let you know that I do have some boundaries around sex relating to genitalia. I feel like we should discuss this before we go any further, to make sure we're not sexually incompatible on a fundamental level.""

As most people predicted, she wasn't offended and she had actually been planning on telling me the next time we met. The upshot is that she hasn't had bottom surgery yet but she is planning to have the operation and is actually on the waiting list. We live in the UK so the procedure is free, however she told me that she has been on the waiting list for 3 years and is expecting another year wait before she can get the procedure done. She also told me that if we wanted to continue dating, she would be fine with not doing any sexual stuff that involved anything below her waist until she had fully transitioned.

I told her that's absolutely fine with me and she came around to my house for dinner and a movie like we had planned. I'm not going to go into details but I will say we did end up fooling around a little and it was honestly amazing. She ended up staying the night at my house and I asked her the next morning if she wanted to be official/exclusive with me and she said yes :) .

So she's now my girlfriend and everything is going great. Yesterday we met up together with a few of my friends and they all really like her so I'm very optimistic that it's going to work out between us.

TLDR; I asked her about bottom surgery and she told me that she is on the waiting list for the procedure with hopefully a year left. We're now officially dating and everything is looking great"

Everything in our relationship is perfect for us. He’s the best husband and father to our kids that I could have asked for. I am absolutely in love with him and his actions and words have always shown me that he feels the same way. There’s no better feeling than going to sleep in his arms every night.

Last weekend, my husband and I had some friends over and we were having a barbecue. We were all outside in the backyard, surrounding my husband who was on the grill. As the food got closer to being ready to eat, we all started sitting at our backyard table. Once the food was all ready and at the table, my husband went inside to use the washroom and get another case of beer. I didn’t realize that my best friend (28F) had followed him. When he was coming back out, my best friend hid behind the wall separating our kitchen and living room and surprised him by pulling him and forcing a kiss. My husband immediately pushed her back and yelled wtf. She immediately started crying and ran out of the house and left. My husband came back into the backyard and asked to speak to me privately and immediately told me what had just happened. I was shocked and told him that it would be okay and that we could talk after everyone else left. I managed to put on appearances for the next couple of hours but I was mentally distraught.

After everyone left, my husband sat me down and told me what happened and showed me the footage from our living room camera. It was exactly as my husband has described it. My best friend of 10 years, the person who I treated as my literal sister, forcibly kissed my husband. After the third date with my husband, she was the one I told that I was going to marry him. She knows how much I love him and how strong our relationship is and still she chose to try to come in the middle. For fuck’s sake, our 3 year old calls her “Aunty”. 

My best friend tried showing up the next day “just to talk” and my husband had to hold me back from beating the shit out of her and he kicked her out and told her to not come back. It’s been almost a week now and I’m nowhere close to moving on. I don’t blame my husband one bit. He’s completely innocent in this and if anything, he’s the victim. I’ve been lying down on my husband’s chest and just crying every day and night. I’m so angry and frustrated and don’t know what to do. My husband has been amazing and like always, he just gets it and understands how I’m feeling. He brought me flowers almost every day and cooked my favorite meals multiple times in the last few days. I love and appreciate him all the more for it. I just don’t know how I’m going to move on and trust any of my friends again after this.

axd8v6,A Tinder experiment with my [28M] girlfriend [27F] of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.,10014,0.95,1751,2019-03-05 03:50:42,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axd8v6/a_tinder_experiment_with_my_28m_girlfriend_27f_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axd8v6/a_tinder_experiment_with_my_28m_girlfriend_27f_of/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Hi all. 

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. I met her IRL, but before that I was having no success with the Tinder game. She, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200B;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on Tinder, and I laughed with her and added ""Tinder's way worse for guys, though"". She didn't believe me when I told her most guys get 0 matches, and I wouldn't either. So we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up Tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. And the obvious happened: after one week, I had pretty much no matches except bots. On the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what I judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). She admitted I was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". We agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
The problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. Basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. I sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. When I asked if the Tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""I don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200B;

I feel like I've played myself here. Is this doomed or is there any way I can save it? 

&#x200B;

TL ; DR: played a Tinder experiment with my girlfriend and now it looks like she's way more distant and cold towards me.

ikp6y2,UPDATE; My (25F) partner bought his affair partner around our daughters (9 and 5),10007,0.96,471,2020-09-01 23:24:32,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikp6y2/update_my_25f_partner_bought_his_affair_partner/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikp6y2/update_my_25f_partner_bought_his_affair_partner/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Found out my partner had been having an affair, didn’t realise he’d involved the children.


We’ve been going counselling  since he admitted to the affair, which ended 6months ago.

I have two daughters; Lucy and Jessica, Jessica had ran up to Naomi (the affair partner) despite not having reason to know Naomi which is how I found out that he had involved Lucy and Jessica.

Lucy is not my partner’s biological daughter but he’s always treated her the same, when I asked about being involved with the affair Jessica had told me it was meant to be a secret.

Lucy had told me the basics which was family days out etc which hurt but I had decided to wait to confront my partner in counselling but throughout the day Lucy had 3 accidents and got so anxious she threw up all of her dinner.

I asked Lucy and she wouldn’t tell me which is unlike her so after some probing she told me that daddy had told her that if she told me when we separated he wouldn’t be her daddy anymore and wouldn’t want her.

This was a lot of stress on Lucy and explains her wetting herself constantly lately, we’d assumed she had a weak bladder as my sister had the same problem around Lucy’s age.

I obviously couldn’t sit on that info and confronted him that very night.


We got into this huge screaming fit, a lot of harsh things were said and as it turns out Naomi is pregnant! He’d never ended things with her but rather couldn’t/ didn’t want to decide between us.

I’d love to know how he planned on hiding his other family from me had Jessica not revealed this.

I’ve told Lucy and Jessica that we’re going for a little vacation until school starts (Thursday so not long) and are staying with my brother.

I’ve had one text from what I guess is my ex telling me that he’s sorry things went this way and he’ll always be there for me and Jessica.

Had I wanted to get back together with him and heal our relationship I realise he’d never include Lucy in that.

We’re still going to relationship counselling but mostly for the children now, Lucy is still wetting herself and is blaming herself for this despite not fully knowing what actually happened.

I’m not actually sure where to go from here because everything happened really fast, I’ve told my ex that he needs his things packed for Thursday because I’m not going to mess Lucy around anymore.

For the most part Jessica hasn’t even asked where her dad is but only that she doesn’t want to stay with him alone when I told her he may take her to the park Saturday (not in those words but she cried)

I appreciate all the comments and messages despite not being able to reply to most comments."

Our relationship has had absolutely no issues before this incident. He has been the perfect and most loving partner. However, last week, I came home from work to an intervention with all my close family and friends, orchestrated by my boyfriend, who has apparently convinced them I’m a drug addict.

For context, I have no history of drug use, no behavioural signs that would suggest addiction, and no reason for him to believe otherwise. I believe he knows I’m not on drugs because he has said things to my mom and sister that he knows to be untrue: that things have gone missing around the house (they haven’t), that I’ve used his credit card to withdraw money (I don’t even have his card details), and that I’ve been acting erratically (absolutely nothing out of the ordinary). When I confronted him about all of this, he said “It’s not about the drugs; it’s about making sure you’re safe""

My partner is a psychologist and has convinced my entire family I am displaying all the hallmark signs of drug addiction. They all insist I’m in denial and that I need help. No one is willing to entertain my denials at all. My mom says she isn’t willing to have me over to her house and my sister won’t allow me to see my nieces until I go to rehab. 

Based on conversations with my family and friends, I believe he’s been spinning this story for several months now prior to staging the intervention. 

I am super embarrassed as he organised for practically all my close friends, family, and even a work colleague attend the intervention. But more than that, I feel utterly betrayed and confused. I can’t understand his motivation for doing this. Can anyone offer me some insight as to what is prompting this otherwise normal man to do this? 

**TL;DR:** **My boyfriend falsely claimed I’m a drug addict, staged an intervention, and now all of my family and friends believe him and insist I’m in denial.**"

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

My wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). New people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

My brother in law lives very close to us. He is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. My own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. This is something I never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. It wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that I got suspicious. Apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

Now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth I dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. That is just...disgusting to me. Tonight I did something which I never done or felt the need to do before, and I checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. Most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. But after having scrolled through a ton of messages I find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. I am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

Having sit here now thinking about what to do I cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. So many times have I heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

I am really at a loss at this point, I have no doubts about what she has done, but I cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

I feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

I want to divorce her, but I dont know how to go on about finding out whether I am the father or not, I really dont know what to do if I found out my son wasnt mine.

​

Edit: After reading several comments I decided it is best to not confront her now. My wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and I just told her I am not feeling well. I can barely look her in the eyes at this point. The only reason I am keeping it together is for my son. I wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so I will sit infront of the TV and sleep on the couch.

​

Edit 2: Had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. I wont be reading more PM's, I have gotten way too many of them.

Currently staying with my sister, I decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so I just told her I will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. My sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. I have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. We scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why I will get it via a court.

I will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something I will ever accept or can forgive. It's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. To the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

I will confront her but I cant tell when, probably tomorrow. My sister wants to come with me, but I wont let her, I will head over there by myself and let her know what I found out, will see where it goes from there...

Thank you all so much for your comments. 

I took some of the advice I saw and had another chat with my husband. I made sure to make it very serious and told him that I was no longer feeling comfortable in my own home, and that constantly dreading what prank would be next was making it miserable to live with him. At first he was somewhat goofy like before, but when I said how on edge I was every day because of his pranks, how much trust in him I had lost, and that I would leave the house if his pranks didn't stop, he immediately sobered up and apologized. He said he'd had no idea how strongly I'd felt about it, and that he wouldn't do it anymore. He seemed 100% serious and remorseful, unlike the other conversations where he had just laughed it off. He told me that he had never intended to push me away and had just thought of it as a funny game between us while in quarantine. He apologized several times and even seemed close to tears when I mentioned leaving. 

After the conversation was over and we'd cleared everything up, he immediately went to go clear a couple of booby traps he'd set up prior to the convo. I really don't think he'll do it again. 

TL;DR: We worked everything out

Anyway, thanks again to everyone who offered advice!"

This all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. I obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that I initially did not end the relationship. (What a regret).

How I handled it was we met the next morning to talk and I let her explain her side of things. She explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. Keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. Nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. I explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. So in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

I was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but I did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

We had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. Then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. There were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. I did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts I made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. Which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. This was getting old but I was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. The deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'You're the love of my life, I Love you more than anything, Future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. These were all exploited to be absolute lies.

Fast forward to a few nights ago. We had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. I let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding I then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. She did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. I let her know, 'Hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' It makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. She ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of Ok we will just talk later. I call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, I had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

She calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. I ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""Oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... I know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you I was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. I keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. She then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that I cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. She tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

Meanwhile, I knew I had friends going out that night as well and I could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. I did not tell her I was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 AM rolls around and Im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. I walk down the street and LO AND BEHOLD there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. One of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. Shocker, I know. I confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and NO accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. I turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because I'm sure i was irate. I have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. I walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. She shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. I tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. She says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. Even though i'm pretty hurt at this point I cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. I tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. Should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and I truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. I left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

I do want to say though, I made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. So many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i Just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. And it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing I have ever had done to me. Listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. If you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

Even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, I ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way I cared for them. Who knows how much longer I would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but I am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. Sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. Much Love.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. Felt I was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. Caught her on a date with another guy. Broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

Edit: I really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback I’ve gotten here. As well as all the insightful messages I’ve received. I am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. Thank you

Edit 2: For the people responding thinking I was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. Let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. I did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. Which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story."

We have been married for 11 years in August. 

I love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. And it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. Every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or “doggy style”. Sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

I constantly tell her how beautiful she is, I tell her how much she means to me, and I try my best to do whatever I can to lay signals that Im into her. I hug her, I stand close to her in public, I make it well known that Im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

She reciprocates none of it. She never comes on to me unless I straight up ask her to (seriously, Ill ask, “can you do me tonight?”) she doesn’t spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. I work long hours, and Ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips “no” in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. She gets upset if I cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and I came on top of her pussy). She keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. It fucking sucks. The sexiness factor is zero. I love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn’t there at all and Im not sure I can do it anymore. Its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

Anywho, it came to head tonight. I asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. She said yes. So the time comes, she was on me and I wasn’t totally into it, so I started to get soft. I made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as I had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so I didn’t ask). So she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn’t want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. I lost it. I said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. This is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and Im fucking done with it. She has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

I cant live like this. There is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  Im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. This was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

Tldr: I am married to my roommate who I occasionally have sugar free vanilla sex with."
g8d98r,Wife had been flirting with her coworker. She said she would stop but it just happened again... is there any future in this relationship?,9892,1.0,247,2020-04-26 17:38:07,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/wife_had_been_flirting_with_her_coworker_she_said/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"My wife and I have been married for slightly more than three years now. Last Christmas, I found she had been having a long conversation with a coworker of hers, in which they talked about having had sex multiple times and that they couldn’t wait for the next one. The guy said he was going to book a hotel near their office right after Christmas. In this conversation, when he said he was looking forward to seeing my wife, she would reply with things like “I’m looking forward to much more than just seeing you”, etc. You get the idea. Overly flirty and sexual.

When I confronted my wife, she denied the conversation existed. After deleting it, she showed me her phone to prove it didn't exist. But I had taken a few pictures. She then said it was all virtual and that they never did anything physical. To prove she was right, she messaged her coworker (in front of me) asking if he had booked the hotel, he replied “not yet”. She then asked if he was really expecting them to meet, to which he replied negatively. She promised they would never talk again and I agreed, simply because I love her a lot and wanted to trust her, but in my mind I wasn’t completely sure she had been honest.

For a few weeks, I must admit I checked her phones a few too many times, so she changed her password, which I was fine with because I was probably being too paranoid. This week, I picked her phone up because I needed a code that had been sent to her phone number (I didn’t even need to unlock the screen to get it). To my surprise, under the message with the code there were other messages from the same guy. One of them was an audio, the second one was a shirtless photo of himself in front of a mirror, and the third one said “sweaty” and a few emojis with the tongue.

I confronted her since she had promised they wouldn’t talk ever again and she said he just wanted to show her he’s going to the gym to show progress. But that the rest of the times they talk it’s just about work, and that this is just a coincidence. I asked her to show me the rest of their messages but she said she had mistakenly deleted their conversation history.

My wife says she’s going to change this time and that I never really forgave her and that’s why she kept talking to the guy. She says this time she’s really going to stop but I have a hard time believing it. Or even if she does stop, I fear when things don't go so well between us she'll do it again. I really love her but can’t keep living like this. Is there any situation in which this can work? What would you do?"

UPDATE: The date went really really well! Nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. The drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of Oregon and was super scenic. We only saw two other cars. When we got to the falls we were the only people. Chinook Salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. The bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. I kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. I think I did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. We stayed until it almost got dark. 


I did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this Indian Casino. She said she had never gambled in her life so I brought her in and we had a drink and I gave her 20$ to spend. She found this bee slot machine (my last name has Honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! At that point it was getting pretty late so I walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. I am going to see her this weekend again. Definitely STOKED!"

They left before I could say anything and I don’t feel comfortable making a video of her like that. She hasn’t had an accident or bathed yet and I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to make the video, what should I do

Edit:I called them explaining that I wouldn’t record their daughter and that if they had an issue with that then they need to come back immediately. About 1.5 hours later they come back pissed off at me saying that I wasn’t getting paid for the several hours that I babysat. I told them not to bother asking me to work again and left."

thank you everyone who supported me throughout this. i think im over it and it's just a thing that happened i guess. 

EDIT 2: people, i am gonna make an update in a few days when there's enough news to bring home. 

EDIT: hey everyone. thank you all so much for the wonderful comments. i've been packing for the past 2 hours to go to my mom's, thankfully he still hasn't come back. if he ran away, its wishful thinking on his end. i talked to my dad, who is an ex-cop, and he knows some people that would help with my situation. 

i honestly cant believe what he did to me, even till now. it was so impulsive of him, he was never like this. regardless, im too disgusted by the thought of him right now. i consider myself to be a resilient person and can brush this off (the experience, not the problem itself), its just that im still shocked by what happened, and the fact that it did. ill reply to some of you as soon as im settled at my mom's.

i just wanna mention that i got a message from someone on here telling me that i should've expected it?? disappointed when i read that.

original post:

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 months. we’re currently living together (for the past 2 months, edited this part due to people misunderstanding), and we’re an admittedly kinky couple, so “abuse” is part of our sex routine. we are always safe about what we do, and have a safe word and everything.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn’t wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear “wanna try anal?” but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said “sure, just make it quick.” he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn’t listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (“b******n”) 5 times and he didn’t respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the ER and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn’t healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven’t seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don’t know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this."
hz044f,My boyfriend(m20) thinks I'm gaslighting him cos nothing comes out my boobs when I'm horny,9825,0.96,997,2020-07-28 01:55:12,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hz044f/my_boyfriendm20_thinks_im_gaslighting_him_cos/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hz044f/my_boyfriendm20_thinks_im_gaslighting_him_cos/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,True,False,False,"Honestly my life is a fucking mess. My boyfriend is a bit of a loner but its never really been a problem before. We both love video games and to him I'm quite a catch because ""its not often you find a pretty girl who likes games"", now that statement can be taken a lot of different ways but it looks like a compliment to me so. Most of his life experiences come from the internet which is fine I guess but he really doesn't have that balance, since we started dating I've been dragging him around with me and taking him to try new things. We've had a couple obstacles, period of time where he spent literally no attention to me and just played video games( that ended in march, thank god) and convincing him that smelling nice isn't just a capitalist scheme lol. So I (19f) was ready to lose my virginity to this guy, i really love him and overall he's an amazing guy, he was also a virgin so we were comfortable to just mess around.

The next day he's all stand offish and pissed at me, I ask why and he asks me if I was just pretending to be into it last night. I say no, I was wet you saw that, I love you ect.. and this, god I'm so fucking pissed about this, he says your lying, if you were actually horny MILK would come out your boobs. I just can't fucking express how goddamn infuriating, awful angry idk I just, that? seriously? like he'd never really been ""in"" reality or whatever but dude for fucks sake, I'm in a stunned silence and He's like, ""guess its true if you have nothing to say, I thought you werent like other women but your all the same, I thought you loved me blah blah fucking blah."" and idk, like its like I have the man I love and then I have this bumbling idiot who I also have to deal with and its just shitty. Evidently he's only experienced sex from porn, never thought it out of the ordinary cos he'd never talked to girls and only has brothers, additionally people he used to roleplay with would do it to, so he took it as fact.

I tried so hard to explain but it was like talking to a brick wall, he claimed that I was gaslighting him, that I'm an abusive girlfriend, I'm gonna cheat on him and he was upset, he truly believed that I was this evil fucking bitch.

We haven't talked, we've both been crying, his friends are all yesmen, I think they may have convinced him that this stupid thing was a fact because he wasnt chatting with them as much, they didnt like me so  its not that hard to believe. I was that bigotted outsider in their eyes who was flexing on them by going for walks and joining clubs I guess. He always seemed to brush of their remarks though. I'm stuck, this is just so stupid, so ridiculous, I don't want my first relationship to end because my boyfriend was surprised that im not one of his hentai girls. I love every part of him besides his obliviousness, and seeing him look me in the eye like I've stabbed him, say that I'm a dirty cheater because of his stupid porn addiction just hurts. I'm pissed and upset and angry and I hate that I'm hating him right now, it's just such a stupid fucking idea, like why the fuck would I lactate during sex? I want the boyfriend I love back and dumping him cos liquid didnt dribble out my boobs is just embarrassing.

&#x200B;

Edit: The overwhelming verdict is leave him I guess, I'll sleep on it.

Edit2: He blew this way out of proportions and **he broke up with me.** Thanks anyway guys but I guess I don't need relationship advice seeing as I'm not in one. I'm just gonna go to my best friends place. Bye.

Final Edit: I had to add this because it cheered me up a little . My sister said that there is a trinity of getting wet, no-ones ever seen two of them but we still believe they are there. (if you don't get the joke she was comparing god and the holy spirit to each nipple, ) its insensitive but im honestly at the end of my thread and i really need some shitty jokes (besides my ex boyfriend) in my life.

FinalEdit2: If anyone has any ideas on why he did this in particular, tell me cos closure would be nice

Update: I HAVE TEA MYDUDES. I'm stilll upset, honetsly our relationship was very mixed and I don't know how long it'll take for me to get over him. He's blocked me on everything so thats half the work done I guess. I had some grief sex with my best girl friend last night ( apparently im bi now idfk) and everythings going really fast. Idk what to feel. She's liked me for a really long time but being straight out a relationship she doesnt want to be my rebound so she said she'll wait for me before she asks me out I guess? I have no fucking clue whats happening in my life. I've got literally no time to just think. Really, I thought it would take forever to find someone who cares  for me again but it took about 5 hours so idfk whats happening anymore. My life is fucking mess guys.

gsisyl,My (26M) girlfriend (26F) drunkenly told me she was starving herself to be more attractive to me.

I’m not sure if she even remembers telling me but don’t know how to bring it up.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years - classic college sweetheart romance. I love her and if she believed in marriage I’d put a ring on her in an instant. However, due to some trauma from her childhood and her parents’ rough marriage she doesn’t believe in it. Fine with me and we’ve resolved to build our lives together regardless. We’ve lived together for 3 years now and due to our sleep schedules we don’t fall asleep at the same time. It’s never been a problem for us and she’s said she falls asleep better having the bed to herself anyway. We cuddle together every night though before I get up to play some games or watch TV in our living room. Our sex life is amazing and I genuinely think she’s incredibly sexy. However, I still like to masturbate late at night because it’s fun and a good stress reliever. The things I look at are just porn to me and have no bearing on how I feel about her. Just porn. 

Anyway, getting down to the crux of the problem, we were having a good time together last night and we’re having some drinks and playing games together. We both got a little wasted (we’re both off work due to COVID) and she told me while she was drunk that she’s been purposefully not eating to look more like the girls I masturbate to. She said they were all petite girls and looked nothing like her. Now, that’s true, but I love my girlfriend’s curves and think she’s incredibly sexy. I was shocked but also drunk and didn’t know how to address it beyond telling her I think she’s gorgeous no matter what. I had no idea she had even caught me masturbating but must have in the past. I do save pictures of other women on my computer but purely as a “spank bank” situation. 

She HAS been losing weight and was overweight before so she’s been getting down to a healthy weight. I assumed she’s been doing it through diet and exercise but because of our different sleep schedule we only ever had dinner together and apparently that’s all she’s been eating while doing daily workouts. I’m devastated that she thinks she had to change for me and also don’t know how to bring it up to her and not sure if she even remembers telling me that. 

What can I do to address this in a healthy way and also get her some help without her shutting down on me?"
1cw1it1,UPDATE: My (21F) Husband (26M) told me that he listens outside the bathroom door the entire time I'm showering to see if I'm masturbating. How can I tell him that this is a violation of my privacy and personal space without him feeling like I'm disrespecting him?,9749,0.98,1024,2024-05-20 04:59:17,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cw1it1/update_my_21f_husband_26m_told_me_that_he_listens/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cw1it1/update_my_21f_husband_26m_told_me_that_he_listens/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/X1lene3tJt) to original post for context.

TLDR: I confronted him about this being an invasion of my privacy and he did not react well. I am leaving him and moving in with a friend until I'm done school next month, before moving back home. 

Thank you so much to all of the amazing people who commented and reached out. I wasn't able to respond to anywhere near all of them but I am so grateful to everyone for opening my eyes to how toxic and unhealthy this situation is.

As I stated in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/6YrfdVAheR) update, I called my dad and basically just explained that we were having some issues, and just to ease my mind I wanted him to come down and be nearby when I talked to my husband. 
He did not press for more info and told me that he was on his way. He and my mom live ~6 hours away, so it's not exactly a very ideal ask but he didn't even hesitate, which I am grateful for.
He arrived Friday night and parked outside our condo and we agreed that id call him and immediately hang up if I needed him to come inside, in case my husband got aggressive or angry. I did not expect him to, since he never has before, but some of the comments made me feel like I'd better be safe rather than sorry.

I debated all day Friday about how exactly to approach this situation and how I could trigger this conversation without him shutting down or getting angry.
I decided to casually approach the conversation and ask him how he'd feel about me getting another vibrator (to replace the one that mysteriously broke after he 'caught' 'me using it in the shower).
In response he asked ""what for?"" To which I replied ""because it feels good"".
I knew this would be his response, but it was something along the lines of ""what am I not good enough""? As it usually was in the past. I explained to him that it has nothing to do with him not being good enough, and that sex is supposed to be fun and experimental and interesting and that it was just something that would make it better for both of us. He then suggested that I just wanted it to use on myself, to which I asked if that would be a problem. He told me that I know how he feels about that and so I asked him why he was bothered by the idea of me masturbating. He got very defensive and asked why I would want that when I could have him, so I asked if he ever felt like he'd rather just pleasure himself rather than going through the motions of having sex. He said no and that he's ""not a beta who spends his days stroking when he could be doing anything more productive"". I explained to him that that was okay if it was his preference but that sometimes my sexual desires are to pleasure myself versus having sex. That's when his same ridiculous argument came out of that being ""basically cheating"". Pulling from another Redditor, I explained that cheating involves multiple people, and that it is impossible to be cheating if I am alone. He told me to ""fuck off and go stick the shower head between my legs"".
I started to get upset and realized that here is when I always back down. I feel the need to apologize and make him feel better, id usually have started something and would end up guilt fucking him because I felt bad, but I didn't. 
I told him that he made me feel like he was trying to control me and my body and that I wasn't okay with that. 
He told me I could ""go be a fucking whore somewhere else then"" and got up off the couch and ran upstairs. I could hear him slamming my drawers open and acting like he was putting my clothes in a bag.
I resisted the urge to run up there after him and just decided to sit there and see what would happen. Eventually he came back downstairs and apologized and said that he's very uncomfortable with the idea of me masturbating in our home, when I asked him to explain why, he said because it makes him feel unwanted. I told him that this isn't true, and that I do want him, but sometimes I just want that and he said ""okay I guess"".

I decided to leave it at that for the night, and didn't want to press any further. I told my dad it was okay to go and that I was so sorry for wasting his time and he told me he'd be staying the weekend at a hotel just to be safe.

Eventually we went up to bed and I realized if I left it at that it would just get swept under the rug like it always does. I'd go on putting up with this until it came full-circle again and I was not going to do that to myself.

I decided to ask him about him telling me that he listened to me when I showered.
I told him I wanted to talk about it and he told me that he was just joking and that ""I'm a fucking moron if I actually thought he was serious"". I told him that it was an odd joke, especially considering he was angry and very much not laughing when he told me. He insisted that he was joking and I told him that i didn't believe him. He then responded by saying he wouldn't do it again. This went in circles for a bit before he finally admitted to deciding to do this after catching me in the shower. Instead of accusing him of anything, I asked him if he thought that was an invasion of my privacy, to which he informed me that we are married and I do not have privacy. I told him that was an issue and that in order to have a healthy marriage we both needed privacy. He was determined that there is so such thing as privacy in marriage, so I flat out asked him if he wanted me in the bathroom while he was pooping. He said no, I said ""right , because you want your privacy"". He told me that's different. 

Over the course of the next 10 minutes or so, this escalated from a simple conversation into a full blown screaming match, and we got absolutely nowhere in our argument. It was like talking to a brick wall. I was so heated by this point that I don't even remember what was said, but he eventually told me I was: a fucking worthless whore, that i had nothing without him, that my vag was disgusting and made him sick, that I was fat and no one will ever want me (I'm 125 lbs btw), that im lucky someone like him would even look in my direction, etc, etc, etc.

I could barely see my phone through the tears and I called my dad and asked him to come get me. 

My husband looked at me and said ""you're fucking dad isn't driving 6 hours to come get you you dumb fuck"".
I started to grab some random things of mine and yelled that he was here staying in town, and he broke down and started sobbing. 

He told me that he knows he's controlling, that he has serious issues, and that he's terrified of losing me. He said that he knows he's not good enough for me and that he's so afraid of losing me that he's pushing me away to save himself the inevitable heartache. He said that if he ever lost me he'd k*** himself. 

As I watched this grown ass man snotting and crying in a heap on the floor, I kinda realized that I feel nothing for him. Like, nothing. The blinders I've been wearing were removed and I no longer saw the handsome, intelligent, caring, strong man I once did. I saw a pathetic, abusive, controlling, sad, and sick person. I came to the realization in that moment that there's no fixing this, and even if he does change, I would never trust him or see him in the same way again. 

My dad knocked on the door and my husband ran and hid in the bathroom. I took my bags and went outside to meet him. He asked me if I wanted to talk about what was going on and I said no. He asked what I needed from him and I asked if we could just go back to his hotel room. He asked if my husband hit me and I said no. 
Before we had even gotten to the hotel my husband began texting me. It started with pleading with me to stay and forgive him and turned into insults over the course of the next day or so. He never threatened me physically, but told me if I didn't come home I'd lose him forever, that I'd be losing out on the best man I'd ever have, etc, etc. he told me that his friends laughed at him for being with such an ugly bitch, that his parents hate me because they know I'm not good enough for him, that I couldn't get pregnant because I'm probably a fucking whore banging other guys on the side, that he was embarrassed to be seen with me in public, and so much more.

I'm leaving. And not because Reddit told me to, because I'm genuinely not even remotely interested in staying with him and because I deserve better.

I spoke to a friend from school, and will be staying with her until I'm done school next month. After that, I'm going home to figure some things out and get a fresh start.

I'm currently in bed in a hotel room with my dad and have never felt more loved or safe. He is going to go over to the house tomorrow and retrieve my belongings, after which he is helping me move into my friend's apartment and then heading home. 

I don't have much to say at this point other than thank you again to everyone who made me realize how dangerous this situation could have been. I was determined that we were not going to divorce but after Friday night I don't think there's any going back to that. I'm over it. 
I might update again, I might not. But making that post genuinely might have saved my life. Thank you.

First of all I want to thank everyone for reading my previous post and giving me good advice. Your comments gave me further insight in this situation. I apologize for not giving you guys frequent updates to this situation as I was busy with work.

So after my last post I talked with my friends and my college professors about this mess. Fortunately almost all of them were ready to help. Later during that day we all decided to talk to my friend (21F). We explained to her about the severity of the situation as she was not ready to run away from her house and if she does not act fast she might end up getting married to the old thug ( I know though she might have been frozen in fear, as this is a important decision in her life and she had not made any such decisions before. She is of the type that always follows the crowd and obeys what the others say. ). After lot of convincing from me other friends and professors she finally decided to act. But she was still hesitant to run away as she might bring a lot of suffering to her little sister(14F) who would still be with her parents. So we had to act keeping her little sister in mind. So we convinced her to take her sister with her. We also involved her sister in our plan.

Now the main problem was where they would stay and who will help her get along. Which was managed by our professor *( Dr M. I will not give his full name here. But Dr sir I know you browse this sub so if you are reading this, I thank you million times. ).* Apparently our professor has a extended family thousands of kilometers from where we live, who are happy to let her and her sister stay rent free for sometime.

So on 25 july at 4am in morning we planned her and her sister escape. We made sure she took her important stuff and documents of her and her sister with her. After we had breakfast at one of my friends place. We all left for the train. We made sure she destroys her old sim card. Skip to the day 27 july we arrived at the place and I helped her unpack. Bought some clothes for her and her sister and overall they seem to get adjusted pretty quickly. We still need to take admission to school for her sister (Fortunately there are free schools for girls in India). And she recently landed a good job. So financially she is settled, but I will still be helping her however she needs.

Meanwhile recently we had filed police complaint about her parents and that man. We also informed women's welfare center about this. Things seem normal and I will keep you guys updated as things progress.

Edit: I have removed one initial from Dr's name.

I have suffered from what my church terms ""same sex attraction"" my whole life. My husband has been my best friend for 30 years,  married for 25. He has felt asexual since as long as he can remember. Our relationship has been one of absolute loving, cuddly but celibate best friends, and while unusual, has been satisfying and worked for us. 

This weekend I attended my 25th high school reunion, about 4 hours from where we live. I stayed with ""Eve,"" my best female friend from back then. I'm not going into details here, frankly I haven't even processed it all yet...we made love several times. I had my first ever orgasm(s), I felt desired, I felt authentic, real, alive. Neither Eve nor I planned or expected this. I'm shedding a lot of self-deception,  determined to actually live my life now.

I'm ready to lose some friends and family, and being unwelcome at my church...but the thing is, my best friend/husband/confidant is totally innocent in all this, and for two days I haven't slept much, etc, and he's sensing something is weighing on my heart. How on Earth do I ask to just switch him to best-friend? This sucks. Thanks for listening or any advice.

Edit/Update --- Thank you all for taking the time to give me much to consider, amidst the deluge of hate and name-calling, there's been a lot of empathy, encouragement,  and thoughtful advice. Thank you so much. Many of you were correct in assumptions about me, and our marriage. So here's a bit more detail...I was trying yesterday not to make my post too long.

Yes, our marriage was very much to avoid the overwhelming stigma in our (raised-in) faith that goes with staying single, wanting to be chidfree, being gay, etc. We both had, and do have great affection for each other, but were not self-aware enough to figure that the social pressure was the reason for our young marriage, and be honest about it to one another until several years in. We've been comfortable about us in an open (privately of course) and honest way. We joke that we are like secret agents, with our own ""cover story""....our main one being that I am, sadly, infertile. 

I prayed every day since I was a teen for God to take away my same sex attraction, and then would pray for forgiveness for being angry at God that it didn't happen. My husband, in whom I confided about my struggle long before we married, has prayed beside me in this countless times, but has always been adamant that he prays for my heart to be at peace about the matter, not for me to change. That has always been incredibly meaningful to me, and I've always let him know it. Praying, for both of us, has increasingly lessened for several years now. Our church attendance is mostly pro-forma now. When I'm there now, I find myself looking around, and wondering how many others are also there ""just to be there.""

No, my husband isn't gay. He's funny, kind, always helping others, the real deal of a man. He's just completely asexual, and about a 9 out of 10 aromantic also. No one, but no one could ever have a better friend. We've discussed in the last few years (HE has brought it up) that perhaps I should have physical relationships with other women to be happy,  but I'd always shut that down. 

Very late last night he told me he knew something was really bothering me, that he had a feeling he knew what it was, and that we are going to talk about it, tonight. And then he held me for what seemed forever.

I’ve been dating her for over a year and I’ll confess I’m not very good in bed but I try. I love her and I thought our relationship was great. Then last night, I saw her fucking my roommate- my best friend who I thought I could count on. I’m socially awkward so I don’t have that many other friends but I thought I didn’t need anymore so long as I had him. 

I saw them openly fucking each other in the living room. I couldn’t help but stare in disbelief. Then I heard my roommate tell my girlfriend to keep it down so as not to wake me up. She responded by saying that I never heard them before so this has clearly been going on a while. 

Now, as I said before, I’m not very good in the bedroom mainly cause of my small size. I’ve always been insecure about this. Seeing my girlfriend cheat on me has amplified this considerably.

I don’t know what to do. It won’t be easy to find a new place to stay and get out of my lease. My family’s abusive so they’re not an option. My few other friends are closer to my roommate than me and I wouldn’t call them confidants of mine. And I’ve emotionally invested a lot into my girlfriend. She was my first one. 

I can’t pretend I didn’t see what I saw. But I don’t know how I can get out of my apartment. And if I do, I’m going to be all alone. I’m already dealing with pain from being betrayed by the two people I thought l could trust and from my personal insecurities. I’m terrified at the prospect of being completely alone as well."

I just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

If you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

As you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. I am his older brother, I am 23 years old while he was 20. That day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (I live in another city), and he decided to stay. We had a long talk, and I was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. He also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

Unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. He lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. I was trying my best. Until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from University so he could focus on healing himself. 

Two days ago I was at work, and he was at home, as always. When I came back I saw something that I hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. He hanged himself. It hurts me saying that. It was rather unexpected. Even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, I never thought he would actually do that. About a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when I asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

Right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.He thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. Even you guys. He said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad I love them. I can't keep up with this anymore. I am sorry. I love you"".

I tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. I don't blame him. Losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. Even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. I am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. We were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. It really sucks to say the least. I soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

I felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. I want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. You guys are amazing.

Thanks once again.

P.S: A few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. If you think that's the case then it's ok. I am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. Sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful. 

As for the rest of you, thank you people for the nice words."

&#x200B;

My older sister(let's call her Rose) and I have a great relationship since I was a baby. we were raised with an amazing adoptive family and she has always taken care of me.

I grew up in a very warm and loving environment but from what i was told I was lucky.

I was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. They never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. When my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when I was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. When I was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. We got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. We never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. Today I'm 19 and Rose is 34, I still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so I come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200B;

So a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a DNA test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. After the results came in I found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% Ashkenazi Jew) I found out later that I had an aunt\[33f\] in the system. I immediately reached out to her(Let's call her Jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. All that without telling Rose a thing.

When we met up I could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. We tried to figure things out so I asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. They never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

I connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. Mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. When I saw the picture, I knew. This was Rose, 100%.

Rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

I immediately gave Jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

I went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now I'm sleeping over at his place. I told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to Rose much.

I can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her I know the truth.

What the hell am I supposed to do? How should I handle this? Should I tell her I know?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). I thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. I have decided to break it to Rose this week but I need some time to think about how to tell her I know.I don't know if I should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. I even considered bringing her sister with me but I genuinely think she will be pissed. I'll keep updating as soon as I'll decide how to tell her. Right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: After seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, I decided I need to explain some things. First of all It's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. We were in foster care that time and Rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually Rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. At that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. At least that what I was told. I don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

So since reading all the responses, I decided to just talk to her. I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t see her as anything less than I did before but that I just felt how I described in the other post. She was pretty understanding. I also asked if she’d be comfortable if I came to one or two of her therapy sessions. I made it clear that if she didn’t want to, I wouldn’t push it. She was kinda quiet at first but decided that it would be beneficial. 

So I went last week and really just talked with her and her therapist. I also talked with the therapist in private. Basically, the points made in the last post about how consensual sex with a loved one is liberating were echoed there. A few other points were brought up as well, but I’d rather not mention those on a public forum. 

A lot of you were saying in the other post how I was making her trauma about me and that this is why some people don’t want to share their past. It was never my intention to do that, and I apologize if that’s how I came off. Her therapist actually recommended some people I could go and see. Finding out that the girl I love had been through so much abuse isn’t just something I could shrug off. And like I said before, I absolutely don’t see her as ‘broken’ or ‘damaged.’ It’s just incredibly saddening to know she had to endure so much suffering. Clearly it’s something that still affects her years later, and I just want to be there for her. She’s always been there for me. I love her."

There were tons of advice in the thread and a lot of support for the shitty situation I was in, and I want to thank you all for trying your best to help me.

In the end, I set up a meeting with my ex's mother, whom I'd mentioned in one of my posts when I was replying to people about this whole thing. It was roughly a week after I'd made my previous post. 

She knew why we were broken up, and completely backed up my decision to break up with her daughter, seeing how much it hurt me. It meant a lot to me, and I guess I never really appreciated her mom being so friendly with me while we were together. I explained to her what had been going on since the break-up, she only knew that the ex was trying to get back together with me, but she didn't know about her showing up at any place I went out, her friends badgering m or the letters and gifts being sent my way constantly. 

I came close to tearing up because of how much support she showed me at the time, at one point she even hugged me and kissed the top of my kid like I was a little kid again. I felt both embarrassed and grateful. I just wanted space and time to heal from this shit and I think she understood as much. All in all, after we got that out in the open, she promised me she would get her daughter back into line, to leave me alone and stop harassing me. We talked a bit some more after that, but went our own ways soon after. 

The ex's harassment continued for a day or two and then it completely stopped. No messages, no calls, no sudden appearances where I was hanging out or anything. Three weeks out and nothing from her so far. It's been bliss. It's like this huge weight just rolled straight off me, it's easier to breathe and I'm not even looking at the door of someplace I'm hanging out at to see if it's the ex or one of her friends. I didn't even notice that myself, my friends were the ones who brought it up to me. So yeah, this is a thousand times better than what it was like before. 

I did talk with my ex's mom one more time over the phone and I thanked her for whatever she did with her daughter, and she was saying it was the least she could do. Near the end of the conversation, she said it would probably be for the best if we didn't speak anymore, it would let me fully move on from this, but that she was sorry it had come to this and that they (her and her husband) wouldn't see me coming over for Christmas. We said our goodbyes and that was that. 

So that's it, the harassment stopped, I'm feeling great and life's really looking better nowadays. One more time, thank you all guys and gals for trying to help me out from the shitpile I found myself in.

I (33 F) have just given birth to a white baby while both my husband (36 M) and I are indian. He thinks I've cheated, meanwhile I'm worried i was raped. i haven't talked to my husband since he left the hospital and i don't know what to do

throwaway because who wants this disaster on their mane account?

A little backstory, although not much is necessary, we're a typical couple (or we where)

We've been married for 5 years, both of indian descent, with dark skin to match.

we met in our workplace where we both still work together and have been (for the most part) happy ever since.

Things have been a little harder the last few years, we'd been trying for a baby for so long and started losing our hope. So when we finally got pregnant with a healthy baby boy, we where over the moon, my husband could not have been more excited to be a dad.

I'm avoiding it but, might as well cut to the chase, my baby is white. At first i didn't even really notice it, he was more red than anything, but once i saw it was like my brain split open right there in the hospital.

I can't entirly recall what happened, but my husband started screaming at me and i didnt even know what to say. of course i never cheated on him, but clear as day the baby is white! He stormed out pretty soon after, and has been at his brothers place ever since. i only know this because his brother texted me.

its been two days, he hasn't talked to me and I'm afraid to reach out, because i have nothing to even say. i understand why hes so angry, but it hurts that he would think I'd cheat, i cant help to be angry too.

I haven't been able to barley touch my baby, just looking at him makes me cry, its not his poor little fault but who's is? I'm not really a drinker, but i went to a couple events around the time i got pregnant, still i can't remember any moment i could have been drugged. did somone break into my house?

what if i never find out and my marriage is destroyed, if i can't fix this i don't know how i can take care of my son, i can't even look at him.

what do i do once i have to go back to work with him? Will i have to quit?

i dont even know what any of you can do but i feel like I'm drowning.

UPDATE: I'm still reading through all the responses, thank you so much. I had no idea i would get so much help and answers.

I've decided I'm going to send my husband this post, and ask for a paternity test. I'm hoping what you've said will convince him to come back to me. 

Many asking for updates, I'll try and come back when the test does. "

We’ve been together for 3 months and I had no idea that she held those beliefs. She’s always been a calm, “make love not war” kinda person and very kind to everyone. This is completely out of character and I’m still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a “dirty ass Jew”. I was shocked to say the least and didn’t even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are “extremely arrogant” and that they disgust her. 

For the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she’s Middle Eastern) so that’s just not something we ever brought up. 


She continued saying that you can’t trust Jews, that they’re all “rats” and that she’d rather die than associate with someone “so corrupt”. I asked her if that’s how she really feels and she said yes of course.


I still haven’t told her that I’m Jewish, I’m not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she’s an amazing girl and I’m ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. Any advice? 

**TL;DR My girlfriend went on an anti Semitic rant and explained how much she hates Jews. I’m Jewish, should I tell her and see how she responds or just move on?**"

Title may seem harsh so I apologize. Also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

Bit of background info about my wife: She’s an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. So to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

To make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. Of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. For the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch Netflix in bed. I brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least I could do.

But now it’s 7 months later and she’s still crying and watching Netflix in bed all day. I ask her every day if she needs anything but all I get in response is variations on either “leave me alone” or “some peace and quiet”. Virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I’ve suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. Therapy. She said that all therapists spew BS back at you.
2. Adoption or using a surrogate. She shot down both saying that it just didn’t feel right to her.
3. Moving to her parents’ city. She said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. Buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). She snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. Taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. Again, she said that’s too much stress.

Earlier tonight I had a talk with my wife. I told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. She said that she’s fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my wife with all my heart. I’m doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. I know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly I cannot bear living like this for much longer. What do (or can) I do?"

13.9K upvotes, 3.7K comments, more messages and DMs than I can count (Over 100 in each), *plus* being cross posted in two other subs was SO MUCH MORE than I had expected. I tried so hard to stay caught up, which proved to be impossible, then my thread was locked, so I gave up. I've spent the last month periodically logging in to this account and reading a few more messages/comments. I was determined to get through them all and I did! To those of you I never responded to, I am sorry. Please rest assure, I read every single thing that was sent to me.

You guys were right. You were telling me everything I already knew, but was ignoring for a multitude of reasons. Unless you live this life, you can't understand why the choices that are made are made. I could sit here and give you 1,000 excuses for why I've lived this life for so long, but they are just that... Excuses, so there's no reason to waste anyone's time.

ANYWAYS! As for the update...

It's been 31 days since my post and we all know what's been happening over the last 31 days... The apocalypse! But you know what? It's the best thing that could have happened for me in the moment. Every star I needed to align for me to get the necessary gonads did. First, school was closed for the rest of the year. Second, Husband was furloughed. Third, we were denied all assistance outside of $149/week in unemployment due to me making too much GROSS income, by less than $100 (Don't get me started on how fucking stupid that system is).

March 13th, which was the kid's final day at school, I approached him after the kids were in bed and said, ""Listen, Husband. For 11 years, I've done anything and everything you've wanted with complete disregard of my wants and needs. However, our kids depend on us to survive, so it is *literally* our job to make sure they have everything they need. With everything that's transpired and so much unknown in the future, I'm taking the job. This isn't about you. It's not even about me. It's about them"".

He told me that this was my choice and he understood why I felt like I needed to do it, but that he couldn't support me choosing money over family (Reminder: HIS family, my family is split between two completely unrelated states). I told him I loved him, I wanted him there, that my family isn't my family without him, and that the offer for him to come stands, should he choose to join us.

March 28th, the 3 of us began our next adventure. I found and secured a home before we left. We've spent the time since getting settled in and finding our new groove. I've been so busy, I haven't really been able to absorb the life changes that have taken place over the last 30 days. I miss him but I'm cut deep over this, so should he decide he wants to join us... I'm not sure I'll welcome that. I guess we will see if/when that time comes.

As far as the status of our relationship stands, I have no idea. We haven't discussed it. Time will tell, I suppose.

I did link up with a therapist though. That's been... Enlightening.

Thanks for the extra large dose of humble sauce, Reddit. I'm confident this wouldn't have panned out how it did without 3,700+ of you screaming my truth to me.

Stay safe out there. And, for the love of God, STAY THE FUCK HOME. :)

acowpy,"[32m] My wife [33f] will not shut up, and I'm not sure I can take it that much longer. Is it possible for that to be a reason to leave?",9534,0.94,1329,2019-01-05 06:25:44,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/acowpy/32m_my_wife_33f_will_not_shut_up_and_im_not_sure/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/acowpy/32m_my_wife_33f_will_not_shut_up_and_im_not_sure/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I'm not sure if I should have posted this on AITA instead.  But here goes: My wife will not shut up.  I'm not talking about your usual Chatty Cathy.  I mean she (almost) literally will NOT. SHUT. UP.  She will talk continuously from the moment she knows I am within earshot.  Not just in the same room.  I mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that I can hear her.  She will not *stop* talking until I'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  On more than one occasion, I've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before I went in.  She also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  So I get to hear ALL the bathroom noises on top of whatever Homeric Epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
I once drove from Tampa, FL to Chicago, IL with her (before we were married- I'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  She did not stop talking the entire way.  The ENTIRE way.  
  
Television on to a show I like?  Pfft.  That's not a problem.  She'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  Having sex?  That's the perfect time to tell me about how Olivia Newton John still has the leather pants she wore in Grease and she- brace yourself- STILL fits in them!  Really!  Needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  Ever.  I've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
I get it.  She grew up in a huge Italian Catholic family in the Bronx.  If you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  I, on the other hand, grew up in a Scandinavian family with two children.  To this day, I'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  I actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  I was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  She never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her I'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
That's not true, though.  Another difference between people of Swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  Other than the Minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  No ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  A nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  I think it has a lot to with living in the frigid North.  You keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
To her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  She's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did I just say?""  I've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  She'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and I'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if I had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  And she'll say ""yeah!"" and think I've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
I joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  Our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  Growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  And you talked loud so they didn't finish.  My son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  It got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  I didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now I know why Josh has a stutter.""  Just like that.  
  
She's failed at least one job interview because of this.  I know because I lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  He called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
We rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  She monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  Who wants more than one does of that?  
  
You're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  Yes.  Many times.  Sometimes jokingly.  Sometimes with utter seriousness.  The reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person I know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  The one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
I try not to let it get to me.  She's a very affectionate woman.  Loves me to death.  Mother of my child.  Pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  We still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but I'm pretty busy so I don't really notice as much).  But it *does* get to me.  It's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  There's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
I know the answer to the problem: I have to ""talk back.""  In effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  I would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  I would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  I would have to learn to use Italian Hand Gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  But I'm not Italian.  I'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
Twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  I'm not sure I can take it that much longer.  I'm just not sure if I could get a word in to tell the judge why I'm there in his divorce court.  My wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: Wife will not shut up.  Is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
EDIT: Obligatory Reddit ""omg I had no idea this would blow up.""  Which is true.  I thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  But RIP, Inbox.  It was nice to know ya.  So in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, I will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions I saw popping up multiple times.  
  
Also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
Q1 - Is this BS? (implied)  
A1 - No, it's all mostly true.  I admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  The bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  Not from sexy times, anyway.  She probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
Q2 - Why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was OP's wife hot?)  
A2 - Yes, she is hot.  And funny.  And vivacious.  Also, I really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/Sarah_Dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  And if I'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a LOT of things don't seem all that terrible.  [Damn you, Penis!  This is all your fault!]  
  
Q3 - Did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
A3 - Medically speaking, I cannot state this with 100% certainty.  The cause was never formally diagnosed.  However, I watched it happen first hand.  I'm not a qualified speech therapist, but I think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations I made.  I'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  Which leads to:  
  
Q4 - Aren't *YOU* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  After all, you did nothing to stop it.  
A4 - Guilty.  And I feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  For the record, I did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  But I think by the time I realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  And anything I could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  All the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  If there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and I'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
Q5 - Is it because she's (pick one: OCD, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
A5 - I don't think so, although I've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  I see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
Q6 - Have you tried counseling?  
A6 - No.  Probably should have, but I know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  It's bizarre that I can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, I've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  And yet, I'm seriously considering divorce.  I realize the contradiction there.  "

I am not allowed to post in relationships (mods told me I am not allowed to post an update thread there) so I got the advice from someone to post the update here instead. This is the post I posted about 2 hours ago on relationship. Will try my best to update it as time goes.

Here is my previous post for the people who did not read:

[CLICK HERE to see my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wod49/i_31m_found_out_my_fiance_cheated_during_her_30f/)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. I have had quite a few PM's regarding what happened and I got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. I want to let you all know that the support I have received has been incredible (both in PM and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

I am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the PM's, theres just too many to respond to but I would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

I would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, I tried to respond but I noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but I still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. Much love to you all.

I basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. I cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that I found out BEFORE i got married, with no children or attachments. I still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, I guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, I honestly dont know and dont care.

When I was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after I left reddit, she had woken up. She noticed the drinks out and asked me what I had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. I followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, I didnt want to give her any hint of what I knew. She asked my why I had been drinking and why I didnt come to sleep last night and I told her I was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. I felt detached, like I was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

She asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". She got herself done and left for work.

I basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. I planned on leaving things like furniture, TV and other things I really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. I just took the stuff most important to me so that I dont have to return here again. I dont care if she gets the rest. All in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

I called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and I really dont care at this point.

I also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

Around 1 pm I called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. I didnt leave any note or pictures at home, I just left. I am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

Around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 I start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

The only person I called back was my dad and mom. I have a huge trust for my parents, I basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. I told them its ended, and that I wont be getting married no more. I also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what I told them, I trust them alot so I am sure they wont say anything. I didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that I found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

Around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. I just told my dad not to intervene and that I need some alone time now.

I basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. Been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

I dont know if I should respond to them now or wait some more? Her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). I am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

Once again, thank you to everyone who replied. I will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, I know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. I hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

Time here is 10 pm soon.

TL;DR Found out my fiance cheated and I left without saying anything. Not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

EDIT 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

EDIT 2: Thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. I will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. I might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. I honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
Shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted."

I've known my wife since I was sixteen. I realize through reading this sub that I've been groomed. She moved me all the way across the country. 

We live on the eastern side of the US. I work in an office making great pay. She is a trust fund kid, so she obviously makes more than me. 

Our marriage has been horrible since we walked out of the church. She had my location on at all times and would question me daily. 

When I saw that she had been sending lewd messages to men and women online. I would ask her about it and she would tell me that I was seeing things. 

It all came to a head three days ago. I questioned my wife about the messages and this time I continued to press her and this time I got her phone. 

I didn't need to read much. There were pictures and messages about them having sex. I told that I had seen the messages and she snapped. 

She picked up our lamp and hit me in the face. The glass is thick so it didn't break. I tried to get up and she hit me again, this time right in my groin. 

I stayed down because if I had gotten up, I might have ended up writing this story behind bars. I laid there while my wife gathered some things and took off. 

I've taken PTO these last two days and I've just been reflecting. Should I have taken her phone? Did I misinterpret the messages? Can I fix this? Is it over?"

When we first initially met she had told me, but I was like naw can’t be that bad... boy was I wrong. 

Just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. Let’s talk dirty:

The kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. Dishes will pile up. Trash gets full. Unless I clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc I can’t stand the mess it will stay dirty. I have talked to her before about how I shouldn’t have to clean every single day, but she just doesn’t get it. 

Laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. She be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. Half the time I do her laundry and I have to ask her to fold it. If I don’t, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

Room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. She will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for DAYS. Things start to cultivate! 

Honestly, I have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn’t get it. I explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. Whenever I bring it up she gets annoyed. She will clean the day after I mention it and then never do it again until I bring it up AGAIN. Ugh. Advice, suggestions?


EDIT: WOW this really blew up! I just wanted a little advice so that I could hear different perspectives. Some of you provided great advice so I appreciate that! Will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us."

Update time.

So, I was awake late into the night after making the post and reading everyone's comments. I appreciate everyone who weighed in with something other than reminding me that I'm a horrible, fucked-up piece of shit as a person. I had come to that conclusion on my own but it was nice to have it verified. So, thanks.

I gave a lot of thought to the questions posed to me from  *helloiseeyou2020* and came to some conclusions.

I want to get better.

The day after posting I was visibly bothered by deep thoughts at work and one of my coworkers was concerned and asked me about what was bothering me. So... I told her the whole story. Together we looked into if my insurance would cover therapy. It does and even with COVID making it a video-chat-only kind of deal I started yesterday at lunch (Tuesday the 21st).

I decided to GTFO of the situation as well. I moved out of the house this past weekend and into a spare room that one of my coworkers offered for me to use until I can get some money together to relocate once the pandemic ends and I can get a transfer to a different branch. Hopefully out of state. This is awkward and life just took a crazy turn but I'm told that getting through this mess that I made will make me a better person in the end.

I spent Friday night down at the shore at my grandpa's house so I could be somewhere that I love and feel safe at for the next part:

I called Kate.

It went like anyone would expect. No lies. Worst conversation I've ever had. I told her when it was all said and done that I wasn't expecting her to ever forgive me as I don't know if I deserve it. She knows that I'm not there anymore and I'm going to try my hardest to put as much distance as possible between me and her family ASAP. I ended the call by telling her that I won't be initiating contact any more. I'm going to give her all the space and time that she needs, even if that means I'll never talk to her again.

I really do love her more than life itself and I hope that we can eventually recover but I doubt we will.

This is my own fault and I'm trying to take accountability, here.

Thanks for the input, everybody.

axya38,My (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated I won't talk to her,9341,0.96,585,2019-03-06 17:56:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axya38/my_24f_coworker_50f_blamed_me_for_my_miscarriage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/axya38/my_24f_coworker_50f_blamed_me_for_my_miscarriage/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Exactly what the title says. My coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because I was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( I took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why I'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but I'm coming and going 'as I please'.


Me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that I had a miscarriage. Her response? 'I told you you were pregnant! Why the hell are you here? You need to be home! This is why you had the miscarriage! You don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. What is wrong with you? You are being so stupid! You don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. Come on, really. Who do you think you're telling this to? I'm a woman! I have gone through things like this! Don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. Honestly, take care of yourself. '


And then with that she announced she was going on break and I sobbed in the bathroom. I pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. Then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but I've moved desks. I'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. Today she tried to send me a birthday gift and I refused. She is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. She also tried to coordinate breaks with me. I, of course, insisted that I break at a different time. 

This is making her frustrated and I am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why I no longer want to engage socially with her. I am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. How do I explain to her I don't want to be friends with her anymore? Is there a way I can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

TLDR: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why I didn't get in trouble, I explained that I miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that I shouldn't be surprised if I can't get pregnant again. Now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset I didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

Update: First, thanks for the support. I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


Second, she ended up submitting a false report saying I interrupted her work day and withheld important information. It is false. I have witnesses, I was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. I will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier."

It's 11:09pm on February 13th. Less than an hour until Valentine's Day. And my boyfriend of 7 years, who I had big plans with for tomorrow, just texted me out of nowhere and said our relationship is over. No explanation, nothing. Then he blocked my number and all social media accounts. Needless to say, I'm super confused and completely devastated. How am I supposed to survive Valentine's Day? It's always been our day. We've always done something big and extravagant because Valentine's day is our anniversary. And I just feel crushed. Some people have suggested I have a girls night, but I don't have really any friends that live near me. And I really don't want to have a night to myself, it just feels so cold and lonely. Any advice?

Edit: forgot to mention, not that it's super important to this specific situation, but him and I have a 2 year old son together. So it's not just me that this is going to effect, it's going to impact our son's life too.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. I'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. And we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before Christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by January 1st. It was such short notice, and right at Christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. He lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. So he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

Edit 3: My son was only in this post so people could understand that I'm not just being a whiny bitch because I got dumped. I'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. And please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. That was my decision, not yours. Oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. We got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and I weren't around. We live in NY where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. So I'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted."

He recently came home with a toddler and claimed it was his cousin’s secret child and we had to watch her for a few days until his wife calmed down and they could get the stuff they needed for her. He said it would be good practice for us for when our little one arrived. I thought this was weird, but his cousin sent me a text verifying his story and I wasn’t going to throw a toddler out, so I just went along with it. Besides we already had our nursery set up, so we had the space for her. 

Well, a few days turned into a week, a week turned into two, and two turned into a month. I’m currently 8 months and could pop at any moment so we need our nursery back. I finally sat my husband down and told him he had to get his cousin to come pick his daughter up because we would need the nursery soon. He kept insisting they just needed another week or two, but he was acting weird and I had a bad feeling. I asked him if there was something, he wasn’t telling me, and he denied denied denied. Until I told him this was his one chance to tell me the truth and if it came out later, I would divorce him immediately. 

He admitted he had cheated on me and the little girl is his from a ONS, her mother recently passed away and he was contacted to take custody, or she would’ve been put into foster care. He said he couldn’t do that to her. He kept saying he was sorry, and it meant nothing. I just sat there, feeling numb. He said he wants us to raise her together as our little girl and since our baby is a boy this was perfect because we could get the best of both worlds. 

I’m currently staying at my sister’s and I just feel so numb. I keep expecting the tears to come and they haven’t. My husband keeps texting me begging me to come home. He says he needs me and he can’t do this by himself and he loves me more than anything. That’s obviously a lie. He wouldn’t have done this to me if he loved me.

I just don’t know what the hell I’m going to do. This is such a mess.

What do I do now?

TL;DR – my husband has a child from a ONS. He brought her home and claimed it was his cousin’s daughter but once I put pressure on him he admitted she was his. I don’t know what the hell I’m going to do now."

My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. She stays at my house about 75% of the time. We have had no major problems before this point.

On Saturday night, we were watching TV in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. My immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, I found that it was the police.

At this point I was extremely confused. I don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. I have no firearms in the house. I do nothing illegal online; I don't even pirate Game of Thrones. I had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a Saturday night.

I opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. I asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. In turn, I refused to give them permission. My girlfriend repeatedly said I should cooperate. I said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. They then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what I thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

The first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and I into separate rooms and begin questioning us. I kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local PD is backwater and shitty enough. 

I refused to answer any questions. I told them I wanted a lawyer if I was under arrest. I repeated that I did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you Breaking Bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

My girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. I didn't hear much because she was in the next room but I overheard her say this:

>You should check the back yard shed! I've never been in there before and I can't say what's in it...

At the time I could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" Well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, I'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. At that point I asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

I don't need legal advice. My mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. She's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. I'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""I panicked and didn't know what to do."" What I need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their S/O under the bus like that.

Does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

\-----

 

Two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

She asks me to go to therapy with her. She was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. That sounded a little weird to me, I thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

Also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. I have never met her therapist. So to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

The day comes, and I go there. But out of self preservation, I had my phone opened and recording any audio.

My fiance was already there. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was invited in. The therapist greets me and shakes my hand. We have small talk. She tells me I am not at all the way my fiance described me. I think she is trying to compliment me. Then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

That absolutely weirded me out. But I am a calm and collected individual, and I don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

So the therapist starts talking. Has a small speech I don't care to repeat. My fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

I smile, I am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind I am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. Modern woman and girl power and all that.

Nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

The other non-traditional type of marriage. I forgot it's 2018.

But she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

Because she would be too heart broken knowing that I find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

So I let them finish talking. They were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because I wasn't saying anything. This was definitely something they have rehearsed.

I then asked the therapist if she is licensed. This, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. She said yes. So I told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

I wished them good luck, and left the office.

Now, I want to report the therapist. I am not sure if I have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? I don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and I want her to pay for the misconduct. That ""session"" did not sit well with me.

To be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. Even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where I could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. That's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

It also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. Now that I have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

So I was a fool anyway.

I listened to the recording, and I still can't believe what was said there.

Anyway, I called off the wedding.

I am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because I am not seeking them. There are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. That might have given my ex the impression I will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. Having listened to the recording a few times, I am confident the therapist recognized I am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

Now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions I am not comfortable answering.

How do I navigate this sea?

I am sure my ex is doing damage control, but I have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, I will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

But my parents and family also want answers, and I am not sure what BS to tell them. I don't want them to think I am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

She is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""We can work on this"", ""I didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

Last cry of a dying siren. All her cries fall on deaf ears, and I am the owner of said ears.

We were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but I cancelled everything.

I basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

Her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. I had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

Regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once I figure out where to do it, and what to say.

This post is mostly a rant, but I would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. My Ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and I don't want to be a he said / she said. I do have the recording, and am wondering if I should send it to the interested parties.

My ex doesn't know I have the recording."
14c0udv,I (21F) found a spy camera in my room after my step dad (36M) put a surveillance camera in my window,9280,0.96,985,2023-06-18 01:57:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14c0udv/i_21f_found_a_spy_camera_in_my_room_after_my_step/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"My stepdad (36M) installed a surveillance camera positioned outside of my window to scan our backyard while him and my mother and two younger brothers go camping. I couldn’t go on the trip since i had work, so i was staying home to house sit and feed our animals. My stepdad recently put up new cameras outside so I didn’t see anything wrong with him positioning one outside my window. Come to find out the very next day, I had my boyfriend stay over and he found that the surveillance camera that was ran from outside my window and into my room was being powered by one of those spy camera power blocks. 

For context, my relationship with my stepdad hasn’t always been the best and we tend to butt heads a lot. He’s said a lot of questionable things in the past that i’ve written off because he’s my dad and i would never think he intended to be inappropriate or harmful. He’s been in my life since i was 8 years old. Of course I’m second guessing everything now that i’ve found this camera. It was positioned to point directly at my bedroom door from the far wall, so it has direct view of my entire room, which i change in. 

I tried desperately to rationalize it and think it was maybe a mistake, like he grabbed the wrong charger box. Or maybe he was just trying to look for intruders. But really there is no excuse for putting a camera in MY bedroom. the camera even had an SD card in it. I’m beyond devastated. My stepdad even suggested i invite my boyfriend over to while they’re gone so i have someone here, which is something he would never do considering he’s made it clear before he doesn’t want him over when no one is home because he doesn’t want us ‘fucking in his home’. My boyfriend and I are going to go through the SD card to see if there is anything on it.

I’m at a complete loss at how to even bring this up to my mom. I confided in my aunt and uncle since they live close by and they have been very supportive of me having a conversation with my mom about it. This whole situation is extremely upsetting, I at least have some family to support me as i navigate this but i don’t even know how to bring this up to my mom. This is obviously going to change everything. She had my five year old half brother with him. 

My mind is racing with the consequences this is going to have on our family. Has anyone that has been in a similar situation have advice? How can i do this without causing extreme damage to the family (although that may be impossible). Thank you in advance.

TLDR; i found a hidden camera that my stepdad put in my room, how do i bring this up to my mom?

UPDATE(1/?):

I don’t want to make a whole new thread since i want to make a new update when my parents get back monday, but i want to thank everyone for all the advice. i went to the police station tonight and filed a police report and turned in the spy camera with the SD card. The officer said this is a serious offense and i will likely get a call early next week from an investigator due to the severity of the situation. I’m planning on telling my mother about the police report after we have a conversation about this on monday, with my aunt and uncle present. 

As for people messaging me about my profile: thank you for reminding me to delete personal information. Please please do not dox or try to seek any sort of justice for me as this may affect my case. Respect my privacy during this time please as it may be crucial during this investigation.

This was the hardest thing i ever had to do, but whatever this shit was, it’s ending with me. I hope i can get justice for myself and any other victims who may have been violated by him since this will be heavily investigated and the officer said it will likely be looked into further (such as search warrants and looking for more SD cards). i’m hanging on by a thread but the support i have is what’s keeping me together. i’m staying with my boyfriend tonight to keep out of the house. Thanks again for all the love and supportive messages. I’ll update again soon.

UPDATE (2/?)

it’s the next morning and once my boyfriend wakes up we’re going back to my house today to look for any more secret cameras (either in the bathroom or my brothers rooms) so i can submit it for more evidence. i’m iffy about searching my parents room for more evidence as it’s likely he has a hidden camera in there to see me do it. still on the fence about having a police officer search the house, if i do i’ll be sure to update after i’m finished and in a safe place. my aunt has offered to come with me to help me search.

again, thank you everyone for the support. i’m trying as best i can to do this the right way and get as much done with the time i have left. i’m mentally and emotionally drained but i’ll be seeking resources once all of this is said and done. i’m reading everyone’s comments so i’m taking all the advice i can get.

UPDATE (3/?)

i probably won’t be able to update for a few days since today is the day that i talk to my mom, but i just wanted to share the plan i made and hopes for what happens today.

after talking with my aunt, uncle, boyfriend, and my cousin who is a civil lawyer, i’ve decided that i will speak to my mom in a separate location from my stepdad. most likely i’ll have her meet me somewhere outside of our home. i’ll have my aunt with me and this is where i’ll explain everything to her: the camera, past uncomfortable experiences i’ve had with my stepdad that i originally brushed off because he was my dad, video footage of him deliberately setting it up and angling it, and footage of me in my room. im praying she understands why i had to go to my aunt instead of her considering she was not in town and i was worried for her safety if i told her what happened. (she was stuck with him and my brothers about 4 hours away for the weekend) 

i’m hoping with my aunt there and her being away from my stepdad that it’ll prevent her from reacting out of anger and search for him and escalate the situation then and there, and i hope my aunt can provide some support for myself and her. i’m prepared for her to go through the same processes i went through such as reasoning and denial, but with the evidence there’s no possible way she can deny it. i’m preparing myself for the worst. i just hope that i can be strong for her and support her as this all hits her like it did me. 

i will not be returning home or facing him today. my boyfriend will be on standby to pick up my brothers if needed since my aunt has offered for them to stay with us so my mom can talk to my stepdad without them there. i’ll ask my mom to meet me and of course, not tell my stepdad about the circumstances. maybe she can tell him she’s going to the grocery store. i don’t want him getting any hints that she could be meeting
with me. 

i know i’ve said it a lot but i truly do appreciate the support system i have not only with my family but here too. this has been a nightmare but hearing everyone’s stories about this, proving it’s way too common, is what is helping me get through this and pushing me to do the right thing. not only am i a victim in this but my boyfriend as well and god knows who else. the confrontation won’t happen for about another 7 hours so i’m the meantime i’ll be reading over comments and preparing myself for what comes today. thank you guys."
a4n1gj,I (21f) had sex with a guy I met on Tinder last night (25m). To me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me I took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. What in the hell do I do?,9268,0.89,1799,2018-12-09 23:32:56,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4n1gj/i_21f_had_sex_with_a_guy_i_met_on_tinder_last/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a4n1gj/i_21f_had_sex_with_a_guy_i_met_on_tinder_last/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"I guess some background is in order, I met this guy on Tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on Wednesday and agreed to meet again on Saturday. I did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

So last night we had a great time. We ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. The sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again I had no idea he wasn't into it. So after finishing I was just telling him hat I really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

At first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. I was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. Then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what I had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that I knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. I told him that I was really sorry but I saw it differently. He ended up getting dressed and ran out. He was crying so loud and so intently I could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

He drove away and I haven't heard anything from him at all. I am so lost as to what to do. 

1. Should I call him and apologize? Even though I feel I didn't do anything wrong?

2. Should I call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. Should I just Swayze him and say I've dodged a bullet?

4. Should I actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


Thank you so much for the help!! I'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy I met on Tinder. I'm lost as to what to do next?
 

Edit as of 840 AZ time: he just called me. He was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that and very confused. He kept trying to goad me into talking and I asked sort of joking “what are you recording me or something?” and then he hung up. Something tells me I stepped in a HUGE pile of shit. My dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

Well if I become the first female #metoo you saw it here first. 

Edit2: you pathetic little mgtows and MRA Incels can stop saying ""if the genders were reversed"" or see this as some sort of ""get em guys"" cause celeb. It's been said already. Morons.


So awesome This post is bringing out the best of everyone in private…

I wanted to speak about things in person.

I didn't want to go in all accusatory so I just started to say how I feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). I talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

How ""Cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. Just a source of entertainment and that upset me. They let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. There is ALWAYS a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. It's like a show. I thought it was a coincidence until I knew it was kinda...orchestrated? Black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. Not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. I told him that I didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. But I talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. He listened to me the entire time without jumping in and I've never had someone do that before so I appreciated it.

He spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. That's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. But never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. He sees things differently than I do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. Also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. But you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. Then we talked about why we were with each other and I won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

Then we started talking about the ""Drip or drown"" for guys and **""If she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

We both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. He was Frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. But the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. At the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. It's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

His dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. It offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. Plus, they're just fun to be in.

So everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

Also people got so mad because I called myself pretty. Women are told to accept compliments all the time, but I do it...it makes me conceited? I'm hella pretty and I know it. Stay mad.

But to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**Edit: Guys I read the comments and I'm more confused...I really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. He listened to me and I thought all I could do is wait until I see if he follows up. He seemed genuine and I do give him the benefit of the doubt. But maybe I shouldn't...Idk here.**

**I've never dated outside my race and I have mostly black friends, so I've never been in this position before. I came here to get different opinions and I did. I guess what I'll do now is watch closely. I really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**"
cxg0pn,(Update to) I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,9242,0.94,249,2019-08-30 17:38:40,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxg0pn/update_to_i_32m_was_going_to_propose_to_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxg0pn/update_to_i_32m_was_going_to_propose_to_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,,False,"I was thinking I'd edit the original post, but I decided I'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. Since the original post really blew up I don't think too many people would see an edit, so I'm making a new post instead.

I took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the OBGYN visit. The IUD was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. However, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. It's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. I ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. Eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

Normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. We sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. Eventually the sun began to set and I decided it was time. I started to say I had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. She told me she understood so I skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. After we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (I knew she used reddit but I didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. She said she would have preferred I proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

Although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, I am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. We're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. We're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

These past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. Thanks for helping me get over my worries.

edit: eptopic -> ectopic.

Edit 2: marriage license -> certificate."

My wife (F58) and I disagree about it, and I could use some advice",9219,0.98,722,2020-02-08 17:04:30,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f0qhj3/my_m61_adopted_son_m14_wants_to_live_with_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f0qhj3/my_m61_adopted_son_m14_wants_to_live_with_his/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I used a Throwaway account and fake names for privacy reasons...

My wife, Jane, and I are married 25 years, with a soon-to-be 15 year old son, John, we adopted as an infant after years of unsuccessfully trying to get pregnant. 

John has known he's adopted since a very young age. Three years ago we let him see his adoption file and told him what little we knew about his biological parents. John became obsessed with finding them, and within a month we found their information online. His birth mother died in 2009. His biological father, Sam, is married with two young daughters. He was 16 when my son was conceived. 

We made contact. After DNA testing confirmed Sam's paternity, he and his family were very receptive, and a reunion soon followed. Sam is a great guy and he and John have built a close bond over the past two years. We live about an hour away. Sam and John now frequently hike and fish/hunt, play sports and do things that I am not as fit or inclined to do (Sam is half my age; my health is poor). John gets along great with his new sisters, and joined their 10 day family vacation to Hawaii over the holidays.

Last week John asked us if he could move in with Sam's family. He wasn't callous or cruel about it. He had a whole speech written out, and delivered it through tears. Basically he said he loves us and will always be grateful, but that he is happier with Sam's family. He wants to live with them and spend a few weekends each month with us. He had spoken to Sam, who is open to discussing it with us. Apparently Sam's wife is all for it too.

The last two years have been difficult for my wife and I for other reasons. Jane's business went bankrupt and her mother passed away. We've both been depressed. My diabetes took two of my toes and I'm likely to lose half the foot soon. I can understand why John would want to live with Sam, in a house filled with activity and positive happenings.

Jane is absolutely against John moving out. She is insulted and hurt and angry. She is astounded at me for even considering it. She said we have been too focused on ourselves and too willing to let Sam and his family fill roles we find difficult or impossible. I think that's overly harsh but I do see her point.

In the long run I just want what's best for John. Sam is financially secure, young and healthy, with a sweetheart of a wife. They live in a better neighborhood, with a much better high school. I can think of so many reasons why living with them makes sense; most of the reasons I think of for him to stay under our roof seem selfish.

I would appreciate some advice on where we go from here. It's all very confusing right now and I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of a no-win situation"

Thank you.

So the title is fairly self explanatory as to what happened.
He doesn't know I know, because obviously I woke up.

Anyway, to set the scene a little. (Or a lot reading this back)

(Let's call him J) 
J and I have been friends for around 9 years now, we always got on really well at school and had the same sense of humor and life views.
When we were 16-17 I finally got round to asking him if he was gay, he hadn't come out yet but it was painfully obvious.
He never came out to me because he was afraid of the way I would react, if I would distance myself. Which I tried my best not to, the catch was he admitted he was in love with me.
We stayed much the same for the rest of school.
I'd be lying if I said I didn't occasionally have the lingering thought that he loved me however...

As we became older and could drink legally (18 in the UK) we would go out on the piss and end up blind drunk.
So I'm unaware of a lot, however I was told by a few other close and oldest friends that he was in love with me. Which of course I told them I already knew that.
The thing I was unaware of was that he was quite... Handsy with me, nothing too major but J would place his hand on my thigh or slap my ass. I always pointed out when he slapped my ass and told him to stop that. (He still occasionally does)

As a result of being told that I began to drink less with him, he didn't slow down and I could see for myself that J was far far to comfortable. I'm really not the kind of guy that likes contact at the best of times, so for me it would make me flinch.
I also noticed how whenever we would talk about relationships J would floor me with compliments and how fit I am or how nice my legs are etc (I work a manual job and exercise but I'm nothing special) or how he would comment on the other guys in the bar, kind of like how guys do to girls.

Okay now skip forwards a fair amount, I'd say 2 years to current date. A fairly consistent pattern has arisen, whenever we go out and he drinks too much we finish up sat on a bench somewhere with me trying to console him and him telling me he has nothing except me and another very close friend of his, and how he doesn't know how he would go on without me.
The last time this happened was because we were with a few friends and the topic of relationships came up. I specifically avoid my own around him, but this time I slipped and said about my intimacy with my last train wreck relationship.
He basically just up and left, so it all came to a stop and we went out to find him. We did and he was fine, but yet again he was telling me how much he loved me and that I hurt him by saying what I did.

Skip about 2 hours on. I slept in his room with his other closest friend,. Set up a kinda mattress thing, we weren't in the same bed. He always says to sleep in the same bed but I categorically refuse. Damn good thing too.
During the night; I've no idea what time, I wake up and my legs feel pretty cold, so I roll the blanket back over them, didn't get up or anything. Then I swear I felt the blanket moving, I looked but was still asleep and still really pissed. But I'm sure I saw J laying on the floor at the bottom of the set-up.
As I was drunk and asleep I was weirded out but wasn't 100% sure so decided to ignore it.
Nothing more happened except the noise of him masturbating... Now that's a noise you can't sleep to.

Time skip yet again to recently.
J and I went out to the pub for a meal and a couple of drinks, it was a pleasant evening, we went back to his and watched a movie.
Time for bed... This is where shit gets fucked up for me. And this is the hardest bit to write, because of all the things I never thought to happen to me, especially from him...

I go to sleep like normal, I wake up, the cover is moving again... This time I remember last time and don't ignore it...
I lay there, face down is how I sleep.
The covers lift from my legs, then they move a bit further up and come off at my thighs. At this point I know exactly what's happening. He's leaning over the front of the bed looking... 
It gets worse as he decided I was infact asleep, and he reached for my underwear. When his hand got hold of the elastic I rolled myself over as hard as I possibly could and made a bunch of noise. But I didn't ""wake-up""...

After pulling the covers back onto myself I waited half an hour, and was starting to pass back out. I fell asleep.
Then I woke up, I was on my back... His hand was... His hand was exactly where you're thinking it was. 
It was in my underwear, it was pulling on my penis... I froze up, I shut my eyes tight for probably 10 seconds and then came to my senses. I turned to the side, I tried not to make it look like I'd woken up, I lay there, until he finally relented and rolled back up the bed...
From 5 am I didn't sleep a wink and had to listen to him furiously masturbating over and over...
I couldn't get up and go because he would know, and I was still under some influence of alcohol, so couldn't drive.

I waited until 9:30 and got up, he was awake and we said good morning, I said I was off and had to go to work (it was true I work 7 days a week) I left... Got home, puked a few times and had a bath...

Usually I would be the guy who turns his face into pulp. And I would if I wasn't careful...
But more my question is what exactly am I supposed to do.
I know I should report it but I can't do that to him.
And he just might do something stupid to himself if he knew.

P.S -- I have always been a reddit stalker, looking at all these posts thinking ""wow that's fucked up imagine that"" while eating popcorn. Well look at me now! I made it!

TL:DR - skip the first 3 paragraphs, I can't short word it sorry. It's the title.

Thanks in advance if you take the time to read this and it gets noticed. I just needed somewhere to say it."

J and G are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. They would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. However, i'm not really a sports person but still I would make the effort to attend their games. I would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. J plays football and G plays soccer.

J was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. I know its wrong to snoop but I couldn't help it. Some his teammates were messaging him and I clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging G. I got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited G out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. G would decline and tell him that he should invite me. J then said that I wouldn't understand and that I was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. G said that he is being unfair to me. J still sends multiple messages to G about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

This has been going on for months. G has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that I should watch because those are J's favorite teams.

I kinda feel betrayed by both of them. Although I feel more betrayed by J than G.

What should I do? How should I approach this?

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for your advice. I approached G first and told her that I've seen the messages. She was relieved that I came to her and talked to her about it. She explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. She also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. We both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

I also have to admit that snooping through J's messages are wrong. The reason I did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and I was feeling insecure and worried about it. But it still does not justify the way I went about it.

As for J, we will meet up later tonight. I honestly think it is over between us. He also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. I would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

Thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**UPDATE 2**: G told me that I should start by saying ""Hey, G told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and I did exactly that. J became defensive and told me that he never invited her. I told him that I saw the messages and he asked if G showed me the messages. I told him the truth that I saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. He told me that I violated his privacy and I apologized for it. Then he told me that he was asking out G because his friends felt that G was a lesbian. He was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. At this point I'm like ""WHAAAAAT?!"". He said that he was doing that to protect me and I'm like WHAT?. He then left and told me that he needed space and that I should text him after I got my head cleared up. I texted him ""stay away from me and G"". That was honestly a wild ride."
i7f1k2,My Fiance's ex sent me their sex tapes and I made the terrible mistake of watching it,9157,0.98,1019,2020-08-11 03:48:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i7f1k2/my_fiances_ex_sent_me_their_sex_tapes_and_i_made/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"My fiance (27M) and I (29F) just got engaged a week ago. I proposed to him when I heard from our friends that he was sad that his proposal plans were ruined by covid. We have been very happy this past week.

I guess this caught the attention of his bitter ex (28F). She contacted me on SM and sent me a few videos and said that even though I maybe marrying him, I would never be able to satisfy him sexually the way she did.

For some background, early on in our relationship I was a bit insecure about this ex especially how attractive she was, but my fiance assured me that he would never ever consider being with her again, because she was abusive and used to force him into things he did not like. I soon grew out of these insecurities because my fiance was an amazing bf and always made me feel loved and very secure.

But the ex's message brought back all these insecurities and I decided to watch the videos she sent. It was a huge mistake. I have never seen my fiance so passionate/vocal during sex with me. She even had a video of her giving him a bj in a public place, I never knew he was into all that stuff.

I got really upset and decided to check if he had kept any of these videos on his phone. Turns out he hadn't kept any of them, but I found out messages discussing them with his best friend Sarah. Apparently his ex had sent these tapes to him as well to remind him how good it was between them. He had deleted them right away and blocked her, but was debating whether or not to tell me about this, and thus asked Sarah's advice.

The conversation somehow turned into Sarah asking who was better sexually, my fiance tried to evade the question but she pressed the issue for some reason. It looked like she was teasing him and was being playful, but after a while he got mad and sent her a mini rant. The important gist of it was basically this:

> If you look at it from a purely physical perspective, then yeah (ex) was better. She was more my type physically and sexually. She was very aggressive and passionate and always took the initiative which I liked, and she gave one hell of a bj. But she was also abusive and towards the end, she started using sex as a tool, and instead of feeling loved it became a desperate attempt for me to connect with her.

> Sex with (ThrowRAsadfiance2020) made me realize that sex was not just about the physical aspect. I feel loved and secure and happy when I am with her. Even if she is less my type compared to (ex) the emotional connection means that the sex is automatically great.

Although the second half of his rant somehow saves it, I still feel really hurt by his admission that sex was better with her. He did tell me that he liked me being aggressive and taking initiative, and I do try to be more like that, but once things start happening I end up becoming more passive and let him take the lead. I know I can try being more aggressive, but I am afraid I can never be as good as her  and I can never be the kind of girl that can give public bjs. Now I wonder if he settled for me despite not enjoying sex as much with me.

Logically, I know I don't have to be the best at everything for my fiance. But it hurts because he is the best bf I have ever had in all aspects that I can think of and I always thought our sex life was amazing. Now I feel like I just got lucky because I was the first person he dated after that abusive pos and the bar was set so low that he decided that our relationship was amazing enough to make up for that I was not as good at sex as she was.

I feel sad and hurt and I don't know what to do, the ex managed to ruin what was supposed to be one of the happiest period of my life. I don't know how to bring this up to my fiance without sounding like a nut with no self control who thought it was a good idea to watch the videos and snoop on his phone.

Okay so I am a huge Marvel nerd. The kind of nerd that Cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. Mostly fanservice.

My sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". She claims I am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

Besides that we have a good relationship. We are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

So 3 years ago I managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the USA and meet the real Stan Lee! He signed one of my own pictures I did of the big 3 and complimented it. It's was one of the best days of my life.
Since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

Flash forward. A few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and I tell her no. Reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. She pouted and I left the house.

When I come back is see my fucking Stan Lee autograph ripped up on the flor! I fucking lost it. Then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). When she saw that I was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that I can get a new one.

I pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. She tries to engage in conversation but I shoot her down. She tries to bribe me with movie tickets and I tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. She hasn't apologized for it. She just says that I should be over it by now.

My mom says the same. She says a materialistic things shouldn't come In between family and that I should simply let it go. My dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. He is as big on Marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. This whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

My mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and I think they both disrespected me. Mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

I feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. Can somone help me with this?

Edit :thanks guys for listening to me. I feel a lot better. I will take what many of you said and I am going to send them examples of how much Stan Lee's autograph costs. But I think I have to word it very good so that they don't think that I would ""split up the family over money""

Update : Thanks for the support. My dad and I found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. Dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment. As you can imagine sister threw a fit and is staying with mom at my grandparents now."
hu001d,(UPDATE) I had to kick my girlfriend out of my house because she was scaring my brother.,9155,0.98,362,2020-07-19 18:20:39,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu001d/update_i_had_to_kick_my_girlfriend_out_of_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hu001d/update_i_had_to_kick_my_girlfriend_out_of_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hello everyone, I would like to thank you all for your time and of course for commenting on my original post and would like to thank you all a lot for your advices.

The Original post: [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hskukg/i_had_to_kick_my_girlfriend_out_of_my_house/)

I would like to start by saying that I decided to get in contact again with my girlfriend, and I decided to talk to her. Of course I didn't let her back into my home and I wanted to talk on any other place than there, she called me to go to her house.

I started by asking her where did she get the ""advice"" that she saw on the internet that said that scaring blind people was a good thing to be done. She was very reluctant to tell me, but when I pressured her a little more she ended up telling me. Apparently there's is no article, no research, no elaborated study, nothing... The advice she got came from a friend of hers on facebook chat, and she just went along with it. She also told me she lied about her mother telling her that, to clarify, her mother is a social worker where we live, so she thought that if she said that her mother had also said that it would maker her ""friend"" advice a little more credible because she couldn't find any article or study. I tried to ask her about why would she think that her friend advice was good when she could nothing to corroborate it, she didn't want to answer.

I asked her them why would she ignore me when I told her to stop and kept scaring my brother. She told me that she didn't thought that I would find it that bad, and that if I really loved her I would just ignore it because she was trying to help and that she feels that I don't love her because I would choose my brother over her just because now he is a ""crippled"" (her own words) on something so ""trivial"", and that he should grow up and deal with his problems himself, and I as her girlfriend should be on her side allways. Of course I was very angry at this answer and we ended up getting on another fight. On her words I shouldn't have asked my brother to come live with me, but as I ended up asking he should just be quiet and obey and accept what we do because we ""know better"" for being adults.

Before going to her house I took some people advice and I decided to ponder abour our relationship until that moment. And looking back I could see a lot of things I believe I didn't want to see. First, every single approach on our relationship was taken by me... want a date? I was the one inviting her, let's go see a movie? I allways had to be the one to invite, romantic time? I had to start allways, looking back the entire relationship look's one sided... Second, she doesn't look like she care much about ""boundaries"" from the start, she disregarded every single boundarie I've had before, I never took much action about them because they were small things, I believe that if I had made myself more clear before it wouldn't get to a point where it would cause problems to my brother.

I made a decision, I didn't want to break up, but if we were to continue a relationship with her, all of this would have to change. I talked with her and told her that I didn't want to break up, but if we were to continue a relationship, first she would not be allowed near my brother and wouldn't be welcome to my house when my brother is there, second she would have to apologise to him and promise and this time respect that promise, that what was done wouldn't happen again, and third she would have to go to counseling with me. Those where my terms and if we were to continue together things had to change.

She got mad at me, cursed me, told me I was and idiot to choose family over her, and that I was crazy to end a relationship over this, I talked with her about those things I mentioned earlier and she call me stupid, that this is what a ""good relationship"" look's like. Of course we got on another fight.

In the end she wasn't willing to compromise and make the relationship work. So, I decided to end things... yep we broke up, of course I left her house being called a lot of names, I blocked her on both my cellphone and social media, and right now I'm focusing on my brother. It hurts a lot that the person that I've been calling the love of my life recently could be that cold but I guess it was for the better.

A lot of you recommended therapy and counseling for my brother, he is already on it. Before coming to my house he already was on it.

I would like to thank you all for advice, I don't think I would have ever looked back at my own relationship if I haven't got to that point and I don't think it would be safer to continue in that relationship anymore, she already disregarded boundaries with me, I didn't do nothing about it, and it got to a point where it ended affecting very bad my brother and I feel very guilt for that.

Thank you all for your help, and for your kind words of confort

Edit: It look's like a lot of people are misreading or didn't see on my original post, I am also a woman, and my girlfriend is a woman as well."

We’re trying to keep it small, 50 to 60 people and honestly I have no relationship with the cousin I speak of. But I made it clear to my mom as she was asking me about other family members that he absolutely was not to be there.

My cousin showed up to my three year olds birthday party high as a kite. Falling asleep standing up and looking like absolute shit. My aunt brought him. I was absolutely bullshit that she would bring him around not only my kids but her own grandchildren as well. He has stolen money at almost every family gathering we’ve ever had. 

Why the hell is my family mad at me for it? I don’t want my kids around that and I damn well don’t want the topic of our wedding to be what is wrong with my cousin? 

What do I even say to everyone?"

I took the advice in the comments and confronted him in front of his family by making a „joke“. At first there was silence till his brother made up a fake laughter to calm the situation as you literally could feel the tension. My husband just gave me a poisonous look and didn’t say anything. Later at home it became a huge fight were he hold a speech about his „role as man“, „his proud“ and that I were unable to be a „good ,caring wife who supports her husband“.
As I didn’t shut up this time he told me to fuck off. I took a few things of mine and went to my parents‘. I can’t believe that he changed to this person as I met him as a open minded man. And I can’t believe we were trying to have a baby together. I’m glad I could opened my eyes before it went that far. I’m going to divorce. My parents are thinking that it’s a temporary situation but I don’t wanna risk a life in abuse and handcuffs.
Thank you all for your advices!"

&#x200B;

The same thing happened a second time the day after I posted that, so I went along with the suggestion of filming myself while I sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever I napped during the day/evening.

&#x200B;

Long story short it clearly is my brother, I've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. I have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if I should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didnt expect so much advice! I'm going to read everything. And for those asking, my brother's a year younger than me. So I'm quite worried about having the video at all for the reasons some people pointed out.

&#x200B;

2nd Edit: I want to thank everyone for giving advice, even if a lot of people seem to be arguing about what's best and how serious it is etc. Some very calm sounding people have suggested I speak to my brother before anything else, so I'm going to do that. I know some others have warned not to do this, but I think its important to speak to him first. If it goes badly with him then I can still speak to my parents or someone else, but if I speak to them first I can't undo it.

I'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - I'm 14, he's 13. As for why I 'let him do it a second time', well I do still have to sleep, and I kept recording myself until I made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. Also a lot of people asking how I know what semen smells like. How do you think? Calm down and stop calling me names."

I understand some people don’t like their partners body count and it can be a deal breaker in some cases but my boyfriend asked me what my body count was and told me not to lie to him and I was completely honest to him. My body count is more than 10 but less than 20, not going to be completely specific and he got upset right away and stated since I’m a woman I should hold myself to a higher standard. He has said that woman who are promiscuous deserve to be treated like “thots” and I got offended about that. He thought that I’m overreacting for getting offended at him telling me that. We ended up making up and moving on and he doesn’t mistreat me often but he has showed signs he doesn’t trust me as much since that whole conversation, like he constantly needs to see my location now.

Edit: He did specify that I wasn’t a ‘thot’ and he wasn’t calling me one. He says that he can respect woman but not thots. He says that it’s his opinion and I was weird for being offended. But I will be rethinking our relationship.

Edit: Wow I got more replies than I thought I would get, thank you all for the advice. I have been trying to read every single comment but there is a lot. A lot of you were asking what his body count was and it was lower than me which is also a reason why he hated my number. But I will bring this up later on after I’m done work and have another talk with him."
b9v8sv,"*UPDATE - Don't want to have a ""Click-Bait"" Title - Wife's Wedding Band(s)",9062,0.97,145,2019-04-06 00:34:43,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,,False,"[**\*\*\*Original Post\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/)

So, I have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  We kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  What we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  While ordering, Oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is ASTOUNDED, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  Youngest son says he can fix THAT and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""WTF is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  She is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, I take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits PERFECTLY on her finger, and she has quite LITERALLY had enough!  She finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until My oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and I place the next size on the table.  At this point she's just staring at all of us, and I explain what had happened, and how I was able to find the jeweler, etc.  I even showed her the Reddit post.  She didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  Lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

She (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have KILLED me if I had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

So, about the jeweler.  They responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  The oldest son IS making jewelry and doing repairs ONLY to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  Once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  They sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  I followed up asking if there was ANY way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  Regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""Texan"" Gift Package and sending it to them.

And that's it.  She is extremely happy and overjoyed.  I am really glad it's ""over"" as I had NO idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent Silver, Gold, and Platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***Edit - I keep reading comments about the Jewelers, and this being fake.  The Daughter, Son, and an Uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  From what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  So, take that however you want, I have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have ZERO reason to be dishonest.  I really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  Follow the old adage “If you can’t say something nice.....”

TL;DR - Took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred."

Siblings missed it because they thought they could waltz right in at the end because his name was one of the last ones called in a student body of 900. But the ushers wouldn't let anyone in after a certain time. They were a hour late. It was just me and a cousin. I cried and cheered when he walked. My baby brother graduated today and he's miserable. 

I am worried about him. My family is blaming the school and each other right now. Im disappointed in everyone else. They're trying to force him to hang out with them to make up for it, but of course nothing will make it up to him. What can I or they do/say to help him feel better?

EDIT : Thank you for all the advice. I guess I didn't have to worry too much. He needed time alone to think it over in his room. He's definitely stronger than me and more mature. He said he hated feeling sad, so he stopped. Also said he understood that everyone had other things to do. Hopefully his next graduation is a lot better. Maybe I'll post an update in 4 years. XD"

Modified Post

Throwaway account. Indian here.

Background

Mine was an arranged marriage. Met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. Got married 2 years back. We are both from Bihar. Both educated. Living in a metro city currently. We got along just fine.

My wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. We were having sex for just its sake. Slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. No issues there. I always suspected something was off with her. One day something happened after which she got very emotional. I consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. Started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(I didnt ask how many times). Her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. She just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. She said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). She didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

After 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . Her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. All these things stopped after fixing of marriage. She said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . I wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. Think about family honour. What would relatives think if it got out.. It happened to me , not you. I dont want it to come out. Past is past... all emotional storm.

This all happened 1.5 years back. From then I made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. Always with me. We get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

Now present problem :

We had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. But I don't want my baby to go even near that man. She is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. Okay fine. Nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. But just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. I cant let that man even near her. Not now, not ever. I dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, I would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. Just the thought of him touching my innocent child, I cant handle it. I dont know what Im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? What should I do now ?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

The unequivocal suggestion I got from here was that I should not let her go . I called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. They understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that I can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). So I have to come up with a different solution. And that was of confrontation. I sat down my MIL, and my wife and told both of them that I don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. First she tried to act aloof, but I maintained my strictness and told I don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to YOUR daughter, and I WILL NOT LET HIM DO IT TO MY DAUGHTER. Period. Get it through your head. After I made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, I won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. I again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. There was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. You could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... Nobody could fake that.

I went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. That evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my MIL had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. So I made my demands :

1. I only got leave for 1 week only, so I would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and I would return. Not a day more. She would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. I would get return tickets beforehand.
2. She would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. She would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my FIL, or I would publically make a scene, I won't care who is saying what. I would take my daughter from him and leave. Period.

She was reluctant for the 3rd point, but I was adamant. She finally agreed. Next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and I was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

For my wife part, after my MIL left, I told her that Im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. It's a coping mechanism. (Didn't tell her I posted it online, or used the words like PTSD). She got defensive again. Someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. Was worried about it too. Told her she need therapy. Now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. I don't know, maybe she was hormonal. For 2 days she was pissed. And was definitely not ready to talk about it.

Well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. I think here I did something of a fuck up. After normal checkups, I told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. I was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. I was sitting outside thinking I had fucked up the whole situation. But when I was called inside, my initial instincts were right. The doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). She referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. Situation with my wife is tense now. She has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. We are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. I guess my MIL will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. Now I'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

We are leaving this weekend, hope I don't have to face any more drama there. Will update if anything happens.

Thankyou reddit."
cpau6h,[Update] I(28F) feel an irrational jealousy towards my son (3M) when my husband (31M) gives him lots of attention/affection. Should I discuss it with my husband or will he be creeper out?

&#x200B;

So after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, I decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that I now wonder why I was ever worried. He reassured me that I wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that I just had a little problem that I needed help with. We're now looking for a good therapist for me. Already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. I can't wait to work through this so I don't have to feel the way I do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words! Reading these wonderful comments really made my day. Honestly I didn't expect this to get so much attention, I was just very excited and felt like telling someone, anyone :)  Even though I cannot reply to all these lovely messages, I truly appreciate them.

gdxjbn,My daughters (17F) had a horrible fight over Animal Crossing and one told the other to kill herself,8987,0.95,339,2020-05-05 18:47:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdxjbn/my_daughters_17f_had_a_horrible_fight_over_animal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdxjbn/my_daughters_17f_had_a_horrible_fight_over_animal/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Hello. I never thought I'd be making one of these posts here but I'm at an utter loss and need some fresh eyes on this situation.

I have two beautiful twin daughters. I had Amy and Bella (fake names) when I was only 22 and my late husband, their father, passed away when they were both still toddlers. We are in a financially comfortable position thanks to my parents and my wonderful inlaws but while there were some real tough times they're both amazing, smart and capable young women. They were inseperable when younger but around their teens started to have different friends and spent time apart which I thought was great because I wanted them to develop as individuals too.

However Bella had a much tougher time growing up than Amy. Amy has made some truly great and supportive friends who she calls on Zoom daily nowadays, but Bella met an incredibly toxic girl when she was 15. She became Bella's ""best friend"" but isolated her, constantly put Bella down and destroyed her self-confidence. Back then I had noticed Bella started looking less happy and tried to talk to her but she insisted school was OK and everything was fine. I thought she was embarrassed of her hobbies as she had been made fun of before for cosplaying but I failed to pursue it any further because I was too caught up in my job. I let Bella down and didn't notice the signs until she broke down in school last year and they sent her home early. Afterwards Bella told me everything and I immediately called her teachers to separate her from her ""best friend"".

During this time my mother was diagnosed with cancer and passed away just a month later. It was incredibly hard on everyone including my daughters as all live together and my mother helped to take care of them for years while my father and I worked, they were very close. Bella spiralled and she was diagnosed with depression, her first therapist tried to prescribe medication but they made her feel worse and she was crying every night. My father and I took shifts accompanying Bella and stayed with her till she fell asleep as she was a suicide risk and posted online about wanting to kill herself and I was so so scared. Throughout this whole time Amy was so amazing, she was hit really hard by my mother's passing but supported Bella and specifically invited friends who were into the same anime Bella liked to hang out with her so she wouldn't feel so lonely.

Unfortunately last year was also their O-Level year, a national exam all 16 year old students have to take. Amy and Bella both scored amazing marks but while Amy managed to get into their dream school, Bella fell just short of the requirement. I told Bella that she still scored way above average and with all she was going through during the exam period it was a remarkable score but this started to make Bella jealous of Amy. Bella confided in me that she thought Amy was prettier than her (which makes no sense as they're identical twins) and smarter (both are equally brilliant). Amy has a boyfriend currently which I feel Bella is also jealous about. They went from talking together all night until I had to bust in and tell them to go to sleep, to Bella only giving one-word answers whenever Amy was around. I'm ashamed to say that I largely have not paid much attention to Amy these last 10 months, and I think that's what caused the huge fight today.

As we have all been quarantining, Bella has been playing Animal Crossing nonstop. I preordered the game for her a long time before the boom in popularity and she was looking forward to it for ages. My father has been playing with her and Bella was doing very well. I was in my room attending a work call so I did not witness this firsthand but according to my father, Amy came into the living room and asked if she could try playing as well. Bella tried to give Amy her control stick but my father offered to let Amy play his character instead. He now thinks Bella was intentionally trying to avoid playing with Amy. While Amy was figuring out the controls, she apparently destroyed one of Bella's rare flowers and Bella called her a ""stupid sl\*t"".

Amy of course immediately got angry and my father yelled at Bella to apologize, but before anything else was said Amy just screamed at Bella, saying she was a burden on our family, and that Bella stole her teenage years because she constantly had to worry about her rather than enjoy life. She said she wished Bella would just kill herself so our lives could go back to normal. At this point I heard the shouting but only saw Amy storm off into her room and Bella in tears on the couch.

Now we're here. I've been crying for hours and at a loss for what to do. My father blames himself for not letting Bella give Amy her character but I think something like this was going to happen eventually if Amy is truly resentful, I just didn't think it would be so horrible and I wish I'd done something earlier. They normally share a room but my father's going to sleep on the couch today to let Bella have his room for tonight. Amy doesn't want to leave her room and won't even come out for dinner and keeps telling me to go away and I can tell she's been crying too. Bella's saying that Amy's right and she should just kill herself and I just wish I could take the pain away from her, I feel like a failure of a mother. I've texted all my friends for help but honestly my culture doesn't have a good understanding of mental health and I haven't said much about my family issues to them... one of them said that Bella was 'being a brat' and another said I should get Bella committed and I'm horrified. I have no idea who to turn to so here I am. Sorry the post is so long, I feel a bit better typing it all out. What can I do? I don't want my daughters to hate each other...

**EDIT:** I did not expect so much attention and wonderful support, thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart! There's no way I can reply to everyone but here's great news: Amy just knocked on my door, we've talked and she wants to apologize to Bella. I told her I am so sorry for ignoring her and a lot of you are right, she felt a lot of pressure to be ""no trouble"" and not add more stress onto the situation, but because of that she's been hiding a lot of her own problems. She's been struggling on her own all this time. She's a bit skeptical about going to therapy but I explained we can just try and if she doesn't jive we can always try again with another therapist or another avenue. I'm incredibly fortunate to have the money to afford therapy so I'm going to put it all to good use.

Thank you all so much. Honestly both my girls are absolutely amazing human beings and sometimes I have no idea how it happened. I struggle personally with whether I'm a good mother and I honestly cried with how many people said I was doing not just OK, but fantastic. We are all going to talk tomorrow too, I'm going to call the therapist tomorrow and check out the online options available that some have suggested. Bella doesn't respond well to therapy over the computer and prefers face-to-face so hopefully her therapist can also put her appointment forward. I'm typing this while reheating dinner now because Amy is hungry (haha).

P.S. Also I am definitely getting new friends. If only mom groups on Facebook weren't so... weird, but friends without children also tend to get frustrated whenever I have to tend to childcare duties, which is why I lost contact with a lot of school friends too when I got pregnant much younger than most in my friendgroup. Does anyone have any good ideas? If there are any good subreddits, do tell me! I just started using Reddit to share meal prep ideas so I'm not super savvy!

**FINAL EDIT:** We’ve done the necessary talks and a therapy session for Amy is scheduled this week! They’re very tense around each other still but have apologized and my father & I will be taking turns on the couch to give Bella my room so they can have a bit more privacy, you guys are right they’re both quite annoyed they’ve never had her own room before and hopefully after the pandemic we can move things around a bit so everyone has their own space. Also a few people guessed we are from Singapore haha, I thought I was as vague as possible but I guess sinkie know sinkie. Thank you guys so much, I think we can take it from here. <3"
16oz1xu,Update: My (23F) boyfriend's mother (56F) keeps putting an ingredient I'm allergic to in her dishes.,8971,0.98,524,2023-09-22 08:18:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16oz1xu/update_my_23f_boyfriends_mother_56f_keeps_putting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16oz1xu/update_my_23f_boyfriends_mother_56f_keeps_putting/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"So, hi again, and thanks for the advice! I also saw that there was already a YouTube and TikTok video on my post which was *weird*, but I digress. 

Anyways, onto the update. 

To those of you who said she just didn't like me: you were 100% correct. 

After my boyfriend woke up yesterday, we had a long talk about how bothersome his mother's refusal to take out garlic is. He agreed that we should skip the dinner until she takes it out. 

Something about it still bothered me so I ended up calling her and just bluntly asking her. She kept evading the question, saying she's just a garlic lover, that she doesn't understand what the big deal is, et cetera, et cetera. Finally, after like thirty minutes of back and forth, she finally admitted that she just doesn't like me. 

I think I'm correct in drawing the conclusion that she was trying to drive me from her family with garlic shenanigans but maybe I'm just overthinking, I dunno.

Anyways, I asked if it was because of my job (receptionist), my age, background, whatever. And she just flat out told me that she doesn't like that I have my septum and tongue done, and that I color my hair ""unnatural colors"". She thinks it's unprofessional and proves that I'm too much of a ""wild child"" to date her son. 

Which sucks, because I really like this woman but I guess she was just polite out of courtesy rather than actually liking me herself. 

After I ended the call, I went to go find my boyfriend and he basically fessed up and said that yeah, his mother was not a fan and kept basically hinting that we should break up. Mostly by mentioning stuff like ""my friend Jenny has such a cute daughter"" and that sort of thing. Which hurts like hell, but I'm glad I know. 

Anyways, my boyfriend and his sister have both agreed to just start up a group dinner once a month. I'm going to stop going to the dinners, and my boyfriend will just go without me. 

TLDR: Woman just doesn't like me.

Update: I can officially say I've gotten the ick. This man sucks.

Update 2: I'm going to break up with him tomorrow. I'm too sleepy and pissed, but I'll post an update on my profile.

Update 3: It's posted."

Ever since I was born, my mom has posted literally every aspect of my life on her Facebook account. Everything. Every baby picture, every “first” moment, every accomplishment and every failure. If we get in a fight, she’s on FB asking for advice. 

For the past couple of years I’ve tried to install an “ask me first” policy, but since I don’t have a FB account of my own, this is hard to monitor. I can only really tell when I manage to get into her phone. The last time I did this I saw some.. grade related stuff. 

I feel like I have absolutely no privacy. I can’t talk to my own mother for fear she’ll post it on social media. I’m her child, not her dog, and I’d like to be treated as a human being. However, I love her and honestly think she is an awesome mom. This is pretty much the only thing she does that annoys me. 

TLDR: My mom didn’t respect my wishes and stop posting personal things about me on Facebook, how do I get her to understand how violated I feel?"

I attended a Christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. I was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

My husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. I just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. He just looks differently at me now.

The other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. He kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. I know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

The next week we tried again and the same thing happened. He then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. It was soul crushing to hear that. He tries though. He cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

Is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? But how how can i if even i don't think i am?

Yesterday I went to our house,when I got there John was sleeping and something in me said look at his phone. He had several texts between him and some woman called “Jenifer”. He basically has been dating Jenifer for the past 4 months. I woke him up and asked him why he’d cheat and why he’d abandon me when I so needed him. I had been a good wife and took care of him fulltime even after he had his motorcycle accident. I fed him,washed him and cared for him for 2 years since he literally couldn’t stand on his own. Now that I need his help he’s pretending like I don’t exist or like I’m not his problem. He didn’t have much to say about the cheating other than “I have needs” but his answer on why he isn’t taking care of me certainly stuck out. He said “ I didn’t ask you to stay and care for me.

Sorry I'm not a native speaker

So my gf loves pokemon. Sometimes when we go out she will ask me if it's alright if she checks for some pokestops on pokemon go. When someone we know talks about pokemon my gf gets really excited and want to be friends on pokemon go right away.

She also has many pokemon plushies, all of them in our shared bedroom. At first it was cute, but my friends are starting to make fun of me for dating a child.

My gf is very mature and an amazing partner but when I brought up how her obsession with Pokemon is embarrassing for her age she felt insulted and told me her liking and playing pokemon is no different than me playing LOL and minecraft. Still my buddies are making fun of us and I'm afraid she will get hurt once she hears them. 

What to do? How to convince her she should maybe tone it down a little? My friends are visiting us and I'm sure they will make fun of her once they will see all of her plushies."

This post is very long, I’m processing it and can’t write down my thoughts well at the moment. 

That weekend I ended up going back because my prescriptions and camera are at his place due to them being unsafe at my place (my parents look through all my things). I still loved him and when I saw him that day I decided I didn’t want to give up my relationship over something that neither of us got a chance to discuss fully and respectfully. I was in complete denial that the man I thought I knew would defend something like that and I selfishly decided to live in denial and ignorance until I had the courage to bring it up and face whatever answer he would give me.

That was a few weeks ago.  2 weekends ago we were having drinks at his place and listening to music, discussing a singer and his past allegations of abuse. I stupidly brought up my abuse in the past and we talked about it. There were two incidents I mentioned which I don’t want to repeat here.

We were both drunk. When he’s drunk, he has no inhibitions on what he says and behaves badly. For some reason, he decided one of my abusers were worse than the other. I tried to tell him my experience and why, to me, one affected me more than the other. At no point did I say one was worse, and I don’t ever intend to decide which was “worse”. He took this as me justifying my abuse and called me ridiculous for thinking how I did and that I can’t see how one was worse than the other. To me both were traumatic, I wasn’t and will never compare one to the other to decide which one was worse, and me talking about my experience wasn’t me justifying it.

He got angry that I wouldn’t agree that one was worse than the other and asked me how I could “defend” one abuser over the other. I wasn’t doing this. In complete frustration, I asked him how he could defend his friend for what he did. 

He got even angrier at that. He refused to answer the question and kept trying to ridicule me for describing one of my experiences as more traumatic than the other. I kept persisting for an answer, he stood by what he said the first time and defended his friend. He said in the 90s illegal filming and getting your friends to hide in a closet without the other person’s consent to watch them was widespread and accepted and not as bad as it is now. He said he found the incident amusing and funny because he couldn’t believe it actually happened. He said when he told me the first time he thought I would “be cool about it” because I was one of his friends. I asked him what he expected my response would be when he told me – he said he thought I would also find it funny. I asked him if he really found it funny, and he said yes – he thought it was a funny amusing “anecdote”. I told him I felt sick. He laughed and said these words “you are all woke, you young people. To you everything you think is right. Only you know right from wrong, you’re always correct”. I asked him if it was his sister or daughter, how would he feel? He said it would be unacceptable. I asked him if he found it ok because the girl wasn’t his friend and he said yes. 

I couldn’t believe it. I left. The verbal abuse from him continued through text. I told him I was leaving because I couldn’t be with a man who found sexual crimes amusing and funny. He told me the reason I was leaving because I couldn’t accept that one of my abusers was worse than the other, and I had to bring up his friends to “deflect”. He kept repeating this for an hour. I asked him one last time if he really justified the abuse and if he thought because he didn’t know the girl it was ok. I asked if his friend came up to him now and showed him a tape he filmed, would he find it ok. He said these words: “I will always defend my friends, that includes u and all my other friends, for better or for worse. That is how I am.”

I was sitting outside while this happened. I went back to get my prescriptions and camera before leaving for good. I was shocked to find him still drinking and took his beer off the couch to throw it away when I left. He was furious. He grabbed the bottle from my hands and in the process it spilled on the carpet. I haven’t seen that much anger in him before. He told me to fuck off, because I disrespected his place and that he never wanted to see me again. Somehow, despite it all, I felt extremely guilty for ruining his carpet and sent him money to pay for cleaning it. 

I left with all my things. I lost all track of time, at this point it was nearly 2 am, I was a long way from home and there would be no public transport home for another 2.5 hours. My phone was on 3% and I was desperately trying to book an uber and find a safe hotel to stay at for the night before it died. I was waiting for the hourly night bus to the city outside his apartment when 4 men got out of a taxi and started cat calling me and one asked where I was going, If I wanted a ride, if I would go to a hotel with him to sleep with him. They grabbed my ID and looked at my name and place of work and started asking me about my workplace (my ID was in my hand because my transport card is attached). The bus arrived and they waved it away. That was the last bus I could catch until transport started up again. They weren’t being aggressive or touching me but I panicked and called him. My boyfriend came over and took me back to his apartment to stay until I had transport, and to charge my phone.

I had nowhere else to go so I said ok. He was still drinking, 12 beers in, and still angry. He told me to sit down or leave. I sat. He tormented me for an hour about my abuse and about how I was ridiculous for “defending” my abusers and trying to insult his friends. I just sat there and cried until he said I could go to sleep. He kept drinking, 16 beers in he finally went to sleep because he had no more to drink.

The next morning I tried to leave quietly but it woke him. He asked me why I was leaving, that it was unfair and that he wanted a chance to explain. I told him why I was leaving and he stood by his view that me bringing up his friend’s abuse was the reason the argument started and the reason the night went badly, that I was trying to attack his friends. He took no responsibility for what he did and didn’t apologise for anything. He kept insisting it was unfair.

The next week I told him I don’t want him contacting me again. He asked for a chance to explain. He sent me texts addressing both of his friend’s crimes and said they were wrong, that everyone who watched were in the wrong, and that he was in the wrong for not walking out of the closet and stopping it as soon as he knew what was happening. 

He asked me what I thought was the reason for the agreement. He said, again, that it was me who started it because I brought up his friend. But he also said he was in the wrong because he was drunk and said things he didn’t believe (his views on his friend’s actions). He wanted to share “50/50” blame. He said he’d been a bad boyfriend and did bad things that night and apologised for them. He sent me back the money for the carpet (the carpet was ok, otherwise I would have still insisted on paying). 

He said he’s willing to talk about it respectfully with me and wants us to be able to do that in the future. He said if I ever have something to discuss I should choose a time when we’re both sober and are in the mindset to discuss. I agree I brought it up at a terrible time, but I don’t think drinking is an excuse for his actions that night. 

He says he’ll change if I can change with him. He said he doesn’t want something like that night to ever happen again. I don’t know what to do or think. I feel lost and worthless at the moment. I feel like I’m still being manipulated and I don’t know if I can trust him to change.  

He's made me happier than anyone else but also more miserable than anyone else. He is currently my only source of happiness, when our relationship is good, I don't know if I'll be any happier or worse off I give that up. 

TL;DR: I brought it up while drinking, he said he thought his friend’s actions were funny and amusing and that it wasn’t considered a bad thing in the 90s. A few days later he apologised and told me his friend was in the wrong, and that he was in the wrong for staying silent. He said he gave an “unintelligent” answer because he was drunk and wants another chance. I don’t know what to believe. "

My coworkers and job are amazing and I had a great day. 

My husband had some leftovers heated up for me when I got home which was super nice of him. 

So I end up falling asleep late, and wake up and call him to see where he's at. 

He's at the casino with his buddy... Idk if I'm overreacting, or if I should just end it all now. 

We are both 29 been together almost 10 years, and have two sons together. 

About a year and a half now he has had issues with drugs and talking inappropriately with other women. 

I have begged him not to leave in the middle of the night, it makes me worry tremendously if he's cheating or overdosed somewhere. 

He just leaves, no note, nothing. Idk I don't even want to talk to him. How do I comprehend this situation? I feel like if he wants to act single, go ahead. I work my ass off, he has no job and he's the one who gets to go have fun? I'm really exhausted from it all and would appreciate any advice.

Edit:
I had no idea I would so many responses. I feel as though I should clarify a few things. Most of you are right, it's not about my birthday, it's not about him having fun without me. It was the point of disrespecting me when I ask him not to do something that is so standard in relationships.

For a good 8 years we had an amazing relationship, we were best friends, he was my home. He held the same job that whole time, provided for his family. He is all I know, I thought I would grow old with him and never wanted another. 

He has made so many mistakes, he has broken me, he is lost. But I started seeing who he used to be again and I held on despite not being really happy.

He has been getting better with his drug addiction, I told him I would not give up on him and for my kids I will make sure they have their dad for a long time. 

He does not gamble, that just happened to be what he was doing last night. 

I know I'm a fool, most days I want to run... Idk why I can't."
fxs0hs,"My [20F] Friend [20F] broke up with her boyfriend [20M] because she thought he cheated, she found it he didn’t and she won’t stop crying",8841,0.9,1063,2020-04-09 18:31:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fxs0hs/my_20f_friend_20f_broke_up_with_her_boyfriend_20m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fxs0hs/my_20f_friend_20f_broke_up_with_her_boyfriend_20m/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This is such a mess right now and none of us can see each other due to the coronavirus situation. 

I don’t want to dig into my friends whole breakup. But a month back, we had a party at our university. A lot of people apparently saw something, assumed my friends boyfriend was cheating on her. She broke up with him. There is now a video from the party and it’s extremely clear he didn’t cheat. 

The thing is she just started getting over it, and now she finds out he didn’t cheat. She broke down when she broke up with him, he cried too trying to explain his innocence. They both clearly love each other, they’ve been dating since the start of freshmen year. Literally all my friend did was cry for a week when she broke up with him, and the sad thing is we stopped seeing her boyfriend on campus as much as we used to. I feel terrible for him too, he probably feels embarrassed. I can’t imagine falsely being accused by so many people, and then having your girlfriend break up with you. 

Anyways my friend, she’s been crying non stop; all my friends feel horrible because we can’t help her over Snapchat or FaceTime. But every time we call her she’s literally crying or on the verge of crying and saying negative things. “What if he transferred out”, “this is my fault” and she’s literally been hugging a teddy bear he once gifted her. It’s honestly so sad to see. 

Her boyfriend returned back to Canada because they cleared the campus due to cornavirus. And he has deactivated his social media for a while, and since he’s in Canada, his California phone number is not working. 

Me and my friends have been trying to stop her from saying negative things, but I almost started crying too because she keeps saying things like “ he wanted to hug me, but I pushed him away “ and it’s heartbreaking. Then she keeps saying I want to hug him and proceeds to hug the teddy bear. The worst thing is we can’t even see each other. 

Any suggestions on what can be done, without meeting in person. I feel bad for her, and her boyfriend too. It’s so sad, but the virus is making things complicated.


Edit: she just posted a long video on Instagram. I don’t know if this is a good idea, because it can make the problem worse. So many people are commenting what’s wrong and what happened. It’s her crying and saying how she was wrong, her boyfriend didn’t do anything. Everybody in the comments is also getting emotional since she told many personal stories of how she was nervous and got overwhelmed easily in freshmen year, but how her boyfriend would always comfort her and wrap her in a blanket. She also said things like one time he was going out with his friends but he stayed with her the whole night. She’s calling him a pure soul. But some things won’t make sense to the people watching since they don’t know about the breakup. She keeps saying things like “he wanted to hug me, I didn’t let him, I should have, don’t make the same mistakes I did, He didn’t deserve this, don’t blame him”. Then she try’s to explain things like the teddy bear and was showing it to the camera, but then just started crying when she held it up. It’s really hard to understand because she’s crying in between comments. Some people are concerned she might cause damage to herself, but she says she needs to do this because it’s unfair for him. 

Edit 2: I don’t know if he responded to the email she sent, but she didn’t bring up getting back together as suggested in the comments. She just apologized and made it clear she was wrong. I will update if he responds, or sees the video."
1bkkoqx,My (31f) husband (32m) has been killing my houseplants with bleach,8814,0.99,1815,2024-03-22 04:49:06,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bkkoqx/my_31f_husband_32m_has_been_killing_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bkkoqx/my_31f_husband_32m_has_been_killing_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"I have many many houseplants and even some that were quite expensive and were gifts from my sister. Within the last 6 months at least a third of my plants have died. I have had houseplants my whole life due to my late mother's own love of houseplants and I know a lot about plants. The death of the plants didn't seem related to lack of light, or inconsistent watering, or lack of nutrients, or even root rot! They just died very suddenly. I tried to not let it upset me too much because plants die and it was not any of the expensive ones, until now.  My sister gave me a 5 leaf monstera Albo rooted plant for my birthday two months ago. It was beautiful.

This morning I was crying pretty hard about it as I unpotted it and took a look at the roots and I was looking HARD at this plant and roots to see if it's death was pest related and that's when I noticed a smell. I sniffed my potting mix and I smelled bleach. The only other adult person in my home with unlimited and unobserved access to my plants is my husband. 

I wasnt able to talk to him for several hours, but when I could speak to him I very calmly but very directly asked if he had done something to my plants. He denied it at first. I said I smelled bleach in the potting mix of the Albo my sister had gotten me and that the only person that could have put it there was him and he caved. He said he was putting small amounts of bleach into the fertilizer water jugs I prepare. I started crying. I asked him why, why would you do this? You know I love these plants why would you destroy them? He didn't really answer nor did he really apologize. 

The trust I had in him is absolutely gone. I think maybe counseling can help us, but he is the one that did this, but I'm the one that would have to set up the counseling. The angry part of me just wants to be done with the relationship. I know that might seem overboard, as we are married and share a child, but I feel now that I'm not safe around my husband.

Edit: I thank everyone for giving advice.
The townhome we live in is mine and my sister's, our inheritance from my mother. My husband has an office/den/gaming room that is his personal space and there are no plants there. There are also no plants in the kitchen. I'm not a plant hoarder. Like he has a room for himself, I also have a sunroom and that is where the concentration of plants live. He has no reason to go in there. It's not access to our backyard or anything.
I saw some people saying maybe he's sick of bugs, but I do not have a fungus gnat problem.
I did see one person ask why did I not smell the bleach when I was watering? And I can only say my nose wasn't all up in there maybe? I also usually use a natural systemic in my fertilizer water called sns-209 that smells heavily of rosemary, but I ran out last month and haven't replaced yet.

After our convo yesterday I needed space. I spent the night in my daughter's room on a trundle bed. I am going to text my husband today. He usually communicates easier and opens up more via text, rather than face to face. I am going to ask for a reason and I'll see what he says.

Edit 2: sorry I'm not sure if I'm supposed to update on a separate post? My husband won't be welcome in my home any more and I need to find a lawyer ASAP on Monday. I did text him and he admitted again to putting bleach in my fertilizer water. He says it wasn't every jug I ever made so that explains why it wasn't all my plants dying but randomly over the past six months. His exact words  were that I deserved to be knocked down a peg.

After the text communication I went home from work early and I entered his office. I usually respect his space absolutely. I don't even go in there to grab dirty dishes. I don't know what I was looking for but the hundreds of comments saying he was working up to something worse or already was doing something else really worried me. I went in there and I found a drawer full of my daughter's dolls and dollhouse furniture and little toys. I bought her that dollhouse for her fourth birthday last year and she has loved it. She takes such good care of her toys, but something always ends up missing and it's always my husband who notices. He lectures her about keeping track of her things and how he won't let her play with her dollhouse if she keeps losing things. He keeps going till she starts to sob. When I hear this going on I always always step in and ask him to go take a break. I assumed he was losing his cool. Ive told him this is not how to deal with this with a kid and he says he just wants her to grow up responsible. I now see it was some weird scheme? Or set up or something? He would steal the stuff and stash it away and point out it was gone to berate our daughter till she cried.

My sister and her husband and her husbands dad came over this afternoon and they've changed the locks. I've texted him to tell him he isn't coming back and that he can come on Saturday morning to grab his essential things but that my bro in law and another man would be there to watch. 

Sorry if this is unclear of things seem missing..this reddit post isn't super my priority. I will probs not be updating again. Thank you to everyone worried about my safety.

fz0tgd,My half sister hates me cause I am the product of her dad cheating and I told my dad I hate her too,8813,0.96,668,2020-04-11 14:39:40,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz0tgd/my_half_sister_hates_me_cause_i_am_the_product_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fz0tgd/my_half_sister_hates_me_cause_i_am_the_product_of/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"UPDATE:I have read every last one of your guy's post and I appreciate the help!  I will talk with her tomorrow and see what happens and make a post about it!

Backstory:So I was the baby born from an affair, my bio dad left his wife and married my mom when she was pregnant with me. My dad had a daughter at that point who was 3, and she split time every other month and spring break at our place. My (half) sister HATED the divorce and she lashed out at her dad for awhile and just recently (maybe 3 years ago forgave him and my mom). But she has always HATED me, I was the ""divorce baby"" in her eyes. I don't remember this but my cousins told me that when I was a baby she refused to do anything with me and constantly screamed when I cried. My dad tried to make her stop but she never would.

Once I was able to start walking and talking and such things got BAD, she basically tormented me and treated me like her own punching bag. I didn't understand till I was older and we fought A LOT, my dad tried to stop it where he could but she would just keep coming and I wasn't about to just get bullied and not stand up for myself.

When she hit like 11 and I was 8 she calmed down and her scream outward hate towards me turned to a low simmering hate. Whenever I tried talking with her it was always something like ""Just go away"" ""go ruin some other mom's life"" and some other stuff. I remember being like 10 and asking my mom why she hated me and she (my sister) very clearly said ""cause your the reason my mom and dad divorced."" My mom tried to tell her thats terrible and to her credit she did apologize but it was forced.

Main problem:Right now I am 16 and she's 19, I have absolutely 0 relationship with her and she still hates me over what happened with her mom and dad. My dad was saying that my sister was gonna be here for almost 2 months cause its spring break plus the month she would be here. I wasn't happy cause it was just another month and a half of tension and feeling like shit for literally existing. My dad asked me why I'm ""not excited to see my big sister"" and I kinda just lost it, I know THEY made up but she's never made up with ME. I flat out told him ""Why am I not excited to see her? I don't know, maybe cause I fucking hate her? She is the reason home life has been literal HELL for me when I'm the one who did NOTHING. I wasn't the mistress or the one who fucking cheated."" My dad told me to watch my mouth and how I talk about him and my mom, I just waved it off and went to my room.

Advice on all of this?

TL;DR:My half sister hates me cause I am the product of her dad cheating on her mom with my mom, and I recently told my dad that I hate her too and now he's sad."
bv0pmy,[update] My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,8779,0.93,143,2019-05-31 05:53:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bv0pmy/update_my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bv0pmy/update_my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

Hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure I owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. Plus I've had some time to calm down. I probably wont reply to comments because otherwise I'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

If you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... And your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. It's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

Wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while I was at work. This was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. I dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting her to say, but I genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. Because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

When I get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. Not an apology. An ultimatum that if I went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering I owned the house before marrying her...)

I asked her if she was serious. If she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. Yeah, okay. At this point I remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. I asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. I kept pushing her and she kept saying no. Finally I told her that I had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  I explain that if I find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, I'm divorcing her immediately. She immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""Only"". Fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

Anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. Her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). I tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. She wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. I mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but Jesus Christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

I feel like I don't even know my wife. The woman I thought I married had some fucking empathy.

She still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. I explained she no longer has a say in the matter. Had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, I would have listened to them and taken them seriously. But by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

I told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or I would call a divorce lawyer. I also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether I meet with this girl, but I would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

A few hours later she ""apologised"". I say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. But whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. So we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

Tbh though, I don't think I'll ever see her the same way again. So I have doubts our marriage will last."
cchtb8,UPDATE: I [22F] broke up with my [34M] boyfriend (7 months ago) because I found an engagement ring. He came to my work today and PROPOSED. Help me. Please.,8743,0.91,557,2019-07-13 04:15:43,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cchtb8/update_i_22f_broke_up_with_my_34m_boyfriend_7/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cchtb8/update_i_22f_broke_up_with_my_34m_boyfriend_7/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,,False,"First of all I’d like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. I know it was all over the place and at first I was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and I got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. Thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. I really appreciate it. 

If you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that I was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. Well, I did. He came to my place after work. And I’m crying as I type this, because the majority of you were right about him. My heart feels broken and I don’t know what to do from here. I can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and I can clarify things more now because I’m no longer defending him. This post is gonna be a very long post so, I’m warning you now you may be here long.

When he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if I needed any help then I could get it. He was not happy that she was there, I told him that’s the only way I’ll speak is if she’s there because I don’t think being alone together is appropriate.
First of all, he went on a tangent about how I should never of made that post and that I was stupid to do it, he’s asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because I changed the password to the account before I made the post he’s extremely angry he can’t take it down. He was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. Whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
For those of you who didn’t read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

First of all it started with a Tumblr where he would post the content we’d make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me Reddit accounts where he’d have me post any sexual experiences we’d had together or sexual experiences that he’d planned for me. Most of which, I weren’t comfortable with. I mentioned last time in the comments he’d use phrases like “If you love me, you’ll do it”, “You know how happy it would make me”, “You’ll enjoy it”, “vanilla is boring, you don’t want me to be bored”, and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there’s more. He’d use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he’d involve his friends, have us do CNC, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. The public posting of the experiences got him off and I wanted to make him happy.
And before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which I’m posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. Stupidly I didn’t question his intentions and I know I was naive, I just thought as I hurt him it was the least I could do. Obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. Also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

We spoke about our sex life, and I asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew I was apprehensive, and he denied it. Said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought I would enjoy all those things and I’d want to do them with him because the thought I would want a ‘healthy’ sex life (his words). Honestly, by this point when he was talking I could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. Just from that, I started to feel a bit more sane and like I could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. I was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said “you should consider yourself lucky that I’ve not put any of what I have on you on social media, I could ruin your life but I choose not to because I love you and I’m not that type of person”
Like, fucking really? Who even says that? That’s such a passive threat. So, now I’m expecting that to happen some point soon.

Then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. I told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 MONTHS of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. I told him I didn’t want to marry him, or even be with him now. He didn’t like that, and got aggressive with me. Told me I’d never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because I can’t have kids so I’m useless to most men so I should marry him because he “loves me more than life” and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he’s in charge. 
I kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? And his response was “you did for 4 years”. So, the majority of you were right, to him I was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn’t love me. And all of this actually hurts, because I genuinely loved this person, and now I’m confused about how I could’ve been so naive to not notice anything. Part of me thinks I was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that I missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I gave him the ring back and told him I don’t want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn’t working. Literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he’ll buy me whatever I want (I’ve never been financially dependent on him, I have my own place) and do whatever I want him to do to make it right. I told him there’s nothing I want from him anymore and that I want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. It wasn’t poking me in the face or anything, he was ‘hugging’ (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it’ll make me feel better and I’ll remember why I love him. At which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he’ll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. His face was a picture, he really didn’t like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

So he said he’d leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. My friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. And that was the end of that.
Now I’m expecting he’s not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, I’ve asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so I can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
My best friends dad said he’ll take me to the police station tomorrow and we’ll start a report because he’s worried that after what my friend told him that it won’t be the last I hear from him, so at least if anything else happens I’ve started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

Thank you for all your advice, seriously. I received a lot of criticism on my last post but I’m thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when I was defending him and in denial, without you I wouldn’t of had the courage to end it. I also wouldn’t have been able to see it from a different perspective because I was so far under his spell.
I’m pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and I did genuinely love him, and now because I know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish I don’t really know what to think, and I feel stupid and like an idiot that I didn’t notice it. And now I don’t know where I go from here, and I’m worrying he’s going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he’s really not happy.
I’ve already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so I’ll be starting the healing process soon. I guess I’ve gotta focus on myself now. I’ll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know I won’t be going to any events if he’s there etc, I’ve blocked him on all social media, I know he’ll be here reading this though because he doesn’t need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
I just hope I can get through this.


TLDR: Reddit helped me realise my partner was emotionally abusive, he responded violently to the break up and a police report will be filed."

I live with my younger, 16 year old brother. 

He lives with me, and not our parents, because our parents kicked him out for having drugs on him, multiple times.

Anyways, that's just a little background info, I guess, just in case you were going to ask why he lives with me. 

So anyway, the problem is with his girlfriend that pretty much comes over every day.

It has happened multiple times, where she eats my food that is in the refrigerator. I have told my brother to tell her not to do it, as I am at work when she comes over, but I guess he never does.

Yesterday, since I was tired of it, I told my brother straight up that she couldn't come over anymore. I told him that she has eaten my food way too many times, and since he is not going to tell her not to, she just can't come over anymore.

He told me that my replaceable food isn't worth more than his relationship and sexual needs.

I told him that I don't care about his needs, and that it's more so about the principal of it. You don't eat someone else's food, especially when you are a visitor. I told him again to not bring her over, ever again. And that they should hang out in a park, or something.

He replied that he knew that it wasn't just about the food, and that I was really ""just jealous of her long, silky hair"", and that I'm just mad because I look like a ""burnt ass Mr clean""

Yes, his girlfriend is white, and yes I just chopped off all of my hair. I am a bit insecure about it, so what he said really hurt me.

I didn't say anything else, because I was so close to bursting out in tears. I just walked back to my room, slammed the door, and cried into my pillow. very softly, for a little bit.

What do I do? I don't want to kick him out because hes only 16, and I don't think he will have anywhere to go. I feel like I would be a bad sister if I did that. Especially since we are black, so I feel like I should \*really\* look out for him."

I'm honestly shocked by this.

Yesterday I got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the TV and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around Christmas time.

After a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating Christmas dinner. My girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""Look at that crap dinner."" I didn't really react to her comment.

The mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""That looks like cow's placenta."" that's when I sat up and said ""Are you serious?""

I told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" Christmas dinner, I told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

Then she said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on Christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

That was when I lost my shit and just went home. I haven't talked to her since. I'm contemplating whether to stay with her anymore.

Any advice appreciated."
198rdnr,I think my (30F) naked impression of a rhino has given my girlfriend (33F) the ick. How do I come back from this?,8673,0.96,546,2024-01-17 13:25:30,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/198rdnr/i_think_my_30f_naked_impression_of_a_rhino_has/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/198rdnr/i_think_my_30f_naked_impression_of_a_rhino_has/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"I woke up to a chilly morning today and beelined to the shower, wanting to warm up as fast as possible. I turned the water on, stripped down, and put my hand out to feel if it had heated up yet. 
It had not.

In order to conserve heat, like the knowledgeable survivalist I am, I thought it wise to crouch down into a ball to minimise my surface area, and to keep reaching into the shower occasionally to see if the water was warm. 

Now, ordinarily I don't mind when my girlfriend comes into the bathroom if I'm in the shower because it's all very expected and normal. I'll be showering upright, she'll have a little tinkle, and everyone retains their dignity.

But today was not an ordinary day. While she had woken up and pursued her regular routine, I'd awoken and chosen Gollum. She walked in, sat on the loo, and then saw me: a squat, corrupted flesh-sphere, splashing in the shallow end of the shower tray.

I saw myself through her eyes and a shiver ran through me. However, I saw a way out: comedy. I remembered a tweet that I had never thought about until I found myself in this position and decided to pass it off as my own.

I asked her, ""do you ever get on all fours in the shower and pretend to be a rhino, moaning pleasurably in the first rains of the year?""

Before she had time to tell me that, no, that's unusual, I doubled down. I crawled into the shower and mooed enthusiastically like a grateful little rhinoceros.

I saw something die in her eyes. She flushed and walked out the bathroom.

We both finished getting ready, avoiding eye contact, and left for work.

How do I come back from this and rescue my image as a being with an ounce of sexuality and dignity?

Update: I showed her this post and it turned out she was so groggy first thing that she didn't even remember the grateful rhino bit. Thanks to everyone for being so kind and encouraging to build up my confidence to circle back to it. Here's to many more rains!"
9syk5p,[Shocking] My GF sisters boyfriend has a crush on her,8663,0.87,2276,2018-10-31 18:38:52,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9syk5p/shocking_my_gf_sisters_boyfriend_has_a_crush_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9syk5p/shocking_my_gf_sisters_boyfriend_has_a_crush_on/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I’m [25/M]. I started dating this girl [22/F], it’s only been 3-4 months, but ALOT has happened since then.

She has a sister [18/F] and her sister has a boyfriend [21/M]  who have been together for 6 months. When I first met her sister and her sister bf,  I thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. My gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes I think it was too much. 

Little by little I started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. In the beginning I felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but I always thought “maybe I’m trippin, that’s just how they are, it’s nothing” and left it alone. 

Then more weird shit happened. 
Like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. Nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. It was weird to me bc she tells me that they’re like a brother and sister. Brothers and sisters don’t dance that way. I ignored that situation and kept it moving.

Another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. So he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. They switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  The weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and I asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. A picture says a thousand words. While my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. She posted that pic but deleted it after I said it was weird and people kept asking her “who’s the lucky guy” .  At this moment I was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

As time went on and my gf and I got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. Every time i would Hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, I’d feel the hate in his eyes.  He’d mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her “family” (him and her sister). He would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. When my  gf would say no, he’d get angry. 

It got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. Everything was all good. I wasn’t there yet but when I arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. It was like that the rest of the night. 

When they left, I finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. We had a long talk about that situation and other things. At first she didn’t see things that way I seen them but started to put two and two together. She didn’t want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. She was not convinced But agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she’ll be a little less friendly.  

At this time it was 10am, we still hadn’t slept. Her phone made the notification noise. I looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: “Lets fuck” 

At this moment, we’re both in shock. I grabbed the phone and showed her the DM. 

It was from her sisters boyfriend. 

Her:  “maybe that’s them playing around” 
Me: “you don’t play around like that”

Her: “it could have been my sister writing that”
Me: “okay then, if that’s what you think, let’s                  call. If you’re sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. If she sounds like she’s just waking up, it wasn’t her playing games. But if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he’ll go.”
Her: “okay”

My GF calls, Her sister answers, in a groggy voice. Like she had just woken up.

GF: “hey what are you doing?”
Sister: “I was sleeping what’s up”
GF: “Where’s your BF?”
Sister: “he’s laying next to me”
GF: “look at what he just sent me”
Her sister hangs up. 

We call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

When We call back, gf sister answers. In the background, we can hear that they were arguing. A few seconds later, she hangs up and we don’t hear from her again for the rest of the day.


A few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. Idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. My gf believed him, but still had her doubts. I in the other hand, don’t believe it for various reasons. 

My gf and I spoke about it things and she said that she’ll keep her distance. Either way I let it go and decided to move on. He would continue to come around but it wasn’t the same. 


Few days went by. 

Yesterday, I call her to talk and see how her day is going. She picks up, crying. She says she’s at her sisters house. Her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn’t breathe. I tell her to call me back asap. 

Time went by and I call to see what’s going on. She picks up, i ask her what happened. She says she’s home, her sister is doing fine, she’s at the hospital with her parents. 

Me: “how come you aren’t at the hospital with her also?”
Her: “they wouldn’t let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and I was hungry so we left. 
Me: “who are you with?”
Her: “My sisters boyfriend, I told him to come instead of waiting there. “

At this moment, I am bothered and disappointed. After all that we’ve been through, You’re alone, in a house, with someone that you know I don’t feel comfortable with. That’s what I wanted to say, but did not say it bc I was on speaker. 

So we continue to talk while she starts to cook. There comes a point where her phone dies. I give her 8-10mins to call me back. (Takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). She doesn’t call, so I call her. No answer. I wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. I wait longer than 5mins this time and call. She picks up and says her phone died. 

Me: “how come you didn’t call back after it died?” (She usually does right away)
Her: “I was on the phone with my sister, she’s ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride”
Me: “oh”

Her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. My girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

She calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. We talk about the situation, and I patiently wait for them to leave so I can talk to my gf about how I felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

When they finally leave, I express myself to her and tell her how I felt. From that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- She says that  I have no right to feel the way I felt. That’s her “brother in law”.  And that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

I tell her, that I do have the right to feel bothered. It might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. I feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. Being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. 




I’d like to know what you guys think.  Am I overreacting? Or do i have a point. 

Am I the only one that thinks it’s weird?  What would you do in my shoes?

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

I wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. They, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. Last Friday night I drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. That was when I created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but I didn't know how. 

I decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided I would send that. I sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". I waited, not knowing how he'd respond. Eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. So I asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on Saturday's, and he said yeah. He asked me if I was going to go, and I said probably. He responded with ""Cool! I'll be there"".

That was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. I was elated, I got so pumped up. We hung out all Saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. We didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. He then asked if I wanted to hang out Sunday too! We hung out all Sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

Then throughout this whole week while I was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. That, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. Because it showed he wanted to talk to. Eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. So that gave us a little chuckle. So we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. Now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing I have my best friend/brother back in my life. It honestly feels like I'm a different person with him being around. Thanks for all the advice!

**TL;DR - Reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**"

Want to top this off with a big thank you to everyone who left such lovely, thoughtful comments. I honestly didn't expect so many people to see the post, I was thinking maybe an absolute maximum of 100 people and even that seemed like loads. It was lovely to hear back from so many of you, and I'm forever grateful for the fantastic advice most of you gave. Also overjoyed by my new adopted reddit children haha you're all doing amazing and I'm very proud of all of you. Also big thanks to all of the lovely people who sent me such sweet messages of support, and to those of you who reached out to me because you felt you needed someone to talk to. If anyone else feels that way and is in need of dadly advice, do feel free to give me a message and I will do my best to help out :) 

Okay you all want me to shut up and tell you what happened haha. My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. ""Friend"" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face ""Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?"" 

Well, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said ""oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird"". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. 

Sorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!"
hgct15,I(28M) found out about my gf's(28F) affair with her boss(40'sM) a week ago.

I go for a run every morning and I couldn't find my phone. I asked her to give my cell a call, but she wanted to go back to sleep and handed her phone to me. I always had some suspicions about her behavior the past few months and so I snooped.

Let's just say all her business trips and late nights were all excuses for hooking up with her boss who is also a married man btw. I don't know when it all started but from the texts, it seems like everyday and all over the office. The lockdown stopped it and the wife found out about the affair as well. So the boss had to put an end to it. This also explained why gf was incredibly sensitive during March. I often found her bawling her eyes out but the reason she gave me was one of her friend's mom passed away due to covid. 

Last few months has actually been good for us. I was happy spending so much time with her. And it all seemed well. We also had talks about marriage and children and what our future may look like. She also seemed more invested in the relationship compared to earlier this year. I had already started saving up for the house already, but due to covid I had to take a pay cut. So, I began looking for new jobs since last month. I have narrowed it down to two job offers. One in the same city with a substantial increase in pay and the other on the west coast with a gigantic increase in salary with  probably the best company out there in my field. I haven't told her about the offers yet as the negotiations are still ongoing. However, this was all last week.

Since gf has started working remotely, she has had limited contact with her boss. But their conversations started again at the beginning of this month. At first, it was all about how much they both regret about what they had done to their respective partners, about how he has to put a lot of effort into regaining his wife's trust and yada yada yada. Then the tone shifted in the second week and it was all about how they still had feelings for each other but it has to stop. She also mentioned that she was looking forward to getting married to me and how it would break my heart if I got to know about the cheating. Anyways, all that texting lead them to decide to meet up for one last time and then end it between them once and for all. I found out about all of this last friday and they are planning to meet up this weekend. Btw she told me she is going to go and help out her friend who is moving back to her hometown this weekend.

When I first read through everything, I just couldn't move from the sofa for an hour. It was as if my body weighed a ton. I started imagining them having sex and making fun of me behind my back and all kind of shit was going through my head. Last week was hell for me. Looking at her all excited about the weekend made it all worse. Anyways, I am packing up everything tomorrow while she is out. I am heading back to my parents. I have not told them anything yet. Rather, I have not said anything to anybody. I have kept it all inside me and its getting bad. That's why I am writing this because I'll go mad if I don't. I plan to take up the job on the west coast. It's going to be remote for a while anyways, so it doesn't matter much. I am not planning on leaving anything behind, no letter, no text, no anything. I'll block her as soon as I hit the road. I have spent this week fixing up all my finances and talking with my landlord. And now I'm just done. 

What I want to know is, am I doing the right thing? Should I talk it out with her? Honestly, April and May was really good for us but I don't think I'll be able to trust her anymore. It was really hard even looking at her face while talking to her the past few days. I just want it over with. It's just that she really looked forward to a life together and I feel bad that this relationship has gone south. 

TL;DR gf cheated on me. basically planning to ghost her. having second thoughts about confronting her before leaving."

1etmzao,I (28F) found out my husband (29M) has been telling his coworkers that I'm his sister. What do I do?

My husband (I'll call him Josh) and I have been together for 6 years, married for 4, and we don't have kids. We have a really healthy and communicative relationship, we're both pretty easy-going and I really love him. 

He started working at a large accounting firm about 3 years ago, and from what he tells me he loves it there. He's made a lot of friends through his job and he goes out with them for drinks and social events quite often, and I've been totally okay with that. I'm quite introverted so I've never been interested in meeting his colleagues or work friends, nor have I asked to. I've got my own circle of friends and I'm fine with us having separate friend groups. After what happened yesterday it only just occurred to me that he has never actually asked me if I'd like to meet any of them, or go to one of his work events, I guess that's important context. 

Anyway, I'll start with what happened a few months ago, that I had brushed off until now. I was at a bar with some friends for a couple of Friday after-work drinks, and a guy approached me (he was there with some friends, too). He looked slightly familiar but I hadn't met him before. He seemed friendly enough, and he asked me, ""\[My name\], right?"" I think I must have just given him a confused look, because he followed up with, ""I'm Jake, I work with Josh."" 

I realised that I recognised him from some photos on my husband's phone (I don't use social media except for a private Instagram, so I'm not sure if he posted the photos anywhere - but we've got a very trusting relationship so I look in his photos sometimes - don't hate me). This is where it gets a bit embarrassing. I'm a bit socially awkward and so I struggled to end the conversation, but he just kept talking at me, I guess he was already a couple of beers deep. But while he was talking, he said something like, ""It's great that you guys are still so close. I haven't talked to my brother in ages."" 

At the time I was like, huh? But I just assumed he was drunk and not making sense, so I ignored it. He started to get a little flirty so I turned to my friends and we left shortly after that. I didn't say anything to them about it and it didn't seem like a big deal to me. I also decided not to tell my husband that I had met his coworker Jake. Not to hide it, but because I figured the guy wouldn't even remember talking to me, and I didn't want to make it awkward for Josh at work by telling him his colleague tried to hit on me. I just thought no harm no foul. 

But, yesterday morning, I was out walking our dog, Monty (he's a cross between a few breeds and has very unique markings - this matters I promise) and was on my way to my regular cafe, which is in town. I was waiting in line to order, and the guy in front was an older man. He got his coffee and turned around, but stopped and looked at my dog and goes, ""Hello Monty!!!"" Monty was super excited to see him, apparently, and so I guessed that the guy was another colleague of Josh's, because Josh brings the dog to the office a couple of times a week. 

I thought it was sweet, to be honest, so I smiled at him and said hi. He introduced himself (I guessed correctly that he was a colleague), but then he said something like, ""aren't you a good sister, walking his dog for him!"" 

I was so confused that I didn't even know how to react at first, so I stumbled on my words and just said ""it's my dog."" I regret it but I genuinely couldn't bring myself to correct him and say that I'm Josh's wife and not his sister. It was just too awkward, and I just wanted to leave because I think was suddenly dawning on me what might have been going on. He asked me something about ""sharing a dog"" but I was able to escape the conversation by being next in line to order my coffee, and he left. 

I seriously don't know what to do, because what the fuck????? Do I even ask my husband about this? Part of me is just assuming or hoping that it's a mistake, that he doesn't talk about me much at work and they assume we are related because we both have brown hair (???). But the thought that he has been telling his coworkers that I'm his sister (and evidently they have seen what I look like, so they must have seen photos) makes my stomach churn. I don't even know how I would broach the subject with him. 

I need some help - what would you guys do in this situation? I have only told one friend what happened because it's so weird and embarrassing, and she has jumped straight to ""time to plot his downfall"" (because she's my ride-or-die, love her), but I don't want to immediately assume the worst or ruin my marriage over something that could be nothing. 

I'm sorry for the long and rambly post, but I would REALLY appreciate any and all advice!!

**Edit**: Holy fuck, thank you everyone who commented with some advice! I haven’t read all of them but I really appreciate the suggestions from you guys. A small update, Josh came home at about 2:30am last night, but he was drunk so he just went straight to sleep, which is fine by me because fuck having this conversation in that state. I’ve just woken up but he’s still sleeping. 

First thing I just want to clear up - I’ve seen a lot of people suggesting I have crippling social anxiety, or am severely introverted, which I suppose you could glean from the way I explained what happened, but I’m not! I meant that I’m slightly introverted in that I’m not the most eager to meet lots of new people at once, especially a bunch of finance bros whose weekends consist of unending sports bar beers, where I assume I would be mansplained everything until my ears bleed (prob a negative assumption, but I’m sure some of you know what I mean). I suppose you could say that I’m “confrontation averse” in that I’m quite laid back and prefer to keep a conversation easy and positive, idk. I don’t like it when things are awkward and correcting when people misrecognise me is one of those things, but I’m not terrified of confrontation. 

Also, my husband and I do share some mutual friends, I didn’t explain that well but our lives are not entirely separate. The way he acts towards me around our mutual friends is extremely affectionate and normal. It is only his “work friends” that I have never interacted with. 

I’ve also seen some people suggest that what is going on is equivalent to my husband beating me and me hopelessly wondering whether I should break up with him. Or that I’m stupid for thinking my relationship was healthy when it “clearly isn’t”. Like, damn, cut me some slack! I’m a real person and this is an entirely alien and bizarre situation for me. My first reaction wasn’t to assume the worst but I do appreciate that you all have made me certain that it is a big deal. I guess I needed confirmation that the things that happened are enough “proof” that Josh has been purposefully lying, and they weren’t just mixups. 

I’m going to talk to him today, and ask him directly why he’s telling his coworkers that I’m his sister. I followed the advice of writing my points down so that they don’t get lost if I get emotional, lol. I will do my best not to let him slither out of it and I hope he has some proof that his colleagues know I’m his wife. I know that’s not the theatrical confrontation you guys were hoping for, but it’s a Saturday, and I can’t wait! Wish me luck, thank you all!! "

Wanted to thank everyone for the advice and help. I did what people suggested and sat him down and explained why it was bothering me so much and how my ex used to gaslight me. He apologized and told me he must have been remembering things wrong.

But it didn't matter at all, because we found the answer to the mystery last night when we visited his sister, and this topic came up.

It turns out that his sister was the one who did the art class with him, and it wasn't actually at the local college but at a local crafts store. She didn't have the paintings, but was able to dig up a bunch of photos of her and Tom's stuff, including the painting that Tom remembered.

This was a weird last two weeks, but i am glad this is over with.

TL;DR; We were both wrong."
ckwumf,(UPDATE) Brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make JW parents think I'm not gay.,8561,0.97,176,2019-08-02 06:05:00,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ckwumf/update_brother_15m_made_fake_instagram_of_me_25m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ckwumf/update_brother_15m_made_fake_instagram_of_me_25m/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

Thank you all for your illuminating comments. I'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. But I'd like to specifically thank [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. You were exactly right.

Today we talked for the first time since our conversation. He took down the insta after our conversation (which I hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and I gently asked why, exactly, he did this. He's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""I'm being abused and need to leave the JW."" What he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). He still believes in God and wants to explore different sects of Judeo-Christianity. My hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the JW are...they're, like, ""those people"". So he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

His motive was pretty much what [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. He said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around Chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew EXACTLY where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. So in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. I told him I was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. He apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. I think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

I established myself as a lifeline. I told him that if it ever gets too much, I will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (And I mean it: I have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). He seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

As for my parents, I just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. If they ask (and this was suggested by Julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that I might have refound Christianity but I have no intentions to return to the Watch Tower, and that he stopped talking to me. Leaving JW for any reason is grounds for excommunication. And I put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. They might think I'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that I'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

And for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. No fifteen year old can act this well. He's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

Thank you all, again. My brother is back in my life, and I now have the means to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**TL;DR: My brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. I told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, I will be here for him to move in with. The insta is deleted. Thank you.**"

I am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

My GF and I have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. This all changed and I no longer know the person I once loved. Full disclosure: I have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. She has had the wool over everyones eyes.

In 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to Las Vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. Plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from Jan 11 – 14. What could go wrong.

Come Christmas time, said friend (60F) from Las Vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate Christmas in Canada. She has a son (37M). Over Christmas eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, we hung out at this families Air BNB house in our hometown and I got to know them very well. I consider myself to be very observant, and I noticed zero interaction between the son (37M) and my girlfriend (24F). After Christmas, the family flew back to Las Vegas and awaited our arrival for the January weekend.

Here is where I should have clued in, which I partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. About a week before Las Vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to Las Vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a ‘Girls Trip.’ My girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn’t want me going, but did her best to ensure me I wouldn’t have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me I cannot come; Accommodations have been rearranged and I’m no longer invited on the trip. Given that I had paid for this trip, I was visibly upset. I expressed that I didn’t feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something I was invited to. Ultimately, she left the decision up to me. I decided it didn’t feel right at this point to go unless I was convinced she wanted me there, which I wasn’t. Friday came and went, she flew with her mom, I stayed home.

My girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (The lie detector test determined that was a lie.) She stayed a few days extra and flew back. She met up with me the following Friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. I protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn’t right and that we should go our separate ways. Maybe one day we would get back together.

This leads us all to today. For the last month, my ex girlfriend and I have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. She has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so I thought). She and I would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. She and I both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. On valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

After struggling to move on with my life I decided today was the day I would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. By pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

I called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he’d allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. Him and I got along great and he said I’m always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. She is in Banff during her ‘busy practicum weekend’. Her step-father sat me down and began with this: “I’m assuming you’re here because you don’t know everything. If you knew everything, I don’t think you’d be here. I have been told by GF, GF mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but I have a lot of respect for you. My ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and I know how it feels. Anything you ask me, I will answer completely honestly.”

Confused, I sat down where everything had been explained to me. My girlfriend had begun an affair in Las Vegas with the son (37F) of her moms best friend. Every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to Las Vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to Banff with the whole family. Keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). I am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. I don’t even know how this happened.

I cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. I feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. Suffice to say, I am in an absolute state of shock.

I simply texted her saying “I know everything, never contact me again,” and my phone has been blowing up ever since. Her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

I’m completely lost reddit. I thought I was going to marry this girl one day. How does someone change in the blink of an eye. I learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than I did over the course of 3.5 years.

Where do I go from here? Advice very much welcome.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments everyone. I've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. Since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. Just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. Her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and I've been being blamed for it all. I haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. After denying what had taken place, I just assume at this point it will be more lies. She has every reason to lie about it. Whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. Thanks again everyone for the support and advice. The succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media.

**TL:DR** – My girlfriend of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Las Vegas only to cheat and carry on an affair with her family friends son. She has been lying to me ever since and has been flying down to Vegas and other cities to meet him and stay with him and his 2 kids."

After reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. We spent most of the night there.  I told them about what I saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when I wanted to leave. They asked me lots of questions: if I am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk I was, how drunk he was, if I had ever liked him etc. It was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

The police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. They did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. I am not sure if I can do that, he has sent me a message asking how I was that I showed my boyfriend but I haven't answered him yet. I am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

After coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. We haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. So that's it for now. I don't want to have to talk to him or face him but I will have to anyway. This is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

Edit: I just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-I didn't feel the police was victim blaming, I am sorry if I made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and I did tell them everything: there is no history between me and S, we became friends through my bf and common interests and I showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. They talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say I made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. I am in a big city in Europe, I guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. The officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me I could come directly to him if I felt threatened by S.

\-I am not makng this up, I have read comments suggesting I did and it honestly hurts. I am not crazy and I never wanted things to get this messed up. This guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-My bf and I aren't telling S we went to the police. I gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but I can't do it. I also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

I am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. And I am so grateful for the support, I wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it."

We have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. We manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. I'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. Recently I got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. I didn't previously plan to go there, but I was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and I liked the company. She's renting a house with one male flatmate and I suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. This was all just to test the ground as I wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. She told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. Given this reaction, I didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. This made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing I couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason I wanted to move was to stay with her. I told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, I would look for jobs in other cities and go where I could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. After we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200B;

The fact: When she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. I was naturally a bit jealous but I thought she was innocently having fun. I'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago I went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. The morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. The only thing I saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. At this point I was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. We stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. She showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. All other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. She was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. I don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. I'm heartbroken since I saw that picture and I feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. I would have never expected her to do this to me, and I also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. I asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. Her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. She said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. This makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. Later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200B;

I sent her away on a train this morning and told her I want to spend my vacation alone and told her I'm considering breaking up. Right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and I held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200B;

I feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also I'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. However, it's very difficult for me to break up. Our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. Those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. However, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and I don't feel I can trust her anymore afterwards. Is there a way to recover or are we done for?

I'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. When I told her I'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that I'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

&#x200B;

One additional issue: we have already paid for a travel to japan together later this year and can't get the money back. I want to go with her anyway. Am I being too soft? How should I handle it?"

I made one stupid selfish comment to my wife a week or so ago and now my life is in disarray. 

My wife is in some crisis. Her work is closed and she’s being paid, but she’s home with our kids now, including one 3 year old. She gets breaks on Monday and Friday with childcare. We went into having kids knowing she wanted to be a working mother. So this has been an adjustment… to say the least. 

Onto the OG fight. She spent a long day with our kids and the neighboring kids, and when I came upstairs from work and she asked for a break, I didn’t respond well. I made excuses and didn’t offer help and for the first time in years my wife lost her temper and cursed at me. 

Like an idiot I dug in and thought I was right. I admit we both said some unkind things. But after reddit humbled me and she made me sit down and write a list of things I did for the family that day and compared it with her… longer list, I apologized. She accepted and I figured things would go back to normal. 

They haven’t. My wife used to include me in parenting our kids. I did dance pick up most weeks and bedtime was split. I gave baths. Made dinner. All the stuff. Since our fight, my wife hasn’t asked me for any help with the kids. The first morning I woke up on what was supposed to be my morning with the kids, I figured she was just being nice or trying to prove a point but it keeps happening. She didn’t even send them down to say good night last night. Normally my wife does this silly game where she sends my son to ask me to read 5 books and then we would negotiate down to 1 or 2 and race upstairs. Last night I heard her racing him and came up to find her doing bedtime yet again. The kids haven’t even noticed. It’s like she’s replacing me. 

When we were fighting I said something really really dumb that’s living inside me and festering. My wife was being nasty and said “you wouldn’t see the kids a quarter as much as you do if I didn’t arrange it and I’m done managing you.” I defended myself, I’m not an absent parent- and said something along the lines of “I’d like to see how long you can manage without me.” 

Consider my foot officially in my mouth. 

She’s started running again. She’s cooking really healthy and often. Every night I come home to my perfectly happy stepford wife, doing it all without me and I feel empty inside. 

How do I fix this? I don’t even know where to begin… at this point I want to beg her to go back to how things were. This wasn’t what we agreed on.

Edit: Fuck guys I get it. I’m a piece of shit. I’m going to make this right. 

Edit 2: thank you to the handful of people that reached out with advice. Believe it or not, I do want to be a good father and husband. I’ve royally fucked up and I see that and fully admit it. This is going to be my only edit and then I’m going to get off my phone for a while and focus my attention on my family. My wife had dinner cooked when I got home. Everything is fine between us so there wasn’t any tension. After we cleaned up I went upstairs and ran my wife a bath, put Taylor swift on her Alexa and lit a few candles. I told her to go relax upstairs for the night. She was surprised but smiled and went on her way. I’m currently on the toilet watching my kids take a bathe. People mentioned love bombing etc. but I’m just trying anything I can to show her I do appreciate and love her and our family and I want to be a present father. I’m going to do bedtime tonight and probably all next week. I’ll tell her she does so much during the day and deserves the break because it’s the truth. I get that I come off as an asshole. I grew up in a not great situation and didn’t have the best role models growing up. I’m terrified of my children not having enough and I overcompensate by working too much. This new job came with a big pay increase but the hours are longer and I feel like I can never keep up. I’ve reached out to a few recruiters tonight. I used to love my job and was always home by 4:30. Even if it means taking the lost income, I’m thinking about going back. 

Relationships are hard. And humans aren’t perfect. For all the people telling me my kids don’t love me and I’m a waste of space, idk guys, just remember I’m an actual person. That shits rough. Anyways that’s all I have for you folks. I need to watch these kiddos and start planning out my long road of groveling and reconnecting. Thanks all! 

Update: 2/18 
It’s been a minute since I bothered with Reddit, but when I logged in it seems some people care for an update. It’s not exciting. I’ve taken a lot of time to really LOOK at the man I’ve become. My wife and I are 100% back to being a team, but I’ve realized I wasn’t stepping up the way I always wanted to. I promised my wife a partnership and even though it’s been a month or so since our fight and my wife keeps asking me to “forget it happened”, I can’t. My therapist is helping me sort through my overthinking. 

My wife started therapy b/c of the stress losing her work (temporarily) and staying home has caused. Her issues appear to stem from feeling “useless” without bringing in a paycheck and was taking on too many tasks at home to overcompensate. She doesn’t feel like she deserves breaks and when she takes them she feels awful about herself and like she’s ‘lazy’. Coming from the LEAST lazy person I know, I can tell she’s struggling. And I’ve been supporting her the best I can. I often make sure she knows I think she deserves breaks. So when I see her hyper fixating on cleaning the floorboards I intervene gently by reminding her that this doesn’t need doing right now but that I will finish it for her while she does me a favor and takes a little break. Sometimes it works and other times she tells me to “stop fussing and leave her to work” and I do. It’s been working well and I don’t mind the extra work for the peace of mind it offers me. My wife is my everything and her happiness is paramount. 

My kids are mostly clueless to all this. We don’t involve them. And I must say, I made a throwaway comment about my wife not loving child rearing and received a lot of nasty comments about not having kids we don’t want. I’m weary to dignify this with a response but will say what I meant was that we agreed before having children that my wife would not be the sole support system for them and that she would never feel obligated to quit working. My wife is fiercely independent due to her past and a big part of her comfort in our relationship comes from her ability to leave it safely if she ever needed to. That trauma is hers and I won’t touch more on it other then to say I agreed to this aspect before we married and do not mind it. She SHOULD be an independent person. I’d want the same for my kids. 

So that’s basically it. I’ve taking on the role as primary parent. I get my kids to daycare/school and home and while my wife helps half the time, it’s now my responsibility to see who is doing what and coordinate things. I can’t do it all in my head like her but i have a chart that’s been helping. She rebelled at first but gave up the reigns surprisingly easily. She needed a break. I also put my son back in full time daycare although my wife keeps springing him early, I can tell she likes the break. That’s all I have for now. Thanks guys and sorry it’s not more dramatic. I know some of y’all wanted my balls and were hopeful my wife would leave me. While I would be lost without her and the thought makes me physically ill, it’s nice to see people appreciating my wife the way she deserves and stand up for her so fiercely. Thanks all! 

One last thing: I bought her this game PalWorld on the computer. She hasn’t gamed since having kids b/c of some pre-conceived conclusion it made her a bad parent but I insisted she spend a few hours and since I’d spent money, she did. I find her playing a lot to wind down when the day is over. It seems to be helping her feel more herself too. So thanks video games! I’ll stand for a lot of assumptions on my character- and boy have there been some nasty ones- but one thing I won’t take is people saying I don’t love my wife. She’s my person and it is my duty in life to make her happy. "

I greatly appreciate the support that I received on my initial post. Some of you asked me to update and I’ve decided that I would. 

There was a lot of concern about the possibility that I might have broken ribs from the assault. Upon going to the doctor and getting x-rays, I found out that while I suffered no breaks, he did bruise my ribs. Essentially I was told to rest and it should improve within 4-6 weeks. It still hurts to do just about anything involving movement. Deep breaths feel like a knife in my side. I’m tempted to get a second opinion if it continues being this bad. My doctor didn’t ask many questions about how I obtained my injures. I told him that I had a fall and he seemed to accept that story. 

I told my family what had happened shortly after going to the doctor. They came the following day to move me out of our flat. It was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done, but I am grateful to have them to get me through everyday. My parents were just as shocked as I was to learn that my ex boyfriend was capable of something so awful. They have urged me to file a report despite my decision not to. I do not want to go through that process. It’s been a terrible ordeal that I want in the past. If I’m honest perhaps there might be some loyalty to him inside me that doesn’t want him in jail. We have taken photos of my injuries and saved texts (I’ll get to that momentarily) should I need them in the future.

We explained the situation to my former landlord who was unexpectedly sympathetic. She let us break our lease without excess penalty other than keeping the deposit. 

My ex boyfriend had been trying to get in contact with me from the day I asked him to leave. Endless phone calls and text messages that I never answered. His texts included apologies as well as promises to get help. I ended up calling him to tell him that I had moved out. To my surprise he didn’t fight me. He agreed that it was for the best though he was clearly heartbroken. We have both completely moved now and I have no intention on contacting him further. 
 
I’m trying to be strong, but in my darkest moments I miss him. I miss my life. I miss waking up to and going to bed with my best friend. I miss talking to him. I miss the love we had for 3 years. I miss the person that I used to be; confident and brave. I’m fucking scared all the time now. I’m scared that I’ll never be able to trust anyone in the same way I trusted him. I miss not being in pain. I’m angry at him for ruining everything and angry at myself for not seeing the signs. I alternate between being in utter denial to despair. This has been the worst experience of my life that sometimes feels like it’s impossible I’ll ever smile again. 

Don’t worry about me taking him back. Telling my family cemented that that will never happen. As for the rest of it, I don’t know. 

Forgive me for any grammatical errors. Thank you for any supportive comments."

&#x200B;

I wanted to give y'all another update - hopefully the last one. It's been about a year since my original post, ten months since the first update.

&#x200B;

My ex did move out. Thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. And as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a HUGE relief. I didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. I could BREATHE again. I was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

Aaaand then I got laid off. No joke. Helluva one-two punch right there.

The past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. The year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year I had to spend recovering from that blow. I had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as I found a new job I also found out my house needed HUGELY expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, I just didn't have the cash for. And figuring out how to be on my own for a while - I had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess I was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (Bingeing 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' helped a bit.)

He also kept reaching out. For a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and I came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, I distanced myself. He messaged me once to ask if I regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if I thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. I didn't respond to that one at all. Then he'd reach out with things like ""Hey, the TV I took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? Like to sell or try and fix?"" I've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. Lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which I said that I wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (He also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. I have no words.)

&#x200B;

The good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job I got is possibly the best job I've ever had. A step down in salary, but I'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and I've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that I think I can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. I had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and I was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which I'd never done before. But I did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and I absolutely love the car.

Also - I met someone new. This person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. He treats me REALLY well. He's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. In the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. He's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and I'm not broken either, thank god. Maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. This relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and I'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200B;

And one more bit of good news - I will officially be divorced on Friday! (Yes, the day after Valentine's Day XD ) There are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200B;

I wanted to provide this update in part because I know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because I wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. It can get better. It really, really can. I'm actually HAPPY. It took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - I'm definitely going to need a LOT of time to recover financially, and I'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (A+++++ for therapy) - but I'm actually truly happy. Sometimes I wonder how much of the depression I'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight I'd been carrying for so long - his AND mine - without truly being aware of it. It's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but I'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing."

But after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, I got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. I finally opened my eyes to what I had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that I would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so I decided last thursday to tell her I wanted to end this marriage.

I think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. She didn't even try to persuade me or anything. Just went like a broken record ""nothing I say will change anything"" whenever I asked her to say anything. There was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. We have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

My mother knows everything, but I for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. Maybe I'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so I agreed to give her time to tell them. When we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. Instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. They have been part of my family for almost 17 years and I care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. I felt really bad about lying to them, but I'm afraid that if I go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. But my patience is not limitless. I will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

I don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. I'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". I also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

Now there are some big loose ends to tie. We need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. The custody will be shared where I will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. I also feel like their legal address should be with me, so I won't have to pay her child support. Would be unfair after what she did. I have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. I will fight for my kids though."

I just have had such large growth financially and mentally. This girl and I dated for months, but bad a lifelong friendship & we were friends since we were both toddlers.

I've always had feelings for her and I thought she was my soul mate. We had a lot of plans and goals to complete together, but she acted to play games and left me for another dude. 

Obviously it hurt and I am still feeling some sort of betrayal over it. The thing is, she had a baby with that guy. After the whole mess I cut her off completely and she kept trying to be my friend, but I turned my back to her. 

I saw her a couple times recently due to some stuff that was going on and we had some conversations on my and her feelings. The thing is I am not the same. I started making high 6 digits a year and I think for somebody my age I am doing very good. I just recently bought a house months ago, I am able to afford the things I like, and I am loving comfortably. 

She on the other hand dumped and kicked her boyfriend out. Right after she did that, she called me to tell me she wanted to give it another go. I have issues, ever since she left me I was feeling lonely and I am still attached to her

. But I also do not believe she wants to be with me over her feelings for me, more so because I am successful now. How should I handle things with her? I don't want to be rude, but I do want to know her true intentions.

Tldr: my ex left me for somebody else and settled down. Now that things went south, she got separated and she wants to date me, but I am not so sure I can trust her again."

My first experience with crazy, and hopefully my last






I’m a 25 female, my roommate is a 34 male. 

I moved to a new town last year, only knew one person, stayed with her for a bit until I found a house to rent but I needed a roommate. She introduced me to a guy she worked with who also needed a roommate because he just got a divorce. 
I met him first, didn’t get weird vibes, seemed nice enough. About 6 months ago he made the suggestion to be friends with benefits and I made the stupid mistake of agreeing. We both did not want a relationship. Everything was fine, until he started getting weird and staying up until I got home, questioning me about where I had been and who I was around. I then ended the hooking up, told him I didn’t think it was like that, he got mad. Everything was fine for a bit. Until yesterday. 

I live in a pretty rural area where most businesses are small and family owned. Since not a lot of people are getting out I decided to go ahead and get some new tires and support a mechanic shop I go to, since I doubt they’re getting regular business at the moment. I’m there waiting when the guy comes over and tells me he wants to show me something. I’m like okay. We go over to my car and he bends down and points under at a black box. He asks me if I know what that is and tells me it’s a gps. It took me a second to understand the implications of a gps being under my car. I was like... so someone put it there? It’s clear I have no idea why it’s there and he got actually concerned and told me if I didn’t know I needed to find out. 

I feel so creeped out because I have no friends here, the friend I knew moved away. I only know some people at work, but we’re not friends and it’s been hard to meet people. There’s no other way a gps would be on my car unless my roommate put it there. Now I’m freaked out in a way I’ve never been before and I can’t move out, I’m scared to ask him about it, I have no one to stay with, no family here... what do I do?

&#x200B;

Well, it's been like 12 days. The long and the short of it: The truth came out. Wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and I am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. I need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200B;

A lot of people said some things that really struck with me. The photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. Why would he take a picture that was so compromising? Why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? How was he so cavalier? I sat her down and demanded the whole truth. We talked the night that I posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. We went moment by moment, step by step, and I demanded to know what happened. So, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200B;

They got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. They drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. They got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. Instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. Two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *Get high.* But on what you might add? Oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. Yeah, fucking lovely. My MIL had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. They all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the MoH's surprise - a stripper. So, who took the pills *and drank?* Only my future wife. Yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. It's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. My fiancee doesn't drink, so I should have connected the dots there. That's on me I guess.

&#x200B;

The reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. Stripper never fingered her. She kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. The photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. She then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that I would leave her. She said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. She was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. Then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. I couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. I thought the pills were destroyed but I guess my fiancee didn't do that - I had no reason to assume she would lie. In the years we've been together/known each other she's drank MAYBE 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. I didn't think she'd do that.

So, that brings me to the texts. I ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. She explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that I was going to find out and leave her. Her MoH, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. Her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. By this point I didn't know what to do.

I followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. She began to panic and begged me not to. She started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever I wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. She then said she had a problem and needed help, Her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. She said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. That I don't actually doubt, I think she really does love me.

&#x200B;

So what happened?

&#x200B;

She saw her doctor on Monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. We got the name of the doctor and I guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. He recommended different types of therapy. We had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. She's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. We're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200B;

This meant that I had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. Her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. He knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. My parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. My fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. The bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. They admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. She drank way too much and they didn't stop her. I thanked them for their apology but said I didn't know what to say. They just offered their apologies and said that I was a great guy.

&#x200B;

The long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. We aren't having sex. We are right now in this weird healing phase. Her team has recommended I see individual therapy which I haven't yet had the time to do. A lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, I guess. My parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200B;

Fiancee and I are in a weird place. She's overly nice and sympathetic. Since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. She submits to drug tests and we have a BACTrack if I'm concerned she's drinking. I'm a lot more aware of what's going on. She's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. She's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200B;

I kind of feel like I got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. People keep telling me to watch out for myself, but I'm not sure what to do.

&#x200B;

So that's what happened. I'm stunned and confused. Turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. I still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. For now, I'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend."
9y58ch,Final Post on: I'm a female born without a vagina.

[Updated Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

I was going to make this an edit but due to its length, I figured to make it a separate post. I don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but I sincerely apologize if I am in the wrong.

I just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things I've mentioned in the comments briefly. I hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

But before I do that, I want to thank everyone who sent me a DM, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. I’ve read through all of them, but I haven’t gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. You have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much I appreciate it. I love you all <3

# Quick update:

I texted Kyle yesterday and he replied. I asked him how he was feeling. He said he was even more sick than earlier. I said I was too, and I said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). I told him about how I had a volunteer thing at University which I went to and how I nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. But that was it. We didn’t talk about much else because he stopped responding.

In addition to this, I haven’t called the number my TA gave me because they are only open Monday - Friday from 8am to 4pm. So, I’m going to be doing that on Monday, hopefully.

# My condition:

The exact name for my condition is Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser Syndrome, or MRKH Syndrome for short. It affects 1 in every 5000 women. A lot of people, I’m assuming they were trolls, stated that I was a guy or something along those line. Just to clarify, I am a woman, I look like a woman physically and I’ve felt like a woman my whole life. I was genetically born with XX chromosomes. Being a woman is not something I doubt.

There are basically 2 types of branches within MRKH. Type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. Type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. This may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. I have type 1. There are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. I am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# Diagnosis:

A lot of people were confused as to why I was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did I find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

The way MKRH works is that it affects INTERNAL reproductive organs. This means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. From the outside, I look like a normal female. I have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. I am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. My ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why I am still physically able to look like a female. For me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, I have something called an indentation or ‘dimple’. For 18 years of my life, I lived thinking I was just like any other girl. I never once suspected anything wrong.

When I started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. But this was around the time I started to feel like something was wrong. One main reason was that I hadn’t started my period, and the second being the fact that I wasn’t able to insert a finger inside my vagina. For some reason, at the time, I assumed periods and fingering went together. I thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina “opened” and the barrier fell out or something like that. Its weird looking back at that now haha.

I went to the doctors one day (this was before I started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. This is probably one of the most common ways women with MRKH find out about it. The doctors simply assumed that I was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. I was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. I was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. The following year, I got my shit together on my own. I joined the wrestling team, track team, and I started doing weight training. As a result of this, I was also eating way more, and I gained a lot of muscle mass. I got my weight up to 120lbs. when I still hadn’t gotten my period, I went back to the doctors. They still didn’t take it too seriously, telling me that some women don’t get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. I had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. I didn’t feel like everything was normal, so I switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. Needless to say, I was getting tired of blood tests because I knew they didn’t show anything. One doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but I think that was circumstantial. Prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that I had breast discharge which is something I had NEVER experienced before in my life. Some how, I can’t exactly remember which doctor, I ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to “reset” my biological functions and induce a period. I diligently took the BC pills every day. Nothing happened. This is when I thought, “Is it just me or does healthcare in Canada suck?”.

Then another doctor suggested I get a pelvic ultrasound done. This is when they found the issue. The poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn’t even exist. The doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. She stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom I had MRKH. She said according to the ultrasound I had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). She literally didn’t even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. I walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. His response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and I could hear him. And then he said, “its okay, just forget it”. I came home, and I did some googling and started to learn more about MRKH. I had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and I texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. I also added that if it changed anything between us, that I would understand, and I wouldn’t hold it against him. As much as I might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something I really needed at the time.

After the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a SickKids Hospital in downtown Toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. They started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. They had me get an MRI done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an MRI. I also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). Doctors aren’t allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. I ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because I didn’t have one. The look on their face was hilarious as I’m sure they probably never heard of my condition either. After I met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, I was properly informed that I did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but I was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. I was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. They had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a Q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. The depth of it was about 3mm deep. It was actually quite painful, and I hated doctors by this point anyways.

# Family Situation:

My parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are HIGHLY taboo. Everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn’t know English well so most of the time when I went to the doctors, I went with my dad. It was very weird and awkward. The few times my dad refused to go with me, I went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

After my last appointment with SickKids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. My dad took those from me and threw them out, saying I didn’t need them. They also asked if I would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that I didn’t it. Going to therapy at the Hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. I can’t drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. Taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which I don’t particularly mind doing if it helps me, but I don’t have time due to school. I actually got a letter from the hospital in September about a pretty cool MRKH conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. I really really wanted to go. But again, it was far. I figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I could definitely bus there. The event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. It was unrealistic for me to go. So then I told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. They’ll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" I tried arguing that it was EXACTLY the opposite of that, and that they WANT to inform you that you ARE women despite the lack of certain organs. They responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) I had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

I had someone telling me that I need to stand up to my parents. My parents aren’t the issue, but my dad is. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that I don’t particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something I refuse to do. I am well aware of the shitty situation I am in. I know they are being abusive, in more than one way. I’ve thought long and hard about it, and I’ve come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. I’m not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we’re like a normal family. I’ve seriously taken everyone’s well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# Surgery:

I had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. In my first post, somewhere in the comments, I believe I said something along the lines of “Im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now”, as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why I can’t get surgery yet. Lucky for me, I live in Canada and I have health insurance! Surgery is definitely an option for me. But due to my family situation, they believe that I wont need surgery until after I get married because I mean its not like I’m going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# Additional comments:

1. A lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that I could look into doing anal. It’s all about personal preference, and I hate it. Its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. I can look into the asexual community, but I am NOT asexual. I may not be able to satisfy my needs, but I do have a pretty high sex drive, and I do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. I don’t know if I would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. A lot of people had a lot to say about how I handled the situation. Some saying I did the right thing, and others saying I did it too soon. Honestly, I haven’t figured out the right way to go about it. I have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. I once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""Aren't you surprised I still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" I was so taken aback by it, I didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. Someone said that “If a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, I’m sure its an important part of their life but it’s a huge first date turn off. So he shouldn’t disclose it on the first date”. True, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his IBS. I didn’t disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was RELEVANT to what was happening. I evaluated the situation I was in with Kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so I had to tell him. Agree or not, first date material or not, I’m going to stand by with what I did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. I am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. Its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest I do that, but you don’t really know what its like until you’re actually in the situation yourself. I don’t want to publicly display it to guys I’m not interested in, nor to those who aren’t interested in me. I know guys who also use those dating apps, and I don’t want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. The guy I ended up calling on Tuesday night, after I left Kyle’s apartment, he knows about my condition. He has told me that it wouldn’t bother him. I had a lot of messages telling me that I shouldn’t friend-zone him, and that I should give him a chance. Here is the real reason why I’m not attracted him nor why I would never ever give him a chance: He's basically doing nothing with his life. He's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. Whereas I on the other hand, I work part-time, I study my ass off in school, and I make time to do extra curricular stuff. I also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. But I treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. I'm not saying I'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am I saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. I'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and I'm not into that. In addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **“the other guy”**. He was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because “he was lonely”. I was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, I am. There is no way I am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. I think one of the main reasons I even turned to reddit in the first place was because I am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. Social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and I don’t want them finding out. There was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me I can’t find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications I got.

This is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. I hope I answered some questions. I really do appreciate all the support I got. Thank you, and take care everyone <3

Edit: I'm only doing this to feel better about myself: Kyle replied. ""I definitely do not want to get involved"". Fuck you, Kyle. If y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. I welcome it with open arms. 

Edit: I think I forgot to address this earlier. For those of you asking whether I can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. My clitoris is underdeveloped. Stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. Maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? I don't know. I haven't tried. 

Edit: GUYS. I. CAN. STILL. PEE. I have a urethra. You do not put a guys pee-pee in the same place you pee from. Simply anatomy. "
ff47rf,I (26M) had a heart attack and no one cared.

Didn't know whether to put this in r/offmychest or not. Figured I'd start here.

&#x200B;

Back in early December (the 7th or 8th) I had a heart attack, which lead to cardiac arrest. I was really overworked and stressed myself out. I was hardly sleeping or eating, and I was pounding tons of energy drinks. I know that was stupid. Working so much was also stupid. I’m young and relatively healthy all things considered. I was sort of alone when it happened, and a co-worker found me sometime after I had passed out.

While I was in the hospital, no one came to see me. Friends or family. That really hurt, but I was only in the hospital for 4 or 5 days. A few friends said they would come see me, but never did. One friend even offered to take me to one of my follow up appointments, but blew me off to hang out with her friends. We ended up getting into a huge argument over it and don’t talk anymore. I’ve told most of my friends and family. Excluding my parents (who are biologically required to care) no one really seems to care or be concerned. I hate saying this cause it sounds super dramatic, but I actually could have died. I’ve been dealing with memory issues ever sense, and my doctor says the longer it goes on the more likely it is to be permanent.

I feel like I’m all alone now. I’m angry and upset at everyone, and I don’t know what to do from here? Do I just need to get over it?  I’m still dealing with memory issues which are super scary and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

TL:DR: I had a heart attack that has lead to some possibly life long issues and none of my friends or family cared.

EDIT: I wanna add a little more context around the actual heart attack. Basically, I have a day job (I work IT at my local school district) I was asked/offered to come help my father's company set up a brand new office. I 100% should have said no as it was way to much work on top of my already packed schedule, but I had just broken up with a girl and needed something to focus on (and it was just a super cool opportunity I didn't wanna pass up). Between my day job and this project I had no free time, was getting like 4 hours of sleep if I was lucky, and just drinking tons of caffeine/energy drinks and not eating. 3ish weeks of this was too much for my body to handle. I'm generally not crazy overworked. I just took on a 2nd job/project that I really shouldn't have. Had I not done that, I'm positive I wouldn't be in this situation. The project was meant to last about 2 months, maybe less. "
f8trpg,"My (24f) boyfriend (31m) got trashed at a wedding where I was the MOH, embarrassed me and himself, proceeded to lie about some things too",8402,0.94,939,2020-02-24 22:02:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f8trpg/my_24f_boyfriend_31m_got_trashed_at_a_wedding/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f8trpg/my_24f_boyfriend_31m_got_trashed_at_a_wedding/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"About a year and a half ago my best friend became engaged to her now husband. I was asked to be the maid of honor and was extremely happy to do so. Over the past year I helped her with whatever needed to be done. Throughout all of this I talked to my boyfriend about it. He knew how happy I was for her, he knew that I had a big part in the wedding, he knew my parents would be attending the wedding, he knew everything that I knew about the wedding. He knew the day & time, and what would be expected of him and when he needed to show up. 


FWIW, I didn't talk his ear off about the wedding. I would only really talk about it if I had gone, for example, dress shopping or something with my friend. 


However, last week (a couple days before the wedding) he started to act kinda weird about it. He said something along the lines of ""I know you don't want to be involved in the wedding, it will be over soon. And then you can forget all about it and everything will be normal again."" I've been nothing but happy and excited for my friend and this wedding. But, he continued to act like I wasn't having fun and tried to convince me that I hated every minute of helping my friend plan her wedding. Last week he continued talking about the wedding like it was something awful and stupid. He treated it as annoying chore we had to do, he complained about having to go. He even asked me after the rehearsal dinner if he could just not go to the wedding at all - keep in mind I had already RSVP'ed for both of us, my parents were expecting him, he just dropped that on me as we were going to bed before the wedding day.  He also never expressed his congratulations towards the bride or groom at any point. 


The day of the wedding was this past Saturday. I told my boyfriend what time he needed to show up. Lately he has been notoriously late for everything, like several hours late to anything he's invited to - he's always been late, but it's been getting ridiculous. A lot of times he's late because he is hanging out with one his friends smoking weed and playing video games, and he ends up losing track of time. I didn't want him to be late to my best friend's wedding, so I basically told him he needed to be there 3 hours earlier than what was necessary (I told him he needed to be there at 1pm, when in reality he needed to be there before 4:30pm, he showed up around 4:30pm). 


He got there right as cocktail hour started and got drunk, I was told by someone else that he was pounding back the beers as soon as the bartender started to serve alcohol. Then he sat with my parents, and told my mom ""if I didn't come to this thing OP would have killed me."" Once the bride and groom were announced Mr & Mrs X, my boyfriend loudly cheered and loudly clapped as everyone else did a normal clap. It wasn't a very big wedding so it was weird and awkward when he did this. It stood out a lot and obvious that he was already inebriated. Multiple people looked over at him in a ""wtf"" way. I felt awful and embarrassed when this happened. 


After all the photos were taken he found me and told me that his work called and that he needed to go in ASAP. Before the wedding he assured me that he had taken the day off and that his work (he's a bartender) knew he would be at a wedding that day. I knew he was lying to me, but I didn't care at that point. He left (ubered) to supposedly go to work. When I finally got home around 2am he told me that it turned out that work didn't actually need him and he ""forgot"" the name of the venue so he couldn't uber back to it, and that his phone was acting weird and couldn't get a text message to be sent to me. He told me how he really wanted to come back to the reception but he just couldn't make it happen. Obviously those were all lies.


I feel like his behavior was just abhorrent. I'm so pissed off at him right now, I'm looking at him in a new negative light and I can't stop thinking about how awful he was throughout this whole wedding event. I know some people act weird about weddings sometimes, but this takes the fucking cake. Is there any coming back from this? I feel like I'm always going to be pissed off about what happened. I don't know if I can forgive him. 


I've thought about ending it with him because of this. I don't know if I'm overreacting or not. I don't think he has any intentions on apologizing. We haven't talked about the wedding that much since this past Saturday. He doesn't think he's done anything wrong. What do I do? Am I crazy to think his actions are god awful?

**EDIT:** 

**I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I was wanting to create a throwaway account so my post wouldn't be that noticeable. Oh well, my boyfriend uses reddit but I don't think he goes to the relationship subreddits at all.**

**Anyway, I've tried  most of the comments here and I've been thinking about what you all have said. It's basically confirmed that I need to end things with him. I actually tried to end things with him a couple of hours ago. He doesn't seem to be accepting the breakup. He started to apologize to me about what happened and how he'll try to be better.**

**I'm currently at a friend's house for the night. I brought some things with me that should last a couple of days.**

**But I'm really not sure what else to do. Both of our names are on the lease, and he's still at the apartment for all I know.**

**Thank you for all the help. Reading through the comments basically told me everything I already knew and confirmed for me that I need to dump his ass. I'll try to post an update in a couple of days.**

**As of now he doesn't seem to want to leave the apartment, so we'll see what happens.**"

She was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. I thought things had hit rock bottom. She essentially died in front of me, and I was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

All things considered, I was coping as well as could be expected. Make no mistake, I was going through the expected grieving reactions. I raged and hysterically cried for days. I went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. But I have good friends and I have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

In the process of going through her belongings I discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. It looks like she started cheating during a period where I was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. After mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, I was back at a new job. However, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that I was distant to her. In the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father’s death. 

What more can life do to me? This man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. He appears to be the exact opposite of me. I am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. The logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but I could never have imagined this. 

I am absolutely and totally devastated. The only saving grace is that we never had children. I wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. I suppose now I know the truth of why. 

I feel like I will never be happy again. "
1dttz37,UPDATE: Future MIL (54F) called me (23F) stupid and now I’m considering calling off the wedding. How do I approach the situation?,8366,0.98,793,2024-07-03 00:39:38,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dttz37/update_future_mil_54f_called_me_23f_stupid_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dttz37/update_future_mil_54f_called_me_23f_stupid_and/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"First of all, I wanted to say thank you to people who reached out to answer my questions about black holes, snails, ducks, light bulbs and other stuff. I would love to have you as my friends. 

For the other people who said I should just shut up - I don’t really care if you find me annoying or hard to be around. I’m okay with that. I don’t exist to please everyone. I’m just here for a good time, have my own interests and learn. 

I didn’t expect my post to gain so much attention but I’m so grateful for the advice. Most of you told me to break up with him and at the very least confront him, so that’s what I decided to do. You gave me a push and confidence to do it. 

But before I did that, I texted the wife of John’s brother, the one who said she liked me asking questions. I asked if we can meet up for coffee. She said sure.

We met and I didn’t see the point in pretending to her that I didn’t hear their conversation. So after some small talk I just said „I heard you all talking about me during the bbq”. She immediately got sad and said she feels embarrassed. She explained that it wasn’t a joke, wasn’t out of context, that it was just mean and hurtful. She said she’s sorry for not defending me more, but I said that’s it’s okay and I understand. I told her that I don’t blame her for anything, and just wanted to make sure that I understand the situation and see it for what it really was.. And it really was laughing about me behind my back. Just bullying. 

At this point I just had to confront John. In my last post so many comments were saying that he will probably try gaslighting me. And you were right. 

We were having dinner together for the first time since the bbq happened, because before I tried my best to avoid him. (Yes, I know, not very mature of me, but other than you guys I don’t really have a strong support system. My family and best friends are hundreds of kilometers away. I only have two good friends here) I was so stressed I thought I’m going to pass out. My legs were shaking and I was terrified because I knew deep down that this is the moment when my five year relationship goes down the drain. 

I looked him in the eyes and asked „How does the sun work?”. He looked confused, so I followed with „Where should I put my fork? Why does nobody like me?” At this point realization hit him and he started nervously laughing. I said I was there and I heard them. After the initial shock passed, he got mad. He said its rude to eavesdrop. I said it’s rude to bully people. 

He tried telling me that it was just a joke. That I shouldn’t be so uptight. That it really was funny. 
I said that I didn’t find it funny and went to the guest  to calm down. He started panicking. He was asking me to please talk to him. He was much more apologetic and said that he will be 100% honest with me. I asked if his mother made similar comments before the bbq. He said yes. I asked him if he ever defended me. He said he tries to. I don’t know if I believe him. He told me he loves me and respects me. I don’t know if I believe it either.

I said that I love him too, but I need a break. He’s all I ever known. He was my first and only partner. I have no outside perspective of this, I have no experience. I need a moment to think. I will be going to my friends house for a while to think everything through. The apartment has his name on the lease anyway.

After I gathered some of my things and left, he kept texting me non stop. He tried calling but I didn’t respond. I was very hurt because he tried to belittle my feelings and only later when he realised that I might break up with him, started apologising. 

The next day I decided to give him another chance to explain himself and I came back to the apartment. He seemed very sad and tired. He said that he told his mother that I overheard them. I said I don’t care. It’s his time to step up and show me that he cares, I’m not interested in a apology from his mother. I’m already done with her. I can’t put up with this behaviour and mocking me like we’re in primary school. 

I saw a comment saying that probably her ego is hurting. I think it’s true. She never got the chance or never had desire to have an education. She is a very good home maker but outside of that she doesn’t have many interests of her own. If I’m asking her about making tomato soup she will be talking for 30 minutes lecturing me about adding enough sugar, but not too much. She will lecture anyone who is willing to listen. But anytime someone is talking about something she’s not familiar with - she gets defensive and try to imply that nobody cares about that and if its not relevant to her, it shouldn’t be discussed. 

Once again he tried telling me that I should relax because it was only a joke and at this point I had enough. I took of my ring and told him that his behaviour is a joke and I can’t be the punch line. I told him that I wish him and his family the best and to look in the mirror to check if they really are as superior as they think they are. I said I’m going to be back with my friend soon to pick up the rest of my stuff and to not contact me again unless it’s about moving my things out. 

And that’s it. I’m done. Thank you all for the advice. Without you I wouldn’t have the confidence to leave this man. I know I deserve better. I can’t be with someone who can’t stand up for me, and I wouldn’t be able to feel comfortable around his family, so I’m done with the relationship. I hope they will treat his next girlfriend better. Thank you again reddit for advice!"

I would watch him during the day and work at night. My sister lived with us and she would watch him at night. 

I would go to a cafe before I started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. My friend was there typing on a laptop. We started talking and I found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

I told him I never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my GED. The next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. He helped me study and I passed. 

He helped me get a job as a receptionist.  I can afford better care for my child. 

We are still friends and I have fallen in love with him. I'm not sure if he could ever like me in that way. 

Is it worth asking him if he does or Not? Or do you think that would ruin our friendship?

I'm not sure he would want to be with me because of my past. 

Edit: he knows about my past and he knows and gets along with my child."

Admittedly now that I think back on it, it wasn't the most well thought out or planned proposal. It was mostly spontaneous and came as we were lying in bed together, so I didn't even have a ring at the time.

At the time, my girlfriend said that she would love to marry me, but she had been looking forward to a more elaborate proposal. I assured her that I'd sort something out.

A month later after shopping for the perfect ring, I set up some candles when she was coming home one day (think the Chandler/Monica proposal in Friends) and asked her again.

Well, my GF loved the ring (thankfully) and teared up with happiness. She said that she really appreciated my effort, but what she meant by 'elaborate' was something original that she could tell our kids about one day. She mentioned the name of one of her friends whose boyfriend (we both know) proposed by making a huge video montage of their time together and putting it on a projector.

I decided to start over and in February I planned a 3-night trip away in our favourite city. This time I spared no expense and ordered all the extras: a 5-star hotel, a photographer, even an opera quartet. When I asked her to marry me, my GF said 'yes' and I thought all was well. Except when we were alone again she gently told me that she didn't think now was the 'right time' and she was so worried about her future/COVID-19 that a proposal now wouldn't be a good memory for her.

Since then I've carried the ring around with me almost everywhere. At this point I've even tried to involve my GF in some of the proposal planning, asking where/when/how she'd like us to get engaged and what would make her happy.  However, all she has told me is that she doesn't know exactly what she's looking for and 'I'll know when the right proposal comes'. From my perspective, this is hugely frustrating since in all other respects she's assured me she wants us to begin our lives together.

Last week I thought I'd bite the bullet again, and after cooking her a homemade meal I asked her if she'd like to be my wife. She asked me if I was 'trying to propose' and I asked her what was wrong with that. Once more, she told me that she can't wait to marry me but it still wasn't *quite* the proposal she needed.

Honestly, at this point I'm frustrated. I realise that my girlfriend might come off as pushy or high-maintenance in this post, but I love her very much and in day-to-day life she's honestly the most understanding, chill person to be around.

However, I don't understand why she's acting this way and what I'm supposed to do to satisfy her with the 'perfect proposal' at this point. I'm confused and running out of patience. How do I deal with this?

**TL;DR**: I have proposed to my GF 4 times and she has told me that while she wants to marry me, she's looking for a different proposal. Advice?"

&#x200B;

I said I'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200B;

EX-BF kept trying to get in touch through common friends. They kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if I was really sure it happened. They offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so I'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. But I've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. To the ones who insisted I told them I wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, I'd block them too.

I ran into EX BF at this book thing I go to often (hobby of mine). Maybe I'm being presumptuous, but I think he went there for me. He didn't really have any business there, but I'm just speculating really. He asked if I had a few minutes for coffee, I said I was late (lie). He walked me to my car. He looked so good, smelled great. He was so sweet. Was even wearing his hair the way I like it. I fell horrible cause even after everything, I still like him. He apologized some more, said he knew I needed time and space but asked if I'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. Said he would never talk to Jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. And I just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. Which I don't. So I told him I wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. I wish I said something snappier or wittier. But I had nothing.

This was saturday, I haven't heard from him or friends since. I think that was that. 

&#x200B;

Jessie also kept trying to talk to me. Like I told some of you on comments, I had a trip coming up, it would have been me, Jessie, EX BF, and a few friends. Since Jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. She must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause I had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). She went CRAZY. Even showed up at my place (I wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). I didn't block her at first cause I admit I was having some fun watching her despair.

I talked to my mom and she was amazing. Told me I should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. So I did. And for one last bit of print screen drama: I printed all the emails I got confirming cancellations and sent those to Jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200B;

My roommate has been amazing. We were never really close and now I don't even know why. She cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200B;

A few of you suggested I see a therapist and I did, yesterday. I really liked it. It was just one appointment and I mostly just talked, but it felt good. She gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with Jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. Made me realize she was never really my friend. She was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. Therapist also told me about this saying (I think that's what it is) called ""The Narcissist's Prayer"", which goes something like ""That didn't happen. If it did, it wasn't my fault. If it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how Jessie is handling this whole thing now.

So good riddance indeed

&#x200B;

And a final piece of gossip. ""Pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. Again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said Jessie was super sure that since I broke things off, she and Dean would hook up right away. But apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. Pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. And yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, Jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (Great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

I guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. The thing is, I don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. I want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. I thin I deserve that.

&#x200B;

I am also thinking about taking the money I got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. Haven't decided though.

&#x200B;

Anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that I will have anything new to add

Now, I think I just need time to heal and let go, you know?

I might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but I wanted to post this update now cause I wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. And, of course, thank you all again!! You are the best!!

&#x200B;

eaj81h,My [29] husband [32] is angry at me after we had an agreed-upon abortion,8289,0.93,558,2019-12-14 18:04:26,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eaj81h/my_29_husband_32_is_angry_at_me_after_we_had_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eaj81h/my_29_husband_32_is_angry_at_me_after_we_had_an/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"My husband and I want to have children and we had always planned to start around our 30s. We got pregnant and were over the moon and excited for our baby to come. 

At our 20 week scan, the doctors found a lot of issues. There were problems with his heart, his brain and skull, and he had no kidneys. It was heartbreaking to hear this news because we thought everything had been fine. After a few more consultations with doctors about what to expect, we realized the kidneys were a major issue and while the heart and brain could potentially be fixed with operations after he was born, he would never be able to survive without kidneys and there was no option there. The combination of the three meant, once born, he would probably die within minutes if he was born alive at all. 

We made a very very very difficult decision to end the pregnancy. It was horrible and we were both completely devastated. Afterward we went right into counseling and have been in counseling for about six months. We’ve worked through a lot, but lately my husband is becoming extremely resentful toward me and saying that I pushed him to choose to end the pregnancy. One, this is not true. But two, even if we hadn’t ended the pregnancy we would still not have a baby right now. It kills me to say that but it is true. That baby had no chance at survival. 

Even though we are in counseling, this is just putting a huge wedge between us and he is starting to get more and more angry and abusive toward me. This is a side I’ve never seen before but I know almost 100% it’s his way of getting over all of it. I don’t want to talk to the therapist about this because they would potentially get police involved and I really don’t want that.  I love my husband and I wanted this baby too. Were both just heartbroken and I’m trying whatever I can to make him feel better. 

Help please. What can I do to make him see this is sadly how things would have turned out anyway? How can I get him to recognize his anger in a healthy way?

Edit: thank you for the comments and advice. I am planning to call my therapist on Monday and make a solo appointment to talk through this and make a plan, and tonight I decided to stay at my sisters."
dh8zaf,UPDATE My (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but I feel uncomfortable,8268,0.94,360,2019-10-13 16:10:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh8zaf/update_my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh8zaf/update_my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,,False,"EDIT obligatory link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgd49d/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a_massive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I added this to the original post yesterday but I felt like a lot of people who saw the original probably didn't see the update, so here it is in it's own post.

So I woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. I called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that I tell her why I was so panicked. Reluctantly I showed her my post. 

We've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. I think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

First of all, what I picked up from her. I didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although I had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so I found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. I also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

What she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

What we both learned about me is that I have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. From this to the fact that I go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because I was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). That's something that I need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though I feel uncomfortable. 

So now the all important part where I tell you the decision we came to. We decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when I feel like I've worked through the root issue enough. 

TL;DR we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when I've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.

EDIT Shout out to the people acting like not doing one sexual act is going to lead to an unfulfilling sex life for my girlfriend. You guys are the real MVPs coming to bat for my girlfriend who was actually a large hand in forming this solution. She may think she knows what she's cool with but you guys definitely know better. /s"

So, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. Now, yesterday I was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. She did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


Co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. She saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming I wasn't working. What she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'I still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him I wasn't on the application and I wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


My boss calmly assured her that I was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (I get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong I guess, doubled down and was upset I hadn't communicated that to her. I didn't even know. My boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and I guess they talked in circles for a bit. He let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. She had nothing. 


When I spoke to my boss, at this point I was upset. I finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. He was not pleased. He did let me know I don't have to explain myself and that next time if I'm in that situation to go straight to him. He offered his condolences for my loss.


As for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. Anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. Though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. She has a laundry list of people to ask before me. He told me to document everything. Anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


Today, she hasn't been around me. She even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. She hasn't said a word all day. It's been a wave of relief for me.


TLDR: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. She is now not allowed to speak to me.

Update: Wow, my first gilding! I'm very touched. Again, the warm wishes and all the condolences are touching. I never thought my thread would get this much attention. I also wanted to give out my condolences and internet hugs to everyone who has shared their stories and loses as well. It truly helped me to not feel so alone. I'm sorry for anyone who had to or has to go through a miscarriage. It's a scary thing and a very weird and sudden feeling of loss and empty feeling. I hope its gotten or it will get better from here. Thank you."

\----------------------------------------

Well, buckle up, friends, because my life's fever dream is about to get weird. I will be as brief as possible, but I am still trying to figure out what to do here, which is why I am posting. Also, to preface, I am leaning towards no, but I wanted to see if I was missing anything. And - this is wild.

====== Backstory =======

A brief backstory: 3 years ago, during COVID, my ex-wife, ""Petunia,"" cheated on me. We have one young son and have been married for seven years. I tried to work things out, but her mom convinced her she cheated because she was unhappy with me.

It was a very high-conflict divorce, and at first, I made a few bad decisions (trust - letting her have access to our joint bank account). I had a ton of false police allegations against me and CPS calls, so I put everything up to a camera. I walked with a bodycam outdoors. I was utterly self-monitored to avoid allegations.

A week after I put up the cameras, I caught her and her family breaking into my house. Legally speaking, she did not get arrested because we were still married, but it does look bad in court. However, I took my lawyer's advice and the custody my state gives fathers.

Fortunately for me, she fell in love with someone in a European country and handed away most of the rights to my son. Most - as in, I got full custody, but she retained legal custody (i.e., she could pull him out of school or get his medical records, etc.). My lawyer said this protected me if we went back to court because she would probably win that before, and I would look bad.

One year later - she is getting divorced a second time and moving in with our mutual friend. The divorce happened about a month ago, and during this time, she has not attempted to visit my son. Side note here - my lawyer advised me to play it cool, don't antagonize, don't withhold our son. Also, he told me to buy a house (I am in a position to now) and set down roots to make it harder to take him away from me.

Again, our divorce was a high conflict, and I was terrified she would try and take him from me. I am more than willing to allow her to see her son, and I want to do ""The right thing"" and let my son grow up happy. Honestly - that's all I care about. Her history says she is highly volatile, and I am concerned.

======== Current Problem - Here's where I need advice ==========

**I don't want to bury the lede here, so the crux is that she wants to move in for a few weeks until her YouTube career takes off. I am not insane, so I do not have any confidence in said career. I also question her mental health (for reasons listed below). Reddit, wut do?**

Our mutual friends (a couple with three children) grew tired of Petunia and for a good reason. They assumed she would do the usual thing: get a job and get back up on her feet. They also work very hard and sometimes struggle to get by, so working 10 hours a day to come home to someone doing absolutely nothing is very discouraging. They gave her a deadline to get out, or they would involve legal matters. That deadline is in a few days. So Petunia has decided to call me and ask if she could live with me for a few weeks. Petunia joined some new-age religion. There is a lot of detail to share here, but I want to leave the tangent manageable. Instead, I will link you over to The Aetherius Society. She denies it by name, but line-by-line, that's what she believes in.

I am religious, so I am careful not to make fun of other religions. It would not be sincere of me to do so. But it started with a tarot reading, which led to going onto TikTok, and she believes that she is a Starseed and an ancient alien who came to spread light to the world. It seems like a mix of Paganism, Buddhism, and other spiritual things mashed into one. I am trying not to rant about reincarnations and talking with aliens here, so I've deleted many paragraphs of the issues I take with it. She thinks she is a chosen being, risen above the masses, and of course, that plays strongly into the ego. Everyone internally wants to feel like they are unique, and believing you are of some royal bloodline feeds into that.

Right now, I am legitimately suspecting mental illness. Our mutual friends tell me that they don't recognize her anymore and that she is being secretive and not letting them know what's happening.

I'm a single dad with 100% custody and zero support from the other parent. My dating life is also not looking up, but I have a promising career, and we get by. I am incredibly fortunate in a lot of ways. I've been getting a ton of therapy for my codependent behaviors, and I don't need this. She tells me she will be homeless if I don't take her in. She is not speaking with her immediate family because she moved to another country. If I let her in, though, it will seriously affect my mental health. What the heck do I do?  I am leaning towards calling her bluff and letting her figure it out - though it appears she will never get a job.  Would the courts hate that?  I am very uncomfortable with this position."
cdcv8h,Just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from AITA,8244,0.89,2449,2019-07-15 09:55:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdcv8h/just_found_out_my_boyfriend_was_an_incel_reposted/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cdcv8h/just_found_out_my_boyfriend_was_an_incel_reposted/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"(Deleted from AITA so reposting here.)

I met my boyfriend through a local DnD Facebook page. We started talking every day over Messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. We had a lot of stuff in common, and I thought he was really funny, and I just enjoyed his company. We started dating and we’ve been dating for nearly a year. We moved in together in May.

However, yesterday I found out from one of our DnD friends that he used to comment on r/Braincels . He brought it up in a “good for him for moving on” way but holy fuck. I only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. I managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. His last post he mentioned that he was talking to a “foid” and that she was actually showing interest. I think he meant me.

He was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but I don’t think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. He’s never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do I know he doesn’t still feel that way? Would I be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? Should I give him a chance to explain? I love him and I don’t know if I can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. But I also don’t think I can continue to be with him knowing he things I’m not deserving of the same respect as men.

Added info from last post: he’s never done anything I consider a red flag, but I also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. I feel like my trust has been breached. 

Do I end things? Give him the chance to talk? Or give him a chance?"

Hello all. 

I work for an agricultural company where my weekly hours fluctuate between 60 and 120. While also working on getting a degree 

My amazing bride is a home maker by choice. 

All of this is okay. My issue comes from on occasion I am exhausted and will start to fall asleep or will purposefully go try to take a nap. Our entire marriage (11 years) she has woke me up or flat refused to let me fall asleep. I have tried talking to her numerous times and she is unable to articulate what the issue is. 

Today I got off early after 10 straight 16 hour days. Took her on a lunch date then came home and decided to take a quick nap before working on school. With in minutes of laying down she has come into the room and has begun shaking me, turning on lights, and other obnoxious behavior. 

How can I articulate to her my need for an occasional nap and how can I get her to articulate what her apparent un meet needs are so I do not go insane. Because it is at a point where I am feeling disrespected and unappreciated. 

Edit: Thank all of you so much for the responses. I have tried to read all of them and reply. Was truly not expecting this kind of response over what I thought was a me not communicating clearly problem. 

It is clear that there is more at play here and I will be working with my therapist to develop two plans. One (much to many’s dismay) to try and work with my bride one last time to address and fix the underlying issue and two a way out for if plan one fails. 

Again thank you all for the kind words, the pointed yet truthful words, and even for some of the more extreme suggestions. 

There truly are great people left on the planet

Update. 
The Monday after making the post she picked a fight over the yard not being mowed. After telling her I was done with the way she was behaving. She refused to accept this and said she would never leave. 

Fast forward to Wednesday night I come home late again to find two vehicles with trailers loaded with everything we owned minus papers and her designer bags. When I walked in the house she and her family left. Thankfully the landlord had a couch that I could sleep on using my clothes as bedding because they took everything needed to live. Including yanking the curtains and curtain rods off the wall. 

Thursday night I came home and she was back. This time she tried picking a fight by chasing me around the house and lunging at me. When I told her I would call the sheriff if she did not leave she began twisting and hitting her forearm screaming she was gonna hurt herself and tell the sheriffs I hurt her. 

I left the house and called the sheriffs for help. They were able to provide me a way to leave as her family was on the way back. 

Since then she has sent 2000 text messages flipping between wanting to come back and me being the worst man alive. My attorney filed for a petition for divorce this past Friday. She will be served this week and I am anticipating her to go postal. 

If anything happens I’ll let all you great folks know. Thank each every one of you that commented on the original post. It was you who opened my eyes and helped me take the opportunity of her leaving to end this nightmare. "

I am planning on getting surgery to remove the loose skin and will continue to exercise and get treatment to help fade the stretch marks somewhat.

Enter college, and within 2 months I have a girlfriend who is fit and traditionally attractive. Would it be weird if I told her to wait until I had surgery (7 months from now) before having sex? In the meantime, I would be perfectly content giving her oral and being a good partner in other ways but I just don't feel physically or emotionally ready just yet.

They wanted me to go to college and get a degree. After years of therapy and hard work I have a decent job though I'm still afraid to date anyone. 

My parents died in an accident and I have full custody of her. I love her so much but she still thinks I'm her sister. It kills me when she calks me sis. I feel like I'm missing a lot. I want to tell her. But my best friend thinks that it would only complicate things and she cannot handle such sensitive info at her age. What do I do?? 

Thanks for listening to me and thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses and messages. I will be contacting a therapist like everyone asked me to and tell her after preparing her mentally. Once again I thank everyone for taking time to share their opinions. I'm not competing for the title ""Mother"" but I think it's unfair to hide this any longer."
ivxh4i,My BIL committed suicide and I’m having trouble supporting my sister because she treated him badly,8126,0.93,1101,2020-09-19 23:32:31,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivxh4i/my_bil_committed_suicide_and_im_having_trouble/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivxh4i/my_bil_committed_suicide_and_im_having_trouble/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This is a pretty unique situation here and I think I might be wrong about how I’m handling it so I’ll just lay it all out.

Two weeks ago my BIL committed suicide, and the version of what had happened before that is all from my sister.

They had a 4 month old baby, and about a month before he killed himself he asked her if he could take a day off both from the baby and from work. She called him selfish and said no.

A few weeks later he tried to sit down with her and talk about something he called serious and she said she was too busy.

A few days before he killed himself he tried to sit down with her again and he said that he was having trouble and felt neglected and like no one had any time for him. She told him that it was his issue to solve and she couldn’t manage his emotions for him on top of everything else.

They didn’t talk much for a couple days and then he killed himself.

Now I realize it’s not her fault in the sense that even having done that, if he was fully mentally stable he wouldn’t have killed himself, but if I were him I would have started working towards a divorce, at least from my sisters somewhat hysterical recounts of what happened.

She’s been blaming herself and honestly I’m having a lot of trouble supporting her and telling her it’s not her fault since at least to me it seems like while it’s not directly her fault, she basically told him she didn’t give a shit after he very clearly reached out for help. I can’t imagine my husband reacting that way if I tried to talk like that, and if he did I would definitely we’d definitely be on the verge of divorce.

I just feel like I can’t support her knowing what happened. I don’t know what to do, she’s constantly calling and texting me, and I feel like I might be putting too much blame on her. Is there some way I can ask her to talk to a therapist about it and not me? Or do I have to just suck it up?

Edit: this post has been entirely unhelpful other than a few comments, I’ll likely continue what I’ve been doing by taking care of the baby and bringing her meals, as well as directing her to a therapist. I’ll discuss the morality of the situation further with my husband.

Edit2: and to those calling me a hypocrite, I haven’t pushed her away, and I haven’t told her anything even remotely like blaming her. This post was about my own internal conflict. I have not in any way shut her down when she tried to open up."

My wife of 3 years, 10 years together, and have what I think is a solid marriage and sex life. A a long time ago she asked me if there was any of our mutual friends I was attracted to. I told her that I only had eyes for her. She said she was serious and said she want to know names. I refused to answer. She’s kept trying to get me to tell her, and eventually I broke and said a name. She then asked if I would sleep with her. I told her of course not. She then asked if I would if we weren’t married. I still said no, my wife said I was lying and she kept pushing me to answer otherwise. I again just gave up and said sure if I wasn’t in love with her I’d sleep with her friend. That was the end of the conversation.

Over the last few months the friend has came up in conversation. My wife specifically has been comparing herself to her. Like she’ll make a comment on how said friend has a better butt then her or is more well endowed than her. I’ll always tell her that she’s better looking, but she won’t believe me. I get the feeling she is very upset that I said that, and is now jealous of her friend because she caught my attention.

3 weeks ago my wife offered to get me and her friend together. I was taken aback and asked her wtf she was taking about. She then said that she knew I wanted to sleep with her, and that I thought she was better looking than her, and she would understand and wouldn’t care if we slept together once. I told her that she was speaking crazily, and that I wasn’t into her friend. She then said that it’s not going to hurt her feelings if I am, and that she really thinks that I should accept her offer.

I told her no, and she legitimately asked me if I would fuck her friend. I again said no. I asked why She wants this. She said it wasn’t some weird fetish. That she just wanted me to be satisfied. I told her that I couldn’t sleep with another woman. She had been asking me to do this for a while now and she even told me that the friend is open if I am. Which bothers me that she told her friend about this. She really wants me to do this for some odd reason and isn’t letting it go.

I’m tempted just to do it so I don’t have to hear it again, but I really don’t want to sleep with anyone other than my wife. But apparently she’s all for me banging a friend that she is jealous of. This is such a strange situation and I’m really at a loss. Can anyone tell me why she’s like this, or what I should do?"

Her wedding ring is moderately flashy but nothing amazing. Her childhood friend gifted her a pretty flash ring for her birthday. 

I thought it was awesome but she wears it instead of mine. Not on her ring finger but on her other fingers.

I asked why she does that and she claims she doesn't want to lose it or she forgets to put it back on after taking it off to do house work or work from home. 

This weekend, we were invited to an anniversary party. We were all ready and noticed she was wearing her friends ring and not her wedding ring so I asked if she was going to put it on. 

She says no, that she was okay without it and hurried out the door. I ask her why she wasn't going to wear it. She claimed it didn't match with her outfit. 

It didn't sit right with me so I asked her if she liked her friends ring better than the ring I bought her. She said NO and to drop it. 

I said no, I want to know why you decide to wear her ring and not the one I gave her on our wedding day. 

She didn't say anything but told me I sure know how to ruin a night. She was upset pretty much the whole time.

I just want to know why she decides not to wear my ring.

We had discussed the possibility of kids in the past, and after discussing this recent revelation we'd be happy to bring this child into the world.

I am working already, while my sister is in college and working part time, then my little brother is in his last year of high school.

My mom has a good job, earns a lot of money, and we works really hard. It’s been years since she has really had a break and her boss told her to take a week off since she had paid for a week long trip to a resort that isn’t very far. She went with my aunt whom she’s super close with and another friend  who we have known for years.

Obviously we are all old enough to take car of ourselves for a few days and we are all responsible. So my mom left. I would come home from work as normal, and go out with friends or just stay at home. One if the nights, I came back home pretty late, around 12 at night which usually I would already be home asleep by 9 or 10.

I heard them and saw them in my brother’s room having sex. I am completely sure that it was both of them. I was about to freak out on them but then again it’a the two of them against me and I don’t know if my mom would believe them and think I’m crazy or believe me so I just took it calm and tried to go to sleep. 

It’s been a few days since my mom got back, I haven’t said anything, and I feel kind of icky when I talk with or see my siblings. I want to tell my mom but I don’t know how to do it without her freaking out on me or her thinking I’m lying? Should I just ignore the whole situation instead?

Fourth, I haven’t told my mom or any of my siblings yet I’m super nervous about this.

So this is a weird one probably, I've always been a quite chubby child, but around a year and a half ago I've decided to do something about that and started working out and doing other sports, I'm playing Volleyball and I'm in my high schools cheerleading team. 

Around like 8 months ago my mom has started acting like I'm some sort of ""threat"" to her relationship with my stepdad [41M].

Yes, I've catched my stepdad staring at me few times and I think that's kinda gross but I had hoped she would talk to him about that, but instead she is mad at me.


At first she started teasing me with the fact that I'm lesbian, something she never really had an issue with before, said that I'm still the ""chubby"" girl and other mean things. 

Over time it has only gotten worse to the point where there are some serious restrictions on what I'm allowed to wear. For example, we've a pool, she absolutely doesn't want me to go swimming in it, because she doesn't want me to walk around in a swimsuit or a bikini. 

I'm not allowed to wear my gym clothes or any form of leggings, skirts or dresses or even my cheerleading outfit. 

At multiple occasions she has tried to hide or throw away clothes or make-up. Including Lululemons I've paid for with my own money. 

She always asks me when I'm getting a haircut again and tries to pressure me into my old short hairstyle by saying how unattractive my longer hair looks. (Fun fact: We are both blonde and have similar hair lengths)


What is actually going on? How can I fix this?"
bgfnie,(Final update) My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tried to gaslight me into getting plastic surgery.,8082,0.92,333,2019-04-23 17:43:58,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bgfnie/final_update_my_21f_boyfriend_22m_tried_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bgfnie/final_update_my_21f_boyfriend_22m_tried_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"This is going to be the last post I make about this situation. I want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses so I felt as though I needed to say at least something on the matter. 

A lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and I appreciate that more than I can say. To those of you calling me an idiot or saying I was making excuses for him - I wasn't. Evidently I knew his actions were wrong, otherwise I wouldn't have made the post to begin with. I clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. He's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when I've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. Of course I knew that his actions in my post were wrong, I was trying to stress that he is not normally like this & that he was not aggressive with me. This is a man that I felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. He protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when I was alone and distraught on some random beach! Of course he had my complete trust.

Anyway.

Following my last post, I basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. In doing so, one of them (lets call her Daisy) brought me to the realisation that I was never THAT insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. It sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. I rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me SO pissed. Then there was the icing on the cake - TWO of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to Lucy's party (no shit) but Lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? She's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. Great! I guess I'm fucking blind.

That really was the final straw for me. So last night when I saw him, I asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or Lucy's. Again, he said mine. I told him that I'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. He seemed bothered that I had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point I lost my temper. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. It wasn't even a good lie. 

We had a pretty rough argument and I brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. I cried a lot. He kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

But yeah. I'll spare the gory details. I did try to break up with him but I don't think it sunk in. As far as I'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. I'm sure he will soon. I've blocked him on everything and I'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as I would like. I'm done with this though. He dominated so much of my life and I'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. Apparently he was weird about Lucy even when he was with his ex, so I think I might talk to her about the situation. 

I wanna keep moving forward. I need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. When we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and I thought that was strange. At the time I thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. I had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. I already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly I've overcome worse.

I'll be fine.

Thank you for your support. All the messages were very overwhelming but I read every single one of them and they did help. I hope you're all having a wonderful day."
1ekma0u,My (18M) (step)mother (39F) wrote a letter to my 18-year old self when she married my father (43M). How do I even begin to thank her?,8060,1.0,587,2024-08-05 17:45:55,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ekma0u/my_18m_stepmother_39f_wrote_a_letter_to_my_18year/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ekma0u/my_18m_stepmother_39f_wrote_a_letter_to_my_18year/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"My mother is not my biological mother but I will be referring to her as my mother in this post because that’s what she is to me. My biological mother passed away giving birth to me and I was raised solely by my father for the first three years of my life until he met my mother. I won’t be talking much about my father in this post. My father is amazing in every way but this about my mom. They got married months after my sixth birthday and they have had four more kids. My mother always treated me like her own and never let me feel like an outsider or like a “half”-sibling. I was always her son and big brother to all my siblings.

Yesterday, I had my 18th birthday and I spent the afternoon with my family and went to a party with my friends in the evening. When I got back home, everyone was already asleep and there was an envelope on my pillow. I opened it and it was a letter that my mother had written addressed to my 18-year old self the day before she married my father. 12 years ago, she wrote that letter telling me that she would never dishonor my biological mother’s memory but would try her best to be a mother figure to me. She promised to kiss my forehead every morning before I got on the school bus, she promised to always encourage my interests and would try her hardest to come to every practice and game of mine, she promised to never differentiate between me and any potential future siblings in any way and many more beautiful promises. She ended it by saying “You’re an 18-year old now - an adult and are hopefully heading to college soon and you no longer have any formal reason to maintain a relationship with me but I truly hope that in these last 12 years, I was able to be a loving mother and fulfill all my promises to you and I can only hope that you will continue to give me the privilege of being your mom because you will always be my son. I love you.” and had a picture my father took of her and my three year old self at a zoo.

Like my father, I’m a stoic but in tune with my emotions kind of person. This letter had me crying and I have not been able to stop reading it again and again and it’s currently 4am as I type this. My mother fulfilled every promise she made 12 years ago and I genuinely can’t imagine life without her. She opened her arms and heart to a boy who she had zero biological responsibility toward and has been the most loving and supportive mother I could possibly ask for. How do I even begin to thank her for everything she did for me? What’s something big or small I could do to show how grateful I am for her?

Update: 

Holy shit, I didn’t expect this to blow up. Thank you for all the kind words about my mom. When I woke up, I read some of the comments and went straight to my mom and told her everything I wrote in the post and I honestly couldn’t keep it together and cried a little bit. I told her that no matter what, she was my mom and I loved her. I told her how much I appreciated her for all her love and support and that I was proud to be her son. She also cried a lot and she just told me that she loved me and she’s very happy to have me around for a couple of extra months (I should be starting college in a few weeks but I’m committed to a college for football and will be enrolling in January instead and just taking community college classes and training right now). I’m planning to take her to the zoo and recreate the zoo photo and I want to give her some kind of jewelry. I haven’t figured out the jewelry part exactly but I will eventually. For now, I just want to cherish these last couple of months before college and help my mom around the house however I can. Also letters to our future selves is something I can get behind. Like a letter I write now and give to my mom before I get married or something would be nice.

By the way, yes, she already legally adopted me on my tenth birthday and I’ve been calling her mom/mama for as long as I can remember for those who were asking.

Also, a big fuck you to the people who privately messaged saying she didn’t fulfill her promises since there’s no way she could have went to every single practice and game. I’m pretty sure she didn’t know she was going to have four more kids and that I would end up playing three sports since middle school back then. Some people just can’t be happy or let others be happy lmao.

After reading the comments in the original thread, it really made me wonder if she was intentionally trying to look like my sister for the sake of her fetish. It never crossed my mind after she admitted her fetish to me until I read the comments. The thought of that made me even more uncomfortable than before, so I decided to question her intentions.

I sat her down again and asked her if copying my sister's look was part of her fetish. She said she was really embarrassed but admitted to me that it was. I told her thank you for being honest with me, but that I am really weirded out by it. She said she understands why it weirds me out and apologized for not telling me sooner.

After she apologized, I told her that I'm okay with her fetish and that I'm willing to try roleplaying with her, however there will be conditions for it. My conditions are that she changes her makeup style and dyes her hair a different color, or goes back to her natural color, so that I don't feel like I'm having sex with my actual sister. She agreed without any hesitation and said that it was fair for the both of us, thankfully.

Since that conversation, she has dyed her hair back and has started learning different makeup styles independently from my sister. We haven't tried the roleplaying thing out yet, but I feel comfortable with the idea of it now, So I don't think it will be a problem."

I'm(F) 19 this year, my partner(M) is 21. We've been together for about 6 months.
I've got minor-medium facial scarring on the left side of my face, and I have a prosthetic eye. Short story short wear bike helmets and don't be a fucking idiot when you're with your friends.

Alright, my boyfriend has been with me for 6 months now, and for the most part, we get along well. Now I'm gonna admit, my temper needs work because I can be snappy sometimes but I've made clear from the start that I don't want to talk about my scars nor have them be touched etc. It makes me uncomfortable and generally ruins any good mood in the situation. 

My issue is he keeps doing things like touching them with his fingers and calling me beautiful as if I want reassurance about the most fucking horrible thing about me. I try to be nice about it, but I just can't make it clear enough how much I hate it. He also makes comments about how I should get some stupid weird looking prosthetic with patterns and stuff and he doesn't get that I just want to look normal, I just want to be allowed to forget about that stuff as much as possible. 

I guess the problem is he doesn't get just how serious it is to me and that making light hearted jokes about it just makes me feel like I'm different and I hate it. I already have stupid questions from people who don't know me well that make me feel insecure, but he knows me and has been told.

I snapped about it last night and he went off saying that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and I should be grateful he's trying. Was I being unfair? I feel like it's okay for me to ask him to leave that part of me and my life alone so I can move on as best as possible but apparently not."

Glad to be posting something that isn't cheating or something fucked up.

My GF and I really love this particular band, I always keep an eye out for cool/rare merch to get a little 'anytime' gift for each-other.

Cue last week. Her birthday is coming up and I found a rare version of a Vinyl on eBay for waaaay under market price. I instantly bid on it and day later someone bids back, I end up in a little bidding war with this randomer and eventually win. The next day my GF and I are chatting and she begins to tell me that she had found this really cool rare bit of merch but got out bid and she really wanted it for our collection. That's when it hits me, I was bidding against her.

Now, normally I would've just told her it was me and we would've got a good giggle out of it, but considering I was buying it as a surprise (birthday) I kept quiet. However now I'm starting to think I should just tell her as she's pretty bummed out about it (May seem silly to some but its a really important thing to us)

Reddit, should I just own up and tell her or wait a week and a half for the big reveal then?

Thanks!"

My last boyfriend went to school but never finished and ended up working in the mall. The guy I met at the grocery store was an up and coming rapper, but we’re both 29 and I think it’s time for him to be more realistic. Yesterday I went on a date with this guy my friend set me up with and he works at Walmart. I asked him what his goals were and he said he’s living in the moment. I asked him if he wanted to work at Walmart forever and he got offended and told me if I’m a gold digger then I came to the wrong place. My friend heard of this and said I’m too picky. I don’t want someone swimming in money, I just want you to not live paycheck to paycheck. It feels like women are more successful than men these days and we seem to work harder. Am I honestly being too picky or what? Would you guys be ok with dating a person that was ok with living the struggle life when they didn’t have to?"
1evojdr,Update - I (28F) found out my husband (29M) has been telling his coworkers that I'm his sister.

Hi everyone, I just wanted to say thank you for overwhelming amount of support and advice, I'm blown away and it really means a lot and has kept me grounded. I'm sorry for the slow update, I know a lot of you were interested in what happened - I actually tried to update on Saturday but it turns out this subreddit doesn't allow me to post an update until 48 hours after my first post. I'm also only allowed to post one single update so I'll try to fit as much as I can here, sorry for how long it might end up getting. 

I'll just get right into it. On Saturday morning I woke up earlier than my husband, he was very hungover so he was like sleeping a rock. But you guys will be proud of me, because I followed some advice and decided to look through his phone properly while he was sleeping. I have been on his phone so often just pissing around on it that I had never thought to check anything very deeply (I know his passcode by heart). 

I checked all the expected things like instagram DMs, facebook messenger, his iMessages, etc, and I didn't find anything that set off alarm bells to me. But I know from some comments that people who are cheating are good at covering their tracks and hiding messages so I kept looking around. 

I saw he had a folder called 'work', and so I looked in there, and he had a couple of Microsoft apps (outlook, authenticator, onenote, etc), but he also had MS Teams. So I opened that up and had a look around. It did feel like I might have been breaking laws looking at his work messages but I obviously had to. 

Anyway, I was already upset to see that he had a bunch of one-on-one chats with several female coworkers. Which, at first glance is obviously not an issue, because everyone works with people of the opposite gender and are required to communicate with them. But a couple of them were vaguely flirty, nothing I would call egregious, but there would be the occasional message between them with some playful innuendo or a wink emoji. These upset me, obviously, and they did send me into a bit of a spiral, but I didn't find anything that suggested he was having an out-and-out affair with any of them. Still, I followed someone's suggestion of screenshotting the messages and I airdropped them to myself. 

I still wanted some evidence of the lie, though, some proof of Josh telling someone that I was his sister directly. A commenter suggested that I go through his messages and search for keyword ""sister"" (I wanted to reply to your comment and say thank you for the idea but the post was locked (??) so I couldn't, but thank you!). So I searched for ""sis"" on his MS teams, hoping to find results for both ""sister"" and ""sis"".

A bunch of messages from all-hands group chats or one-on-one chats came up from other people, all unrelated and about their own sisters or whatever. But my heart dropped out my ass, lol, when I saw there was a direct message from Jake (the guy from the bar) to Josh from a Monday a few months ago. 

Jake's messages said: ""Ran into your sis at \[the bar\] on Fri. She's single right??"" 

And my husband had the fucking gall to reply, ""Nah, she's married."" 

I literally almost burst into flames on the spot when I saw that, I can't even describe how much I was shaking after reading those messages. Firstly that I could have confronted Josh about this MONTHS ago, I was (and still am) so furious with myself for that. Josh would have been fucking praying I didn't remember meeting Jake or that I wouldn't mention it, and he would have been counting his lucky stars that I never did. He probably thought he was hot shit for getting away with that and I nearly burnt a hole through the floor thinking about it, lol.  

But secondly, I was just in shock that he had the balls to tell this guy that I'M the one who is married, because he doesn't want anyone having it on with me, but HE is allowed to coyly flirt with every fucking woman in the office???

Anyway, I kept going back through the search results on his MS teams, and eventually I got as far back as 2-ish years ago, and I did in fact find a message from Josh himself to a group chat. It said ""me and sis in Nusa Dua"". I clicked on that and saw that he had sent it alongside a bunch of photos of him and I from our holiday to Bali. We went to Bali for our second anniversary. I thought he probably chose those photos because he's shirtless and had been working out so he looked hot in all of them. I was in tears seeing all of this, obviously. I took screenshots of those too and airdropped all of the screenshots to myself. 

Needless to say I was devastated, and still am, to see all of that. I am still struggling to even process it at all. But that all happened on Saturday morning, and I immediately took myself to my friend's house (I'll call her Sophie). I went to her place to cry it out and show her what I found, and she was extremely supportive and probably more furious than me, lol. At around 1:30pm I got a phone call from Josh, and I hung it up immediately. He sent me a few messages along the lines of, ""where are you baby?"" ""I'm ordering food, want some?"" ""sad to not wake up next to you this morning :("" 

Guys I have to reiterate how much I loved this man, and how fucking heartwrenching it was to see him still acting like nothing had gone wrong. It took so much willpower to not just pretend none of it had ever happened and go home to him. I know a lot of you will yell at me or accuse me of being terrified of confronting him about this, which is not true - please have some empathy! It takes me time to process my emotions and I wouldn't have even been able to form a sentence if I tried to confront him immediately after seeing those messages. I needed some time away with Sophie to recollect myself, and so I stayed the night at her place. She ordered us chinese and she helped me plan how I would confront him. I got a bunch more texts and calls from him as the evening progressed and I eventually put my phone on do not disturb. 

Sunday morning I woke up feeling more angry than sad, so I opened my phone and finally replied to his messages, ""Coming home now, need to talk."" I kept it cryptic to make him squirm, to be honest. 

Because I was/am fraught with emotions I can't remember the entire conversation word for word, but I'll try to replay it as best I can. 

Long story short, I got home and he tried to hug me, but I refused him and we just stood in the kitchen. I did confront him like someone suggested, I just said, ""why have you been telling your coworkers I'm your sister?"" 

I wish it would've been like a movie scene where the colour drained from his face, or he immediately looked like a deer in headlights, but he didn't. It was like he had been girding himself for this confrontation for a while, because he just frowned at me and looked flabbergasted. He just said, ""huh?"" This made me SO ANGRY. How are you going to pretend to be stupid after THREE YEARS OF LYING?

I basically said, don't play fucking dumb, TWO of your coworkers have greeted me as your sister, and I have proof of you telling them. And I know you're pretending to be single. Essentially I asked him what he had to say for himself. 

He STILL PLAYED STUPID!!! He became moderately defensive and just kept saying, ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" or, ""Why would I lie about you??"" I cannot describe how furious I was at this point, but I was in tears (I always cry when I'm angry), so he was trying to comfort me as if I was having some kind of irrational breakdown. 

I showed him the screenshot of his message saying ""me and sis"", and I said something like, ""You tell me."" 

He just said, ""I don't know what I'm looking at,"" and, ""I'm confused."" 

I got so angry that I left again, and went back to Sophie's, because it felt like a dead-end road. I didn't think I was going to get him to admit to anything and I was just getting so furious I couldn't continue. He was really upset, and in tears, which to me was evidence that he knew he was lying and that he was going to have to come up with some explanation. He tried to get me to stay, but I told him that until you have something to say for yourself, we've got nothing to talk about. 

At like 8:30ish, he called me again and I did pick up. He basically asked for us to talk and he said he has some ""things to say"", so I went back to our apartment. He had written out a bunch of stuff on a piece of paper as if he had prepared a speech and sat me down on the couch. He asked me not to say anything while he was explaining himself. I'll write down the gist of what he said in bullet points: 

* He started by apologising relentlessly and admitting that he pretended to be stupid before because he couldn't immediately think of something to say for himself. 
* He said that immediately after he started at his job, he realised the atmosphere was like a frathouse. All of his team members were men in their 20s and 30s that were single and ""fuckboys"" (his word). He noticed that the one guy in their team that was married would either get picked on, or essentially excluded from any and all social interactions (that included getting lunch, inside jokes, going out on Friday, etc). These guys were friendly and welcoming to Josh, and he admitted that he was desperate to fit in with them, he hated feeling like ""fresh meat."" So he was scared that saying he was married would alienate him from his coworkers, and at first just never mentioned that he was married. He said he did wear his wedding ring and that they had just never pointed it out. 
* A few months in, they were all out drinking after work. He admitted that after one of his work mates saw picture of him and I on his lockscreen, they asked him who I was, and in a moment of panic he said, ""my sister."" He was really apologetic at this point, and he was crying a lot, he couldn't even look at me and he was just reading what he had written down. 
* Anyway, he said that from then, he basically dug himself a deeper and deeper grave, because they kept grilling him about me and wanting to see more pictures of me. He said he had let it go on too long and that he ""didn't have the balls"" to admit to the lie. They would always bring me up and ask shit like, ""did you give her my number yet?"" or joke that they had slept with me, etc. So when he got that message from Jake, he essentially thought it was just him taking the piss, but he didn't like the jokes they were making about me and said that I was married in hopes they would stop (they didn't). He said that this wasn't the first time he told them I was married, in fact he had said so pretty much immediately after saying I was his sister. 
* He said that those pictures of us in Nusa Dua were the only pictures that he had purposefully sent them and deliberately lied about, after what he called an ""endless barrage"" of pestering from his colleagues to share the pics from his holiday. He said he was really ashamed that he did that. 
* He told me that he had never had an affair or even considered it, that the messages between him and his female colleagues were 'banter' and that it was commonplace to talk to people like that in the office. He also said he knows how disgusting it is and he is embarrassed to have been acting like a ""fuckboy"" (again, his word). 
* He concluded his speech by apologising again, and said that he was disgusted with himself and ashamed that he had lied for so long, but felt like he had trapped himself and that he couldn't find a way to get himself out of it. He said he knows he could have confessed the truth to either his coworkers or to me at any point but that he didn't because he was a coward. He said that he'll confess to his entire office that he lied and that I am his wife and not his sister if I want him to. He said that he will quit his job without a word if it would make me feel better, and that he hopes I can forgive him but he understands if I can't. 

Anyway, I couldn't really think of anything to say at that point. He went to lock himself in the bathroom, and I just sat on the couch crying. 

I still don't know if I can trust what he said, and a lie that extreme is just baffling to me. If he can lie like that, for so long, what else could he be lying about?? But his explanation and apologies seemed so sincere and genuine, and I guess to an extent what he said is believable. He has always been extroverted but very susceptible to peer pressure, especially from other blokes. If nothing else, to me, it's a sign of shocking immaturity. 

Anyway, I packed up a bag and went back to Sophie's, and I'm still at her place as I'm writing this. She said I can stay as long as I need to. I told Josh that I needed time away from him to think about everything and whether or not I believe him, or whether I can ever trust him again. He told me to take as long as I needed and that he will still be there if or when I get back, he said, ""even if it takes a year."" 

Right now nothing feels real, I'm still dealing with the emotional whiplash from all of this and I can't keep food down or think about anything. I've taken the day off work and Josh told me he's going to take off the whole week. Sophie and my other friends have told me not to make a decision on anything until my head is clear. I spoke to my parents this morning and my mum says it's just a ""bump in the road"", but she and my dad adore Josh so they're pretty biased, lol. 

That's where I am right now. I'll take some time before I consider my next steps, I can't say whether I'm leaning towards forgiveness or divorce, but those are really the only options. I kind of feel lost in a void at the moment, that's probably the best way to describe it, just emptiness. Thanks again for all of your advice and support, I'm truly so grateful, and having this place to write down all of my thoughts has been helpful to get my mind a little clearer. This will be my last update (unless I make an edit to clear things up). All the best <3"
eix14x,"UPDATE: I [35M] followed Reddit’s advice, got divorced, & have never been happier",7966,0.94,300,2020-01-02 16:47:32,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eix14x/update_i_35m_followed_reddits_advice_got_divorced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eix14x/update_i_35m_followed_reddits_advice_got_divorced/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hi, Reddit! I’m writing to thank you for the advice you gave me on [my original post, “How Do I Divorce My Wife When She Relies On Me For Everything?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cth73w/how_do_i_divorce_my_wife_35_f_when_she_relies_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) The tl;dr was that my wife wouldn’t work or contribute in any way, relied on me for everything, but for many years I was too racked with guilt to leave.

However, since that post, I followed your advice to leave my wife (which was the same advice I received from literally every other person in my life).

It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. I’ve never wept so hard as I did after I told my now-ex — whom I’d been with for half my life — that I had filed for divorce and was leaving.

But despite any pain and stress I’ve experienced in the last few months, filing for divorce was *by far* the best decision I’ve ever made, and in that time I’ve experienced a sense of lightness, possibility, and fierce joy I never knew possible.

I am happy to answer any questions y’all might have, including those looking for advice or comfort in similar situations. Here are some highlights/takeaways from my personal experience.

* The divorce process isn’t a ton of fun. I had to switch attorneys when I realized the first law firm was unethically making the process more contentious than anyone wanted to boost their billable hours, and I will end up paying a not-insignificant amount of spousal support for a couple years. But all of this is a (very) small price to pay for the freedom I now have.
* There have been emotional ups and downs for sure. Aside from one brief texting conversation, I haven’t spoken with my ex since I left in September. Old habits die hard, though, and during long weekends alone, I’ve twice been overcome with guilt about leaving and broken down in tears. I know I don’t *truly* have anything to feel guilty about; I think this is simply part of the process of grieving and extricating myself from the familiar emotional ruts I’d taken as reality for so long.
* Modern dating is STRANGE. And fun! But STRANGE! For context, the last time I was single, my phone flipped, haha, so dating apps took some getting used to. That said, I was very relieved to find that my worst fears — that I would be an undesirable guy to date and would be Forever Alone — could not have been less realistic. I often had dates with 2-4 different women per week (I live in a major city, which helps); and more than once, I found myself jokingly asking a lovely woman, “Are you sure you’re on the right date? Like, have you SEEN me?” I’m not the Cryptkeeper or anything, but I look like what I am: a mid-30s creative guy who works in tech and owns entirely too much Nintendo memorabilia. Luckily, no ladies bolted mid-dinner.
* I did not plan on dating seriously for at least six months, but I met a woman on Tinder who is my “dream girl” and so much more. We’re deliriously happy. She’s a few years younger than I am but is deeply wise, as well as hilarious, kind, thoughtful, generous, and beautiful. This sounds like I’m making it up, but she’s literally a professional model. As I joke with friends, “I swear she’s real, you guys, she just goes to a different school.”

There were many folks who reached out and said how much they related to my previous circumstances. So if I had any advice to share to those struggling with leaving a partner who is dependent on them, it would be this: Do not set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. We’re on this earth for all too brief a trip and it is not fair to make ourselves miserable just to avoid making someone else uncomfortable. Relationships should be about two people coming together because they WANT to share their lives, not because one of them NEEDS the other. And anyway, people are more resilient than we give them credit for.

Thank you so much, Reddit. You helped change and save my life. If I can repay the favor by answering any questions, please let me know.

tl;dr: Per Reddit’s advice, I divorced my SO of 17 years (we’d been married for 10), met and am dating a new woman I adore, and have never been happier.

**EDIT 1:** I think this is clear if you read both posts, but I get that most folks won’t, so just to be safe: I didn’t leave *just* because of Reddit. Everyone in my life — including friends who loved both me and my ex — believed it was the right thing, because I’d tried for years to get our marriage to work, she wouldn’t reciprocate, and the effort almost killed me. Reddit offered enormous comfort and further confidence, though, and I’m deeply grateful.

**EDIT 2:** Quick notes to address some a couple questions in the comments.

1. *What is my ex doing now?* Aside from a brief text conversation, we haven't spoken since I left. Through my lawyer, I know that she is living with her parents and is looking for work. In that text conversation, she said she hopes we can be friends and talk when this is over; she also said she understands and respects my decision to not be in contact with her. Whether or not we'll have a relationship after this process, I truly don't know. But I admire the strength it took to send that magnanimous message, and I wish her only happiness and the best.
2. *How did my ex's parents take this?* They understood completely. They didn't even ask why I was leaving: They already knew, which was both comforting and sad.
3. *What did my original lawyers do that made me seek new counsel?* Well, they weren't billing me for hours they didn't work. Rather, they were creating unnecessary work so that they could have more hours of work to bill. Basically, they were misrepresenting my ex's lawyer as being much more aggressive and litigious than he actually was. I found this out when they described an email conversation they'd had with him, then (accidentally, I assume) sent me the actual conversation as part of an unrelated email forward. The real conversation was nothing like what they'd reported. There were a lot of things like that.
4. *""You're not actually dating a model because that is ludicrous""* OR ""*haha you're dating a model, have fun paying for* her *life, too, Einstein.""* Oh yeah, totally, I agree: It *is* ludicrous. Especially since I basically have the physique of a guy who loves ordering fitness DVDs but does not love opening them. But she really *is* a model, and her looks are honestly the least beautiful thing about her. Also, she's 30 and knows modeling won't last forever, so she's already fielding offers to go back to work as a psychological counselor.

**EDIT 3:**

*5. How did my ex react when I told her about the divorce?* She was terribly upset and lashed out at me verbally. I’d expected that and don’t begrudge her for it, and I’d made arrangements for people she loves to be nearby and come over right after that conversation so that she wouldn’t be alone.

**EDIT 4:**

*6. ""Why are you in another relationship so quickly? / Have you, uh, actually* met *your new girlfriend (AKA is she even real)?""* I definitely didn't intend to get into another relationship so soon. But things have gone incredibly well so far, and I cannot wait for my new girlfriend to use the money I sent her to get her buried inheritance out of Nigeria so we can finally meet!!

(*Joking.*)

In all seriousness, these are great and totally fair questions. In fact, my friends and family (while absolutely thrilled to see me happy) were also concerned that I was jumping in too quickly... until they met my girlfriend, ""W,"" saw what I see, and fell in love with her as well. W is, in some ways, the opposite of my ex: She won't ""let me"" pay for anything outside of date-night costs, for instance, she's very independent, and she has a professional career (as a psychologist) that she's looking forward to returning to whenever the modeling time in her life is through. I'm sure I have a lifetime of lessons yet to learn, but although I will make mistakes in this (and any) relationship, I won't be repeating the mistakes from my marriage. Promise. 

**EDIT 5:** 

I've received so many messages. I'm overwhelmed by your kindness and deeply moved by your requests for  advice. To make correspondence easier to keep track of, I created an email address that anyone can use to get in touch with me in the future: GhostTurtlesFromReddit at gmail. (Feel free, of course, to reach out using a throwaway email.) 

Thank you all so much again. <3"

He makes sure to let me know how lazy I am, even though I’m the only one to care for our daughter or clean our house. He works a lot and when he comes home, he spends a couple hours on the game and he might hold our daughter for a couple minutes. He says that since I’m staying home caring for our infant alone I should have dinner made, the dogs and pig should be fed, watered (obviously), and walked. Trash should be burned. Dishes should be clean. Floor swept and mopped. His other kids rooms clean. Every surface wiped down. He also says that there ARE gender roles and this is what a woman should do to keep her man happy. According to him I don’t deserve to be loved on until I’ve finished the chores and put the baby to sleep by myself and made sure that he feels loved and cared for. Our daughter won’t take a bottle and he won’t help me with bottles so I can’t go back to work but I’m also not helping financially. He doesn’t stay up with our daughter. If I don’t initiate sex we don’t have sex. He straight up said he’s won’t touch me in ways that please me
Because he’s “not in high school”. I feel crazy. He’s obsessed with the concept of disrespect. Everything I do is disrespectful- if the dishes aren’t clean, if the floors not mopped, if I leave little trinkets around the house, if I started projects that I didn’t get to finish and forgot about when the baby woke up, or
If the baby has been a little fussy and I’m feeding her when he gets home I’m a fat lazy waste of space and why didn’t I get anything done today. I don’t text him throughout the day telling him sweet little nothings, so I must not love him. I can’t choose between being a mom and a partner even though sometimes I have to because my daughter ISNT CAPABLE OF CARING FOR HERSELF. it’s like he’s mad that I can’t be his mother for him, right?  So Reddit. What do y’all think? Please be honest because he will absolutely be seeing every word. "

Sister and I were close as children but had a huge fight over our parent's divorce as teenagers, didn't speak for a couple of years and then have had a fairly wobbly but mostly okay relationship since I was 16 and she was 18. 

So yeah. The husband and I met at university when we were 18 and had a very sappy ""love at first sight, immediately knew he was the one"" kind of romance. We've been married for nine months now and he really is my soulmate and best friend. 

Now, husband is one of those people who everybody just loves. Like he's super kind and funny and friendly and outgoing, people just like being around him and I'm used to being told how awesome he is. I also semi frequently get comments about how good looking he is. I know I'm biased, but he really is supermodel gorgeous, so those aren't surprising either. The fixation my sister has with him, however, goes a little beyond what I'm used to. 

Ever since the first time she met him she's had this schoolgirl like crush on him which borders on creepy. She talks about how hot he is but not in a normal, passing comment kind of way. She regularly *gushes* about him, especially in cases like when he gets a haircut or buys a new shirt or gets a new piercing or something. She's also made several jokes over the years about stealing him from me and how they were probably meant to be in a different life and how he mostly likes me because I'm ""basically the boy version of her"". To top it all off, she has explicitly mentioned while drunk that the only reason she fancied *her* husband in the first place is because he looks a little bit like mine (honestly the resemblence isn't really there they're both just tall and lanky and blond). I've largely brushed it off as joking but it does make me and my husband both quite uncomfortable. 

So the current problem. Two weeks ago, my sister gave birth to her first child, my nephew. And she named him after my husband. It can't even be passed off as a case of her just liking a common boy's name that just happened to be my husband's name; we live in England, but my husband is Ukranian and has a pretty distinctive name. Like, I'm sure there are other guys with his name over here and it's quite a common name in Ukraine, but I've personally never met anybody else with his name and I'm certain my sister hasn't either. I asked her why she chose that name and she said she just thinks it's pretty, though she couldn't tell me what it means and actually technically misspelled it on the birth certificate so there's that. Husband and Sister aren't really close at all so it's not like she chose his name to honour their bond and it's not like he's ever done anything extraordinary for her to warrant that kind of honour. 

Idk... under any other circumstances I'd probably buy the ""I just think it's a pretty name"" bit, but her weird fixation with him in mind it feels a bit...odd, you know? I really don't know how to feel or what to do or how to approach this. Any advice on any of it is helpful."

&#x200B;

Thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. A lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare Capgras delusion. Some of you assumed she was cheating which is something I won’t even address.

Thinking about it, Capgras really fitted the symptoms but I couldn’t just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and I just overreacted.

After they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. The psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. They told me they will look after her and I should go home to my children. I felt like i was drunk the entire time, I couldn’t close a single eye at night.

The psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. I left my children with their grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

She told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its Capgras. She never saw a case of Capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. She explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

My wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. She was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. She calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. The good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. She 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. She assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. She flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. She still isn’t sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. That explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. My wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren’t real because she didn’t feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. Writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest.

She also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren’t the real 'we'. Her delusion that we’ve been swapped came to her 1 day before I noticed it. 10 days ago. She woke up, looked at me and knew that I wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. Same with the kids, her parents and her friends. She hadn’t had those thoughts before.

She asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. She tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn’t sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. My wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she’s ok being here. It gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. It helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot.

The psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. She explained to me that it’s possible that she might never truly recover. But the fact that she opened up about it and doesn’t necessarily feel scared is a good sign. Im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. She apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. She knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. Only the thought that we aren’t the real ones is now a fact for her. Now I wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

Writing all of this down really helped me. I’m trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. I can’t hide how distressed I am and that my wife isn’t at home so I explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. The 4yo doesn’t really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. It helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. They asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. I havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

Thanks to everyone here that helped me. I feel like im in a waiting room at the dentist. Its so surreal. I feel better knowing what the problem is, but worse not knowing when it ends."
i0mo7t,UPDATE: My (23F) BF (22M) got mad at me when I told him I left my ex because he was a porn addict,7901,0.96,332,2020-07-30 19:38:51,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i0mo7t/update_my_23f_bf_22m_got_mad_at_me_when_i_told/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i0mo7t/update_my_23f_bf_22m_got_mad_at_me_when_i_told/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzdxf4/my_23f_bf_22m_got_mad_at_me_when_i_told_him_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

TL;DR! He used to be a porn addict in the past, which was the reason of his reaction, he apologized for calling me an asshole.

First, I want to thank everyone who replied and upvoted, I didn't expect this get so many attention.

I also want to apologize for some things I should have said in my previous post:

1. He doesn't like porn and he thinks the industry is evil.
2. I never specified to him that my ex didn't have any intention of changing at all, I thought it was obvious that was the reason.

I was planning on talking about it with him bringing on things people said to me in the post. However he was the one to start the talk.

He first apologized for calling me an asshole, and that he didn't fully know the situation like to call me that. He told me that his emotions got a hold of him because he actually suffered from porn addiction in the past. He told me his story and how he was deeply ashamed of his addiction and that if someone would have left them because of the addiction (which he finds is comprehensible but nonetheless painful) he would have probably just given up. After he was done I told him he could be open about it, however I clarified that my ex didn't have intention of changing, he said he already guessed it, he apologized again for calling me an asshole. He also told me that he also does understand leaving someone with an addiction even if the addicted wants to change, but his self projection didn't let him think straight in the moment.

I told him about the post and we read the comments together for a little while, he said he wanted to write his story so here it is:

""Hi, I'm OP's boyfriend, I wanted to tell my story even if it isn't necessary. I discovered porn when I was 11 or 12, with time I started to watch more and more, and I started to use it to escape from my problems, it slowly drived me away from my friends, it was like I was there but not totally, it got to a point where I would watch porn each day every few hours, I also masturbated every time I watched which hurted me physically since masturbating that much is obviously not healthy (especially at the age I was), it fucked me up in several ways, my whole view of sex was fucked up. I didn't realize I really had a problem until I was 17 and I stumbled into r/nofap (I don't even remember how I discovered it other than I discovered a week after starting to use reddit) and I saw stories about people that ruined their lives because of porn, that was when I realized how porn had affected me. It was a hard time, but I could make it thanks to my two best friends who were the only people who I felt I could open up, they also inspired me to start working out and they helped me a lot, I also met some people online who had the same struggles as me and that helped me a lot. Now here I am, I haven't watched porn (in the sense in searching seeking pleasure) in a long time, even if I did, thinking of porn brings back bad memories, my experience has made me resent porn, and it might not be exactly evil, but I still dislike the industry as a whole. I still remember the last day I watched porn, it was on first of October of 2016. When OP talked me about her ex it bringed back lots of memories, I reacted badly, I know, I shouldn't have called OP an asshole, I also know some people called me lots of things, I want to thank those people, it made further realize my response was bad. It's refreshing to write this without shame and knowing my partner is not judging me, I really don't know exactly why I'm writing this other than to get this out of my chest. Thanks for reading!""

hrnqz8,Parents want me (16F) to be jealous of my step sister (16F) over the material goods that she has. I’m not jealous.,7891,0.97,573,2020-07-15 19:10:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hrnqz8/parents_want_me_16f_to_be_jealous_of_my_step/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hrnqz8/parents_want_me_16f_to_be_jealous_of_my_step/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"tldr: step sister has a lot of stuff that I don’t. I’m not jealous but parents want me to be. How to deal with it?

So we are a blended family. My dad married her mom last year. We’re cool with each other. We get along and don’t have problems.

Her dad is very rich though and he buys all sorts of things for her. Clothes, makeups, electronics and anything else that she needs. She’ll have a brand new car soon as well.

Here’s the thing, dad and step mom are not only worried that I am jealous over these things, but they want me to be. They keep telling me that it’s awful that she has them and she shouldn’t when I don’t and it’s okay for me to be jealous or even resentful. I am not jealous or resentful at all.

My take is that I’m already very privileged. I have a dad and step mom who generally care about me, I live in a safe home, in a developed country with good future prospects. I have an appropriate level of material goods given my age, I’m not hungry, I’m healthy and able bodied, I happen to look a certain way that means I won’t face racism where I live. I have already won the birth lottery, since all the kids my age who live in poverty or are in abusive homes dream about my life. I already have a lot more than I’m entitled to. My step sister having more stuff than me doesn’t make me forget how lucky I am. And I’m not an entitled brat either.

My parents tell me that in the same house kids should live in a similar way. They want me to voice this opinion to her, so that she tells her dad to roll back on the stuff that he gives her. I honestly don’t care that she has those things that I don’t. She doesn’t deserve to have her things taken away or be made guilty about them. She’s lucky enough to be in the top 1% of the most privileged kids her age worldwide, I’m also lucky to be in the top 5%.

So how do I get this point across that they shouldn’t expect me to be resentful or jealous, and for them to stop trying to make her feel guilty over this?"

I just wanted to sincerely thank everyone who commented on my last post. I really, really needed the advice. I apologize that I wasn’t able to respond to any of the comments, it was a bit overwhelming on my end haha. But I did read them. 

I took the unanimous advice and spoke to my wife about how I’ve been feeling. It went really well! I figured it would, considering the type of relationship we have; I was more so anxious that I would make her feel scared about my abilities as a dad. But she reassured me that never for one second did I have her worried. To paraphrase her, she said that despite all of her experience with other people’s babies and children, she’s never actually had to take care of a baby that was hers, so we are in the same boat. 

Honestly it was such a relief to finally talk to her. I definitely feel lighter haha. 

Anyway, if anybody would like to know, we have recently found out (literally yesterday) that we are expecting a boy! The both of us are just over the moon. We’re planning on naming him Sidney (Sid), a name we picked out years ago. My wife actually told me that she would like to give him my first name as his second one. I wasn’t expecting that at all. Currently trying to not let it go to my head, but honestly it just makes me feel really, really awesome (for the lack of a better word haha). So his full name will be Sidney Benjamin. I think that has a very nice ring to it. :-)

Thank you again to everyone who shared their experience as a first time parent (or second time, third time, fourth time, etc. haha). Blessings all around. And I will definitely look into pee teepees now haha. 

TL;DR: happy ending!"
baec65,I [59M] cut two of my kids [24F][28M] out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance.

A few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. Over 300K GBP each, evenly distributed among them.

Prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. It was to: 1. Used to pay off debt, 2. Used to further education, 3. Put towards buying a house in future.

Two of my kids, 24F and 28M, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. My daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. I completely understand going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** Bloody shameful.

My son is even worse. He has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. None of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

So I continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. Once this happened, I decided to cut them both out of my will, as I don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

I told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when I eventually pass. One of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed I'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

I don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if I'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

Any advice on how to fix this?"

We recently graduated from our college and were planning to get a good job. She is from a very underdeveloped village and was given scholarship by the government to study. Her parents are socially backward and never contributed for her well being and were against of her education from start. Her mom is abusive and her father is an alcoholic. She is the only one in her family to graduate. Her sister dropped out of the school and works as a part time maidservant. The one who supported her through tough times is her aunt. Her aunt fought with her parents and supported her through graduation, but she later passed away last december. Now that her aunt is out of the way her parents are trying to claim her as their own. Her parents are forcing her to marry a 43 year-old for their personal gain. Basically this man is ready to offer her parents three lakhs rupees ( roughly 4354 USD) in exchange of their daughter. The man in question is very shady. He has many lawsuits filed over him and is potentially connected with the local gang members. He is avoiding his jail time because of his political connections and power. He is already married to two women 41F and 32F and has four children, eldest being a 19 year old boy.

My friend do not know what to do. She cried yesterday while being with our other friends. We are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. But she is too scared to take any actions.

If the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. She will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

I want advice about helping my friend through this situation."

UPDATE- HE IS 99.99999% THE FATHER
I made another post. You can find it in my profile.  Thank you everyone for all the advice and well wishes.

ETA: it's only been a few hours but I want to thank everyone who left a comment. I'm trying to read as many as I can. I definitely needed some different perspectives. I did take the test yesterday and the results should be back by Friday. I will update after that. I'm grateful for all the advice and will consider what you have all said. I still don't know what's going to happen but I really want to make this work. 

I 37(f) just had a beautiful daughter with my partner 36(m) last Tuesday. She is perfect and we absolutely adore her. My partner is so happy and was very supportive during pregnancy and labor. Everything was perfect or so I thought. We have only been together for 18 months and things moved quickly for us. We started living together after only 3 months and have been inseparable since. Even working in the same factory together until I went on maternity leave. My partner and I are both recovering addicts. I have 3 years and he has 2 1/2 years sober. We have completely turned our lives around and have the life I never thought possible. There has never been cheating on either side but yes there can be some jealousy issues. Now that you have some history here is the problem..we came home from the hospital Friday and I was exhausted so he took the baby while I slept. When I wake up he says you know I love you right?"" I immediately get worried the he says he wants a DNA test because he counted the days and when I got pregnant he was in jail.( he is still on probation and was driving with out a license)This is not true I got pregnant 2 months after he got home and the cherry on top is we were actively trying to have a baby. I'm absolutely devastated and automatically felt different about him. I was tired and emotional so I just cried. He is saying he doesn't trust me and I am angry now. We went yesterday to take the test and he paid $200. I'm not working and that's money we need. Our baby has jet black hair and he has blonde hair blue eyes. Mine is dirty blonde. He says he just wants to be sure and has issues because of past relationships. I feel lost and unsure if i will ever feel the same about him.I don't have anyone to talk to about this because i am embarrassed, so I came here. Thank you for any advice. Sorry so long.

Tdlr: me and SO actively tried to have a baby then after she is born he wants a DNA test. Need advice"

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/isnvxh/update_my_37m_gfs_34f_daughter_13f_falsely/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

We've been going out for the best part of 2 years. It was going amazingly well and because of lockdown, we moved in together. She has just the one daughter and I always thought we got on well. 

Last week, I got home from work and I noticed her and her daughter we're not in. I didn't really think it was strange, but I then was contacted by the police asking me to go in and see them which I did.

Basically, her daughter accused me if sexually assaulting her. I didn't if course, absolutely denied it and the police asked me permission to search my house which I did. They examined the daughter, didn't find anything and she basically was interviewed and admitted she made it up. She admitted her dad, who's a real wrong un, was telling her she needed to say that so it could get me out the picture and he might be able to be back in her life - he's not been in it for a while and hasn't long started to make contact and spend time with her and we've noticed she's changed a bit lately. Acting out, being disrespectful that sort of thing. If I ask her to do something, ""you're not my fucking dad"" etc. 

Naturally I'm relieved but I'm angry, upset, and just really confused. My girlfriend made contact, saying she wants to move back in and we look into picking up where we left off. I told her no way, because I can't trust her daughter yet and don't really want to be around her and I'm not sure I want her living under my roof. She said she's only a kid, and I shouldn't hold it against her and was being manipulated - I know that's true, but I can't look past how horrible it was. She also says as a mum she did what she has to do and as horrible as it was, she'd do it again in a heartbeat so can't say she apologises. I mean I get that, but it doesn't make anything easier and I can't apologise for how I feel too. 

So here I am, I don't know what to do. She's staying with her mum until we can talk but I genuinely don't know what way it'll go. Do I take her back and move on? Or shall I cut my losses?

Edited to add it's bad enough what happened. What's making it feels l worse is that I feel like she should be a bit more empathetic and apologise at least for what happened and what the kid did. But she's not doing that. 

Edit 2 Jesus Christ. I'm not a police apologist or anything but what is it with people in this thread and the police? They did a great job, investigated properly and my name is cleared and I have no further involvement with them. I just don't understand why people have a problem with me stating the facts or even not being negative about them?

Tldr: GF's kid accused me of sexual assault and it later was admitted she made it up. GF wants to get back together and I'm not sure I want to.

Here's the update seeing as it's been removed. 

I broke up with her.

Thank you all honestly for all the advice and reassurance. I honestly already knew that I wanted to finish it ever before my last post, but i just needed others to write it out to verify it in my own mind. 

A few people said ""why is this even a question?"" Well in all honesty - it was mainly because I'm not the most self confident of guys. You see even though I'm told I'm a great guy and a good catch (I've only ever been in 3 serious relationships and sexually active with 7 women including her and she couldn't believe it when I told her I'd been single for a while before I met her) I don't have a lot of confidence with women. So I was genuinely weighing up if I should stay with her as I might not meet anyone else for a while and might not be able to do better as sad as that sounds. Plus, I was worried if I do meet someone else - how do I explain how my last relationship ended? ""Oh yeah me and my ex didn't work out because her 13 year old daughter accused me of fingering her and I didn't ever want to see her again. But she later admitted it was false and her dad out her up to it and the police cleared me. I'm totally innocent, honest!"" So I suppose looking at myself, I've got a lot to work on before I consider dating again.

So to elaborate on the break up but keep it salient, I told her to come over last night. Said to her I agree what she did was right by her daughter and I would do the same if I had a child that told me that but I think she's out of order for not apologising what I've been through or showing me any empathy. I said I can't trust her daughter anymore, and don't want to be around her or have her in my life so that's it, I'm finishing with her. I also said there's too much drama - I don't want her ex interfering in my life. I didn't sign up for that. 

She started really crying, saying she's so sorry etc but I told her it's too late, she should have done that as soon as she knew I was innocent. I told her to go back to her mum's and think about how she wants to get her and her daughter's stuff back, and call me in a few days when she's decided. More tears, but  she then after a while if it would make any difference if her daughter apologised? I said no, I never want to talk to her again - I'm especially done with her. And I explained why. 

Not only am I so angry with her, I can't trust her. And what she did, makes me angry for another reason too. Basically I was sexually assaulted as a child by an older male family member when I was 7. It fucked me up for a long time. So to have someone lie about something so disgusting, it fills me up with a lot of rage. She (my ex) had no idea - I never told her in our relationship at all. If she knew, she would definitely have apologised. I got so annoyed about that - like why does knowing what I went through make me more worthy of empathy? Does not ruining your boyfriend's life make me less of an apology? I went off on a rant about that, I was so pissed off. 

So after I had my rant about it, I told her to leave and we'll talk in a few days about when to start collecting her stuff. 

I feel mixed - justified in ending it, but sad it's over. Like we were amazing up until this. Really started to bond as a team. Lots of good moments. My dog's missing them too, he sat by the door crying after she left. 

EDIT! Just to get this out the way - let stop with this ""you let the father win"" or ""he's won"" talk. He's not really won anything! He's alienated his daughter, ex hates him and the police are looking for him. Not only to mention if he happened to cause me or my family any more trouble or bother us again, it'll end up very badly for him. He may have ""won the battle"" but he's certainly ""lost the war.""

Tldr: told her to come over, said we're done, explained why and we'll talk soon to arrange her getting their stuff."
euoyzn,How do I (24M) convince my sister (31F) that I don't want to fuck her fiance (~30M),7765,0.99,507,2020-01-27 20:27:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/euoyzn/how_do_i_24m_convince_my_sister_31f_that_i_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/euoyzn/how_do_i_24m_convince_my_sister_31f_that_i_dont/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,,False,"I know the title sounds strange. I’ll try to be concise with all of the context. I [24m] have a sister [31F], and due to the age gap, we were never close. We grew up in the US, but after college, my sister moved to Europe. I haven’t seen her much since she was 18 (and I was ~11), but because we weren’t very close, we were fine with the occasional texting and every-other-year Christmas visits.

 

Two very important pieces of context for this story. The first is that, even with the age gap, we look EXTREMELY alike. In the few times she’s been home since I was older (~16 and ~23) people have commented that we could be twins. The second is that I am 100% straight. I’ve only ever dated girls, and have never been interested or experimented with men in any way. I’ve been with the same girl since I was 21.

 

Ok, so onto the main story. About a year ago, my sister met her fiancé, who I’ll call Rob. I met Rob for the first time this Christmas. We quickly bonded over a shared hobby (Runescape, lol). We chatted a ton while he was here, and because it was Christmas, we were usually drinking. He seemed a little touchy (touching my arm / my back, laughing a lot, a few oddly-timed hugs). I thought nothing of it, maybe that’s just how Europeans are (I’ve never been).

 

Anyway, they went back to Europe just after New Years, and Rob and I have been casually chatting on WhatsApp (mostly about video games). Then one day, he stopped responding to my messages. A few days later, I asked my sister if he was OK. She said yes, but she needed to talk to me. We agreed to FaceTime the following night.

 

To keep it short, here’s what my sister told me. Rob found me extremely attractive. Apparently, because he’s attracted to my sister, he also found me attractive (we look a lot alike), and is now questioning his sexuality. Like... I was some sort of gay stepping stone?? My sister said they are going to work things out, but she asked that I stay away from Rob. I figured I rarely see them and this was all bizarre, so I agreed. She also asked me to promise I’d never fuck Rob. Which is insane, because not only am I straight, but the implication is that I’d fuck my sister’s fiancé unless I was told not to. I told her she was being ridiculous, and I’d never do that. We got into an argument because I wouldn’t specifically agree not to fuck him. I asked why HE wasn’t being held accountable, it should be HIS job to leave me alone. He’s the one who wants to fuck me, I’m not attracted to him at all!  I was told I wouldn’t be invited to her wedding. She hung up on me after I told her Rob would probably cheat on her with someone in Europe if she wasn’t even sure he wouldn’t fuck her own brother.

 

It’s been about a week since this happened and IDK what to do. We haven’t talked since. Neither me or my sister has told my parents, but it will definitely hit a boiling point when wedding invitations go out. What the fuck do I do? Should I apologize and promise I won't fuck Rob to smooth things over?

Also, just to be clear: I find nothing wrong with being gay/bi, or anything else. None of this post is coming from a place of me being upset for being ""accused of not being straight"" or something like that

EDIT: I'll be speaking to my parents about it tonight, mostly because I'm worried my sister may try to frame this situation differently. I'll be showing them this post, as well as the message Rob sent me since I posted here. Will update in a few days."

a1oz57,My(M36) wife (F43) thinks I couldn’t be attracted to her and therapist agreed?,7751,0.95,863,2018-11-30 09:39:09,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1oz57/mym36_wife_f43_thinks_i_couldnt_be_attracted_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a1oz57/mym36_wife_f43_thinks_i_couldnt_be_attracted_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Background:

Married a little over two years, after dating a very short time around 3 months. 

We meet at a work event and I was immediately smitten with my wife. It was like out of a movie I saw her chatting with a group of people and in my head I heard “oh there she is”. She was newly devorced and took some convincing on my part but we have been together from that night on and get along extremely well.

Now for clarity I am extreamly attracted to my wife, we may just still be in the honeymoon stage but I’ve never felt this way about another women. And becasue it’s pertains to the conversation we had today with her therapist I would say the majority of the population would find her attractive and not in a niche way. She is objectively attractive. I feel we are evenly matched in looks, very few people have notice the slight age difference. She however wins in personality (outgoing and charming) and she makes about 3X as much money as I do. 

A couple months ago we ran into an ex of mine, and by ex we literally dated for maybe a month and never exclusive. After my wife mentioned how different they were (age/hair color/body type etc) and it ended in a pretty heated argument. We have had 3/4 conversations since, all of which I was trying to convince my wife I’m not going to leave her for a women I “dated” years ago. 

Last week she asked if I would go to her therapist with her today and I agreed. She has been seeing her for about 8 years for anxiety and a bout of depression that happed before we meet.

Today:

Started normal enough and I had figured why we were there so I just jumped into it thinking the therapist would be on my side and would help me calm my wife’s fears. That’s not what happed.

The therapist did very little talking although their long silences and knowing glances started to piss me off right away.

The thing that stood out to me the most was how my wife reiterated how she doesn’t see how I would be attracted to her and the therapist didn’t even disagree. Like I felt like a crazy person, my wife is beautiful, charming, funny, it feels like I wished her into existence.

She brought up the age difference (7 years?!?), my looks, and how quickly I wanted to get married as all reasons for why I am basically a gold digger. 

First off we both wanted to get married quickly, I asked and figured she would want a long engagement but she didn’t so we got married. Second I never even discussed money with her until after we were married and never dreamed she made so much more than I do. She said she doesn’t think I’m after her money but enjoy the lifestyle while I’m with her and it makes it easier to pretend I’m attracted to her. Sorry more attracted to her, like I play it up. 

I’m completely blind sided and don’t really want to talk to my family or friends, it’s humiliating being accused of marrying someone for a lifestyle.

For clarity: I moved into her house, I rent out my old home but that income just covers the mortgage and the company that manages it. All our money goes into a joint checking with automatic transfers into savings etc. Our bills are paid from that account, I looked at our bank account and I spend significantly less than she does each month on average. 

After leaving I’m in a complete panic that she is going to leave me, even though I feel humiliated and love her so much. I immediately wanted to offer to sign a prenup or separate bank accounts or both but I just froze.

My wife seem so sad and I’m so frustrated, I didn’t even do anything wrong. The women I’ve dated in my past don’t have a similar type and to be honest I didn’t really date, more like hook up for a few months then moved on. I love my wife, she is the first women I have ever met that I have had a real partnership with, like we were a team and now that’s all gone. 

I don’t feel like I have the strength to leave her, it scares me that I can’t even envision a scenario where I would leave. She is my most favorite person.

How do I rebuild trust when I don’t feel I ever did anything to lose it. 


Edit: My wife didn’t come home last night but I texted her this morning. First apologizing for leaving the session and then asking her to come home so we could formulate a plan. No word back yet but I doubt she will check her phone before lunch if she went to work. 

Thanks for letting me vent, I’ve already asked my insurance company to send a list of counselors for me to call later today. Hopefully I will find a good fit as I don’t even know how to go about picking one.

Edit 2: I need a referral from my general doctor before insurance will cover a therapist/psychologist, I have an emergency phone appointment Monday and will being seeing someone by myself.

My wife didn’t return my text but did come home about an hour later. Honestly I cried for the first time in a long time, but was able to get across how seriously I take her concerns. I haven’t mentioned anything about her therapist or my feelings about things just apologized and asked for another chance to hear her out completely.

She said she was really drained and is taking a nap, I don’t think she made it in to work and am actually looking forward to having the weekend to talk. I’m not going to ask for couples counseling until I talk to my own therapist. 

This is probably it unless I fuck things up this weekend. Thanks for letting me type out my feelings and being honest even the hard comments were helpful."

He had a pulmonary embolism, we had no idea he had any clots in his legs and it was very sudden. I called 911 immediately and did everything I could, but he passed away in my arms and I felt completely helpless.

Two days after he passed away his family completely cut me off. They took everything of my partners from me and even some of my personal belongings too. They took all of his clothes, our shared electronics, shoes, undies, bathroom stuff, photos, and furniture….even our shared dog of years. They have not picked up any of my calls and I have no idea if they have even laid his body to rest yet. His brother texted me that he will not pick up any call or tell me what is going on. I found out how my fiancé passed away from one of his coworkers telling me. I went almost 2 weeks not knowing what caused it because of the lack of communication from his family.

Three days after he passed away I took a pregnancy test since my fiancé had been making jokes to me that I might be pregnant for a few weeks before he passed away due to my nausea and fatigue. I took 6 tests and they all came back positive.

Since we were not married yet I have no legal rights to anything and have been left with nothing. I feel very scared and alone. I'm not only mourning the death of the love of my life and losing everything we built together for years, but I'm carrying our child. This is the first time I've been pregnant and l'm not sure what to do. I have a doctors appointment scheduled for next week.

Do I tell his family I'm pregnant? I initially wanted to because I want this child to know where his or hers father came from, but with how I've been getting treated I'm now feeling very hesitant to tell the family. What if they fight for the rights to my baby? I don't even want to tell them anymore because of how they are treating me since his passing away."
bif0xb,UPDATE: I (48 M) don't know how to be a dad to a child (1 year M) I never wanted.,7679,0.94,380,2019-04-29 01:03:35,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bif0xb/update_i_48_m_dont_know_how_to_be_a_dad_to_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bif0xb/update_i_48_m_dont_know_how_to_be_a_dad_to_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"While it's only been a few days since I posted I think I've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. I've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. I had a lot to process. A lot to figure out. I believe I was in a bit of a panic when I posted. I feel calmer now since reading each and every comment.

I know now more than ever that I was never meant to be a dad. I certainly never wanted to be dad. Yet here I am, a dad. That will never change. My son is here and he needs me more than I need the life I'd originally planned for myself. He needs me.

Admittedly I've been a very hands off father. Not truly involved nor invested. If anything I was peeking through the window of fatherhood. Or better put, having one foot in the door and the other out. Neither here nor there. Mostly watching from afar.

I think my fear of him and what he represented in my mind drove me away from him. It made me avoid him so I could avoid the overwhelming feeling of ""what have I done"" and ""my life is over."" I think avoidance made things fester, made my fear and dread grow, and that painted a dark cloud over everything.

Still, I feel heavy weight of loathing for the future and I mourn for the life I wanted, even if it is selfish. I realize these feelings they need to go. I need to move on. Grieve in a sense and push forward and forget how things could have been. They simply are not and will never be.

I sent my wife away yesterday so I could spend the day with my son. My first day alone with him. Maybe that's pathetic. Maybe I'm a terrible man. Maybe I'm a terrible husband. Definitely an awful dad.

I wanted to experience him in a way I hadn't before. Alone without being able to hand him over when he frustrated me or I was bored. 

Honestly the day went shit. We both had a tough time. He wanted mom and so did I. There was this moment though when I sang to him ""I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas"" and he laughed so damn hard. I've never made him laugh like that before. It wasn't miraculous or revolutionary but I did feel this little spark inside me. This little ""I want to do that again"" sort of feeling.

I've done what a lot of you have told me and I've reached out to a few therapists. I have an appointment for next week and currently waiting to hear back from two others. I want to shop around and find a good fit since I know I need this. I feel ashamed admitting such a thing. I feel embarrassed. I for some reason even feel emasculated too. 

There are also a lot of unpleasant things I feel when I look at my son. What I've utterly failed to take into account is what I see, which is the epitome of innocence. From that I learned that I need to seperate my feelings from him. Whatever negativity I feel is not his doing, that is all me and my fears surrounding him. He is not the source of my feelings. He is a trigger and I need to fix that.

My son is innocent and he needs me. This is the truth.

I'm not leaving. I've resolutely decided that I'm not leaving. I'm never leaving. I need to pack up that fantasy and put it out of my mind. My wife needs me. My son needs me more. He needs me. He needs me. He needs me. I keep telling myself this. He needs me. He needs a dad. I have to be all in because in the long run being all out seems like such a worse fate for all involved.

I want to touch on a few things before I wrap this up...

Saying I love my wife is a profound understatement. She is all my hopes and dreams rolled into a package of femininity and determination. I married her for the long haul not just until things didn't go my way. Nowhere in my vows did it say if we accidentally create a child everything we've gone through is null and void, my love will disappear and I'm out. 

Some people said she betrayed me. I've never felt betrayed. The baby wasn't planned. We even took steps to terminate but her heart said no and I respect that. I respect her and I respect her choice. She made the decision she could live with.  Unless you or your spouse has been pregnant and you've considered all your options your opinion really isn't relevant. Watching my wife go through the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones while battling with not only her desires but mine... It wasn't an easy decision for her. She didn't just suddenly decide she wanted a baby. She agonized over the decision.

The child is mine. Some called that into question. He is mine. There are personal factors that I don't want to get into, but I know without a doubt he is mine. And, yes, I have since gotten a vasectomy. I'd attempted twice in the past and was denied. They were hesitant because I was young and childless, then it was because my wife was still young and we were childless. Maybe I could have better searched for doctors but in the end we chose to go with an IUD.

As to where to go from here? Well, I'm a dad now. I have been for a year. There's no changing that. I must learn how to be a good one. My son needs me. I've ordered some parenting books for fathers. I've been researching some groups to join for fathers as well. I've also been contemplating cutting my hours at work. I typically work 10-12 hour days. I don't think that's feasible anymore. I'm a dad now and my son needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me.

He needs me."

He said it feels like he has lost his ""treasure"" He's upset that some nurses saw me naked and is uncomfortable with me, pulling out my breast to feed our new baby when people are around. He told me he has lost a lot of love and trust in our relationship because of this. He says it feels like I cheated on him. it really hurts me because there's nothing I could've doneand it up having to get an urgent C-section. I wasn’t dilating past 8 cm and my epidural failed It was really excruciating for me mentally and physically, and feeling like he wasn’t there for me just made it so much harder . I was just trying to give birth to our baby. Our relationship hasn't been the same since we don't live together so I've been staying at my mom's house since I've had the baby and he's only come to visit twice and when he was here, he said he doesn't feel comfortable laying next to me. He doesn't want to cuddle me and we hardly kiss anymore.

I've always taken it as a compliment, but I still wear makeup every day.

Yesterday, while I was prepping my face to apply makeup, my boyfriend suddenly came up behind me and threw my foundation bottle onto the floor. 

It smashed everywhere, including on me and I screamed. Mostly because I was so shocked and confused. 

My boyfriend seemed a bit regretful, and told me he had done it to show me how I don't need makeup at all. I didn't know what to say. I was literally stunned and even a bit scared. I left the room without saying anything.

I really don't know how to feel. Obviously it was a bad idea for him to do it. It was dior foundation so it cost a lot. But I really can't decide whether it came from a good place. Was it a misguided attempt to show me he loved me? Or was he just backtracking after making a mistake?

I'm really not sure how I should feel. I'm not sure if I'm overacting. It's not like he threw it at my head or something. But it does feel off.

 What should I do from here? 

TLDR - My boyfriend broke my foundation in an attempt to prove that I'm pretty without it, should I be upset with him?

**EDIT - I have broken up with him, and asked him to pay for the foundation. Thank you for all the helpful comments who helped me realise what I think I knew deep down. His behaviour is a red flag."
ipkjom,My (27F) best friend (28F) told me she was having an affair with my husband (28M)… I don’t believe her.,7634,0.99,854,2020-09-09 23:02:05,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ipkjom/my_27f_best_friend_28f_told_me_she_was_having_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ipkjom/my_27f_best_friend_28f_told_me_she_was_having_an/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Yesterday, my best friend of forever, came to my house to tearfully confess she had been having an affair with my husband. She gave me a lot of details including the places they slept together, how often it happened, when it started, etc. She was very apologetic but told me she had to tell me the truth because her daughter (1F) deserved to know her daddy. Honestly, I was in shock and didn’t say much.  

I haven’t confronted my husband yet as he works long hours and I went to sleep before he got home. 

The more I think about it, though, the less I believe her. For one, when I asked her to show me proof, she claimed she would send it to me later, but she still hasn’t done it. There’s also the fact that when my husband first asked me out my best friend tried to discourage me from dating him, she did the same thing when he proposed and if I ever mention even the slightest disagreement she insists I should get a divorce. She also admitted to me after we got engaged that she had been planning to ask him out before he asked me out, but she took too long. There also hasn’t been any signs that my husband is/was having an affair. 

I know I’m going to have to talk to my husband about this, but I want to do it in a way that doesn’t sound accusatory. How do I do that?

Also, do I sound like I’m in denial? 

TL;DR – my childhood best friend told me she was having an affair with my husband and that his baby is hers. She still hasn’t shown me the proof I asked her for and I’m starting to doubt her claims.

Update: I spoke to my husband. I told him there was a rumour going around that my best friend’s daughter was his, he seemed confused but not suspicious."

Last week I posted on my regular account about date ideas for the girl I was seeing who's in a wheelchair. The post was capped off at 1000 upvotes, so I thought I'd post an update on a throwaway account, as a few people asked and wanted to know how it all went. 

&#x200B;

First I would like to say thank you to all the wonderful people who commented and gave me so many great ideas, especially the one who suggested the 4wheeler, as that was hilarious. However, for the many people who thought it was a fantastic idea to pm me unsolicited sex advice, first off, I'm concerned for your reading level as I pretty clearly stated we were both women. Second of all, whoever you are who suggested that thing with the three chairs, I... I can never unread that.

PREVIOUS POST:

I've started dating this amazing girl (both of us F20's) who happens to be in a wheelchair. I don't know any other wheelchair users so my experience is pretty limited in this regard. Recently as the world has begun opening up again, we are talking about going out on a more 'official' type of date, as now when we hang out it's usually at her place just talking, playing games and watching TV. Thing is the city we live in is NOT designed with wheelchair users in mind, every place I like going is five steps up or five steps down. I really want to take her out on a date where she doesn't have to do all the planning, so, any ideas?

Now on to the update!

I did like many of you suggested and we went for a picnic in the park, where I had bought us ice cream and we just hung out, played games and chilled with her dog. Which was absolutely lovely.  Now the thing is I'm absolutely incapable of keeping my own secrets, so I pretty much immediately told her about the post, which we had a laugh about. She thought it was pretty cute, and we basically came up with a bunch of great date ideas together, though I do plan on keeping some ideas up my sleeve for a later surprise. Now we have a date planned where we will make her favorite food (lasagna) and buy some cheap wine and do an amateur wine tasting. Down the road I really wanna take her to this fancy restaurant where I plan on visiting ahead of time to make sure everything is accessible as many of you suggested. All in all I just can't wait to spend more time with her, as she truly is amazing. The last few days I have been really stressed about exams and how the world is falling apart, so she bought me flowers and made banana bread,  so yeah, she is absolutely the best. 

Hope you all are doing well, and once again thanks for the amazing advice!!"

Me and my wife has been married for 3 years. First let me say my wife is not struggling with any issues that i am aware of and we have known each other since grade school. We literally know everything about each other and families.

About 2 months ago, i came home and found my wife and 6 months old daughter on the couch.

My wife was asleep and my daughter next to her, the moment i went in to greet them i smelled my daughter immediately. She needed a diaper change, i didn't know how long it has been since her last diaper change.

I took my daughter from the couch to go an change her diaper. As i didn't want to wake up my wife, my wife doesn't sleep during the day so i know that if i find my wife sleeping during the day or any time before 9pm she had a hectic day and is just drained. 

I walked into my daughter room and placed her on the changing table and started to change her diaper. 

Not even 2 minutes later my wife walked into the room and as i greeted her, she looked at me and looked down to my daughter on the changing table and went into a rage and started to attack me. 

I was stunned for like a second and instinct kicked in and i leaned over my daughter to protect her. 

My wife was shouting while hitting me, how could i, how could i, over and over again and that I'm a monster. I had no idea at the time what she was talking about and the morning i left everything was as good as it could be. 

She then ran out the room, like 5 minutes later, 3 police officers had me in handcuffs and my wife going crazy that she caught me SA my daughter. I was speechless at that moment and  couldn't believe what see was saying 

I ask her what she was talking about. 

All she kept saying is that she saw me diong it. 

I was arrested, and released the next day when the police had a look at the camara footage in my daughter room clearly seeing that i was just busy changing her diaper and nothing happend, there is not evidence that to support my wifes claims abd she attacked me without provocation.

I want a divorce as i can't believe she would even think that i would do something like that. 

I haven't spoken to her since i got released and my phone has been blowing up with calls and text with her apologies. 

I honestly don't care about that, the moment she said those word to the police, that i SA my daughter it was like all the love i had for he just left me and all i feel is a viod inside of me at the moment nothing els.

I had her served with divorce papers a week ago and now everyone is constantly harassing me from my family, her family,  our friend to talk to her and try counseling to sort this out.

She can get counseling if she want but i will not be involved.

I am giong for full custody of my daughter. 

My lawyer has informed me that i will most probably get full custody of my daughter due to my wifes violent outburst on camara and that i had to shield her with my body and the false claims laid against me noting her mental state.

Everyone is saying im taking things to far by divorcing her, and trying to take my daughter from her

But nobody, can give me a reason as to why she did wat she did, she herself in the 374 message hasn't given me an explanation as well, just constant sorry, and we can go for marriage counseling and individual counseling again i dont care she can go by herself. 

Im just worn down at the moment as the gravity of everything is hitting me.

What should i do ? 

Everyone is on her side, what am i missing?"
fxb1fo,I heard my roomate moan my name,7585,0.93,913,2020-04-08 23:14:16,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fxb1fo/i_heard_my_roomate_moan_my_name/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fxb1fo/i_heard_my_roomate_moan_my_name/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"(NSFW) (updated)

Yes i know this may sound like a total p*rn video plot but i promise its real. I wish it wasnt.

I (f20) moved out for college and found a nice apartment near school with two other rooms. A little pricey but i was antsy to leave home so i just worked hard along with school. I met my roomate when he (m23) and I met up to talk about the apartment and he showed me around it, what would be my room if i decided to move in, and told me that the landlord wasnt bad at all. My roomate is a cool guy, very nice and not bad looking, but because i was there for school and that was my focus, and since hes my roomate, i never considered him in any way other than friends. 

Anyway, the whole virus thing has had us locked up in the apartment. We can only go out for essentials or work, and his job deemed him nonessential, so hes been home a lot. I got home from work yesterday and i guess he didn't hear me because i could hear him masturbating in his room (thin walls.) I was surprised he didnt stop when i walked into the place but i just tried to ignore it and stood in the kitchen on my phone for a few seconds, until i heard him moan out my name. I froze. I was not sure if i should laugh or cry. I opted for laughing, and i couldnt keep it too quiet so i walked out and laughed in the hallway, far away from our door. I calmed down and walked back in, extra loudly, and i guess it worked cause he walked out the room a few seconds later and said ""oh hey, did you just get home?"" I lied and said yes. 

It slowly sank in through the night. What he was doing. As we were sitting there in the living room on our phones i just couldnt stop looking at him, things felt awkward. 

Im not sure what to do, should i ask or should i ignore it? Wtf does it mean? 

Id love your insight.

Edit to answer some of your questions.
1) my name is not common, and as far as i know, im the only one with this name that he knows, and he hasnt mentioned having a friend with the same name
2) ive been thinking that maybe he had headphones in as some of you suggested and maybe thats why he didnt hear me the first time
3) this account is older than my post because i regularly make throw aways and was planning on posting on another thread and just didnt didnt end up doing it. I wish i could make this up and it was a lie because it would save me some stress, but its not lol
4) idk if he moans out names regularly when he is having sex or if its just when he masturbates, but i agree that its an uncommon practice, which just makes it weirder
5) some of you are saying maybe he has cameras and it would surprise me but i guess its a possibility, albeit a tiny one
6) i still have no fucking clue what to do
7) we are both pretty respectful of our own rooms and i havent noticed any of my clothes (undergarments or otherwise) missing so I wouldn't throw that in as a possibility
8) some are saying that its weird i heard him jacking off, and maybe it is, but through small moans and gasps and the weird fast shuffling sounds of fast movement, it was pretty obvious what he was doing
9) some of you asked if hes heterosexual, as far as i know he is
10) when i stood in the kitchen i wasnt deliberately trying to listen in on him, just was in my apartment, you know, the one i live in.
11)my relationship with him is quite friendly, i wouldnt say we are super close but i dont just consider him as an acquaintance, he is definitely my friend, ive been living here for over a year now
12) on the possibility that he might see this post; i dont think he is on reddit, its never really come up as long as ive lived here, or at least not that i can remember

UPDATE; 
I didnt expect the post to blow up but i guess it served me to get lots of different opinions and ideas. 
Ive been reading a lot of your responses and advice and i appreciate that so many tried to genuinely help me. A lot of you claimed its fake, i cant, and dont really care, to change you mind but thanks for pointing out that this is in fact a weird situation. 
Ive thought about it, and despite some of your suggestions, ive decided to just leave it be. 
Boring, i know. But i guess its the best course of action. A lot of you have suggested cameras or that he is stealing my clothes, i highly doubt it, but ill be a little more careful about my clothes, the privacy of my room and how easy it would be for him to find any of my intimate stuff. 
Sorry to those of you that wanted the big exciting outcome where i ask him or where i go into his room next time i hear him do it, but i wont lol. 
Im not really interested in him in that way, and even if i was, i wouldnt want to try since i wouldnt want to put my apartment (which i love) and a good roomate (clean, fair and so far respectful) at risk. 

Unless this happens again (at which point i would make another post or update) then im just gonna try and swiftly move on.
Thanks again."

Her boyfriend unexpectedly died in an accident about two weeks ago, which has made her so sad that she can barely function.

The day after he died, she knocked on my door at like 3 AM. When I told her to come in, all she said was ""I can't be alone in my room for one more second"". Then she climbed onto my bed, got under the sheets, and went to sleep. I didn't protest or say anything, I just let her do what she wanted.

After that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. It was the same situation each time. She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed and go to sleep. Sometimes she'd say something like ""talk about anything to distract me until I fall asleep"". She doesn't sleep in my room every night anymore, but she does it every few nights. She did it two nights ago and I'm pretty sure she'll do it again.

I have a king sized bed so it's not like she's too close to me or anything, we don't even touch all night and it doesn't really make me uncomfortable, but I'm just wondering if this is normal for someone who's grieving. Also, should I tell my parents? She asked me not to but I don't know what to do

Edit: Umm...woah lol. I didn't expect this to get more than like 20 responses, but thank you so much for all the advice and insight. I'm reading everything but responding to it all would be impossible. Also, for all the people asking if my sister's in therapy/suggesting she should be: she is"

1f2umej,My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I’m using his ex’s words against him?,7545,0.98,448,2024-08-28 04:17:27,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f2umej/my_28f_boyfriends_30m_ex_hid_a_note_about_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f2umej/my_28f_boyfriends_30m_ex_hid_a_note_about_his/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway account because I don’t want my boyfriend to find this. I posted this elsewhere but thought this subreddit could help too. 

I (28f) and my bf (30m) who we’ll call “Steve” have been together for 2 years and have  been living together for 8 months. I was cleaning our apartment when I found a note in the back of a cabinet. For context sake, I’ll copy it below:

“Dear Steve’s Future Girlfriend,

I know it’s you reading this because he’d never clean back here. I’m putting this here because I’m leaving him soon and want to warn you about him:
1. He will not clean
2. He will not listen
3. He will make everything feel like it’s your fault 

It’s not your fault, he’s just an incompetent man. I’m leaving him, I suggest you do the same.

Best wishes,
Natalia “
(name changed)

I read the note and brought it to show to him and hear his response. He immediately ripped it up and said not to listen to it, that she was crazy and untrustworthy. I told him that the fact that he hasn’t found it in the 5 years since they broke up is a red flag to me because it does mean he’s never cleaned back there and that he has been cleaning less and less since I moved in. He told me that it wasn’t a problem before the note, this is just his ex continuing to manipulate and ruin his life and I was letting it work. We continued to argue along the same lines and I eventually left to spend the night at a friends place. 

Steve has been a great boyfriend so far. He gets along with my family. He has given me gifts and flowers and always tells me how much he loves me. He’s not wrong that the cleaning hasn’t really been brought up before, the note made me realize it had been less and less and that we needed to have a full conversation. He texted me afterwards saying he’s sorry that I felt like I had to leave but that it’s an asshole move for me to take a note over our 2 year relationship and to leave him and our pets alone.

I don’t know what to do or what to believe right now. I’m contemplating trying to find and reach out to Natalia, her name in real life is pretty unique so I think I could find her. Steve thinks I should come back home and let it go, that his past should effect our future. I feel like I could be the asshole because everything Steve has said about Natalia does make it sound like she was manipulative and petty throughout their relationship, but I don’t know what to trust.

Edit: I realized I didn’t clarify enough about the points, especially the cleaning. thought I’d add it here:

When we moved in together 8 months ago, the cleaning was 50/50. Since then, he’s been doing things less and less and i’d say it’s at like 70/30, maybe 60/40 if he listens to me right away (it depends on the week). I have to remind him to do things like bring his plates to the sink or take out the trash and I didn’t have to before. The dishes will pile up unless I do them, to the point he’s had leftover food mold on the plates. I’m not a confrontational person so I was just asking him to fix it when it came up. The note made me reflect on it more and try to have an actual full conversation, and I will say I didn’t feel listened to when I talked to him about it. I tried to use the note to start a conversation about cleaning and he got so stuck on that I was listening to his ex instead of him, that he wouldn’t listen to what I think are valid concerns. He thinks I’m letting the note have “confirmation bias” so no matter what he says I’ll think he’s in the wrong.

Also, I didn’t leave him permanently, this all happened yesterday and I only spent one night at a friends because I didn’t feel like our conversation was going anywhere last night and he wouldn’t let me sleep until I let it go. I’m going back today and wanted to get advice and feedback before I do.

Edit 2: I appreciate all these comments with advice. I’m heading back to our place now. My plan is to first apologize for immediately bringing him the note without thinking of his feelings and validate 
that it’s hard to have an ex’s message found.

That being said, you’re all right that I’ve been letting the cleaning stuff get away. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I have to ask him repeatedly to clean. It was pointed out to me that he should’ve cleaned the shelves during his move from his ex’s place, the fact that it hasn’t been touched in 5 years is forcing me to take the not seriously. I don’t want to throw away 2 years so I am going to ask him to come up with some clear cleaning expectations with me and designated chores. I will make it clear that cleaning is absolutely a deal breaker for me. It’s his decision on how he wants to respond. 

I’ll try to update you all. Again, thank you so much for the advice. 

UPDATE:

I followed your advice from the last post and tried to have a calm discussion with Steve. When I apologized for confronting him with the note, he seemed to take that as an admission of guilt and refused to listen to anything else. I had come up with a list of specific instances of not cleaning like many of you suggested, and he said I was using lists just like his manipulative ex did. So yeah, the crazy ex thing you all said was a red flag was definitely true. 

When I realized the conversation wasn’t going anywhere, he even tried to block me from leaving. That’s when I knew it was done and left immediately. 2 years down the drain, but I’m glad I had the wake up call before it was too late.

I will let him cool off and then will ask my brother to come with me to grab my things while he’s not there, he has a strict work schedule so I think it’ll work out. I am planning on leaving a note there, but probably a little longer with the advice to not show it to him. I’m leaving it in the exact same place, so if he doesn’t learn his lesson about cleaning, it’ll come to haunt him. All he has to do is clean.

The biggest surprise out of all of this is that I didn’t reach out to Natalia, she reached out to me. Apparently he borrowed his friend’s phone to call her screaming that she’s ruining his life still. The fact that she blocked him and he still had her number memorized just further confirms he was the crazy ex not her. 

Natalia found me on social media and wanted to make sure I was okay and was especially concerned that he’d gaslight me like he tried with her. I thanked her for leaving me the note and saving me time. We scheduled coffee for Thursday afternoon. 

I wanted to thank you all again for the advice, especially the person who posted the love is respect website. I took the healthy relationship quiz after our conversation and it wasn’t great. You called out how he was weaning me into an unhealthy relationship so well. 

For now, my friend said I can stay until I find a new place. I have emergency savings and a decent job, so I’m in a privileged place when it comes to this messy break up and am just trying to feel grateful for that

Just posted my final update separately, thank you all for everything"

I think I’ve realized already that I’ve become someone that just exists for him. I live just be to his wife and the mother of his kids. I spends hours cooking everyday and I clean ritually. I stay in shape and I always do my hair and makeup. “No” is not in my vocabulary when it comes to sex. I wait on him hand and foot when he’s home. I’m always nice to him. I don’t complain or vent about my issues to him. His peace and happiness is my priority over everything. I’m honestly low key a miserable person but being like his servant scratches a itch deep inside of me. Pleasing him and our kids is the only thing that fills my emotional cup. I just didn’t think I was so far gone as an individual that I am ready to just forget about him literally sleeping with and spending money on other women. I’ve suspected him of cheating before of course it’s not like it popped up out of nowhere, but I never cared to go looking. Curiosity eventually got the best of me and I went searching today while he was at work and I found solid proof. I thought it would hurt to see it right before my eyes but nope I feel fine and I don’t get it. 

I believed ignorance was bliss and knowing he was cheating would be a big problem for me but I don’t feel that way. This is making me rethink my sanity. I imagine him sleeping with other women and it doesn’t make me flinch at all. I feel absolutely no different than I did before I found out. Is this normal at all? Am I insane? How do I handle this situation when I don’t even know how to feel? I have good friends and I’m close to my family but I’ve never been satisfied in life before I found him. Why could I almost “want” to be treated like this? I kinda just want to pretend to be mad and confront him so I can fake it till I make it, I just don’t know it that would be a good choice or not. I need advice really bad.

Edit: Insulting me won’t make me listen to your advice. It’s just going to make me shut down and give up wanting to change."

I’m going to try to keep this not too long. I’m pissed so things may be jumbled.  I knew my wife was messaging men while she’s manic (she is bipolar) but she’s remorseful and says it means nothing once she’s stable. 

Two days ago I came home to get something I forgot and I walked in on them. It wasn’t my finest moment. I went into a rage and hit him . I told my wife to not be there when I came home. She went to her parents and I have contacted a lawyer to divorce her. 

I know him and his wife well. We double date a lot and this is her best friend since they were kids. Do I tell his wife or do I give them the chance to? As of now, she doesn’t know anything about this.

ETA: I told his wife and she was devastated. I don’t like being the one to break the news. She’s not letting him come home and will likely divorce him. 
I think I’m still in shock from walking in on it. I can’t get that image out of my mind either. At this point, I’m telling everyone I can."

Apologies for using a new account lost the password to the other one. So after two weeks I’m comfortable enough to share the aftermath of that bombshell. First off, I went to go see my campus councilor. Issue was, it was a she and I had difficulty getting into details of my feelings about the whole mess. She was really understanding and helpful and got me in contact with a friend of hers who does pro bono work. He’s been a real help.

I’ve told my new friends/roommates. While we had effectively just met days beforehand, they were willing to hear me out and offered their concerns.  We played games afterwards, which really got my mind off the matter.

I’ve also checked my financial matters as my family were the ones paying for most of my needs like food and all that. Turns out I’m in the market for a job so that’ll be fun /s. Better than relying on others tbh.

Lastly, I opened Pandora’s box and asked my mom (not my “dad”) why they decided to tell me NOW of all times. She had trouble giving me an explanation other than that she felt it was “the right time”. I can’t fathom what would constitute a “good time” to tell your kid that your the progeny off his biological older brother, but whatever. That was six days ago and I’ve not spoken to her since. I’ve decided not to tell my younger brothers, god knows I want to, out of respect for their ignorance. They’re wondering why I’m avoiding mom and “dad” and I just keep telling them that it’s a complicated matter and that it’s be better for them to ask again when they’re out of the house. Honestly, the whole situation is fucked up, but I’m pulling through. I won’t let it define me. I’m in college now and I’m off to make a life for myself. Thanks to those who offered their opinions and words of kindness, you’ve been wonderful.

EDIT: so there’s a lot of responses coming in and I’m trying to reply to them as much as I can, but it’s late right now, I’m tired, and I’ve class in the morning. I’ll try to reply to who I can tomorrow but I want to say thank you all for your encouragement and kind words. Have a wonderful rest of the week. Go Chiefs!

EDIT2: holy shit this blew up overnight. I don’t think I’ll have enough time to go over every comment and post a reply. A majority of questions have been answered so I’ll say look there. Thank you so much for all of this support, it’s been wonderful."
1ex5oup,My (21F) boyfriend (26M) says cumming in me is a boundary what should I do? ,7471,0.94,2167,2024-08-21 01:42:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ex5oup/my_21f_boyfriend_26m_says_cumming_in_me_is_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ex5oup/my_21f_boyfriend_26m_says_cumming_in_me_is_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,True,False,False,"UPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Y6FaicbhSs

I (21F) have had an IUD for the entire time and my boyfriend (26M) have been together and it has caused me nothing but problems with my hormones and severe cramping at random times and my period is extremely irregular.

Since I’ve had an iud the whole time we’ve been together I have always let him and wanted him to finish in me during sex. Now since I’m getting my IUD removed and it is recommended to not have sex for a week before getting it removed to prevent pregnancy me and my boyfriend have been arguing about it nonstop. 

I have a very high libido (so does he) so I’ve been asking to have sex still (with protection or at least for him to pull out) and he says no (which is fine) but stated that the reason he’s saying no is I’m “breaking a boundary because he needs to cum in me” and by not letting him cum in me “I’m hurting him”. He’s getting upset because I keep trying to initiate sex but I insist on using protection which he “doesn’t believe in using”. 

Last night we got into another heated argument about this and I went outside for a walk to take a breather. When I got home I guess he didn’t hear me come back in because when I walked into our room he was bawling his eyes out crying with his dick out and watching porn. For context watching porn is something I’ve never been comfortable with and he promised me he doesn’t do it. 

The more that I think about it I feel like this is his way of getting back at me for “breaking his boundary”. Now I do feel bad because I kept asking because I've been super horny and he told me its a no unless he can cum in me and I keep pressing him on the topic but I feel like he's being unreasonable, and its like well, what are we going to do once my IUD is out? I guess we’ll never have sex again.

EDIT: I feel really stupid right now after reading everything you guys are saying I'm going to talk to him tonight once he's off work and i’ll update later 

EDIT 2: After talking to my girlfriends and reading everyone's comments here I've decided that I'm definitely going to breakup with him tonight. He gets off late tonight and ill update as soon as I can. Thank you guys for all the advice so far."
irtt4d,My (26f) boyfriend (24m) has been distant since my ex (26m) sent him our old sex tapes and a dick pic,7424,1.0,855,2020-09-13 12:52:28,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/irtt4d/my_26f_boyfriend_24m_has_been_distant_since_my_ex/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/irtt4d/my_26f_boyfriend_24m_has_been_distant_since_my_ex/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Happy Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iwc1zg/update_my_26f_boyfriend_24m_has_been_distance/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Background: 

I was with my ex since high school and we were together for 7 years from 16-23. He was this big ""alpha male"" jock who always had to prove he was the manliest. He was especially proud of his dick which was a little over 8 inches long (he made me measure it). Great, right? Nope. His idea of good sex was jackhammering me for 10 minutes till he climaxed. Never went down on me. Never finished me off. Not once. I had to do it myself. The worst part? IT HURT. He wouldn't use lube and I was rarely wet enough so girls out there can imagine what kind of pain I was in. When he was extra rough, which was most of the time, he would take pride and see the fact that I can't walk properly the next day as a sign of a job well done. 

But wait... There's more. We were also in an ""open"" relationship where it was only open on his end. Why did I agree to it? I was young and stupid. He'd have sex with multiple women and take pictures to show me. As you can guess, it was a very very abusive relationship. The icing on the cake was when I found out he sends our videos to his group chat for some sort of tribute thing I don't understand. I only found out when his 2 newer friends told me when they saw I was crying in one of the videos. They helped me get out and move a few states away. I still keep in contact with those two via email every now and then and I'll be eternally grateful to those two. 

The issue: 

After almost 2 years of therapy dealing with the aftermath of the abusive relationship, I was finally over my ex and decided to date again. I was working as a waitress one night and found a guy who was apparently stood up by his blind date. Don't know why, he was cute! He talked to me during my breaks and waited for my shift to end. We ended up having burgers after and we've been together ever since. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of my ex. Typical introvert like me. He's also significantly smaller than my ex (probably less than 6 inches) BUT is infinitely better. My boyfriend can actually make me orgasm and for the first time, I actually enjoy having sex and it doesn't cause me pain and oral actually goes both ways. He's so, so much better than my ex at sex. He knows about my abusive ex btw. We had a long discussion about it when we talked about each other's past and he actually cried for me. 

We've been together for over a year now and after my lease expired 2 months ago, I moved in with him. It's been great so far and the move has only made us closer. We've been so happy up until about a week ago when he started acting distant. We're usually very affectionate towards one another but every time I initiated something, sexual or otherwise, he would turn me down. Every time I asked him what was wrong he would just say it wasn't me, it was him. He's been really sad lately so yesterday I decided to actually confront him and he spilled the beans. 

Apparently, my ex found out about him and got his Facebook profile. My ex, being the douchebag that he is, sent my boyfriend a couple of our videos and a picture of his junk and said ""I'm pretty sure what you have can't satisfy her like this one can"". 

My boyfriend said he felt insecure and emasculated. Like he wasn't enough and how much better my ex was. How small he felt after seeing my ex. He said it didn't help that my ex was bigger and more muscular than he was. He said that it was his problem that he was insecure and he needed to figure it out on his own. I tried telling him how much better he was than my ex (which is definitely not a lie) but he wouldn't listen to me. He's sleeping on the couch right now. 

Now I don't know what I can do. I don't want to lose a good thing cause of my stupid ex. And yes, before you suggest it I already plan on contacting a lawyer. That's not the main issue here. 

Why won't my boyfriend listen to me? Why won't he understand that I'm with him for a reason? Why doesn't he believe me when I say that he's better than my ex? Why doesn't he listen to me when I say size doesn't matter? What can I do to fix this? I miss cuddling with my lovable nerd. I can actually see us getting married in the future so I definitely want to fix this. 

Any advice please?"

Meanwhile the niece is receiving therapy. English is not my first language so please bare with me.

For context my brother is a lot older than me and we never really connected, yet he was/is a mama's boy and our mother encouraged us to see each other. I obliged because our mother started developing Parkinson's disease and I didn't want her upset over her darling boy and second son not talking. I've always known my brother to really like chatting up women and people called him a 'sex pest' 'creep' or a wannabe 'lady's man' yet never in a million years did I think he would have a thing for or do anything to children. People still believe he is innocent. Another thing to mention my brother is a very confident person, calculated, and manipulative, very few people can tell he's lying.

With my gf we dated for a year, moved in together and had a generally normal relationship. My brother of course tried to hit on her multiple times and she brushed him off then told me which caused major strain with me, my brother, and mother. Especially because my brother and mother tried blaming my gf, yet I know what my brother is like and my mother is in denial about it. For a period of time I banned him away from our house. However later my gf's sister, BIL, and niece came to stay because her sister was pregnant with the second child and we were discussing leaving the niece at our place because the baby was going to require surgery and a hospital stay after birth that could last up to a month.

We decided to keep my gf's niece with us for the time especially so the niece could stay with her aunt. My gf and niece are fairly close so we thought it was a good idea especially with the baby while both parents were stressed and worried. Then my POS brother had to fuck it up like the cunt he is. My mother started hounding me over allowing my gf's family over but not allowing my brother over so I obliged under heavy supervision he was around. My brother was being mysteriously nice and well behaved, he also was buying us things, playing games with the niece so she actually did like him and was excited when he was around.

My brother then decided he was a handy man and helped with minor adjustments to the house, he would find excuse after excuse to come over to the point I was finding it partly daunting. My gf just ignored him and I didn't realise he was losing interest in my gf at time. When everything came out the signs became clear mainly after what occurred. In a very short period of time my gf's niece started becoming sad which we thought was because she was missing her parents so we bought her lots of toys, read to her, took her on trips to beach, zoo, shows, let her stay up, watch her favourite shows, and so on trying to make everything fun as possible. What we didn't notice was my brother was sometimes alone with her for very short periods of time which he used to his advantage.

It all come out when my gf noticed her niece was oddly quiet in the bath her niece is usually singing and splashing in the water, (my girlfriend went into the kitchen to get a cup or something it was only a few minutes), my brother was meant to be outside helping in the garden, I was in the garage when I heard screaming. I ran inside and my gf was beating up my brother who was trying to restrain her. I held onto him and my gf grabbed my niece and locked them in a room then called the police. My brother was saying he didn't do anything and ""accidentally"" walked in on the niece then my GF attacked hence I knew immediately he was lying. The police arrived and arrested him.

We found out my brother was actively grooming the niece then started getting physical with kissing and inappropriate touching, then my GF found him molesting her niece in the bath tub. He would use whatever minimal time he had to get to her, sometimes the amount of time he used was so brief it was like he was enjoying the thrill of possibly getting caught. With the bathtub incident he was meant to be outside and like the snake he is he waited for an opportunity to strike. It wasn't like the niece was left alone for hours on end, the door was left open so my gf could hear her while she went to get something then comeback. The niece is in primary school and can be left alone for brief periods of time. No one thought he would be doing this.

When we went to court several women came forward about sexual harassment from him, he would target women in his workplace or close by him with behaviour that he could try excuse, he was a peeping tom, and he would target women when they're drunk offering a ride home or something. It literally came off as a game to him where he pushed boundaries and limits to see what he could get away with. Shockingly he apparently developed a form of humanity and admitted to what he did to the niece saying he has never done anything to a child prior and wanted see what it would be like. Just a horrible person. 

My mother refuses to believe he did it and I went no contact with her because I'm honestly sick of her shit. I later remembered when my brother and I were children he was the golden boy and she paraded him around like an item, he could do nothing wrong and never had consequences for his actions. It's also the main reason our parents divorced because she refused to see what she was raising and wouldn't allow our father to get him therapy. I'm pretty sure she's a narcissist who raised a sociopath. I had moved in with our dad after the divorce because I hated the pair of them and before our dad died in my 20s, he told me how our relatives would always talk about how lovely and kind I am yet say they would 'keep an eye' on my brother while my dad said no matter what he did he couldn't feel love for or from my brother as if it was just missing from him. That of course scared me yet 15 years+ later when I'm in my 30s and my brother is almost 50 years old it was sort of lost on me.

Now with the relationship with my girlfriend. We have been sleeping in different rooms with limited talking. Her family basically blames me and my entire family and to some degree my GF. My gf told me she cannot face her sister because she feels as if she failed her family and ruined her niece's life when it's my POS brother's fault. I feel as if I ruined my GFs and her niece's life because of what my brother did. I'm trying to get us both into counselling/therapy while my gf has requested leave off work and I am preparing to too. After everything was said and done with my brother in prison, being home is utterly horrible and I have no idea what to do to even slightly repair this. This is the first time I've cried in years and I feel terrible for my GF's niece, gf, and GF's family. I do not know what to do next, I also keep wishing I terminated my brother when I had the chance. I have never hated anyone more in my life while I think my mother should be locked up with him."

Secondly, she's vision impaired. I don't know whether or not it's partial or complete[EDIT: Found out it's something like 20/600] but I know it's obviously enough to mention. With this I'm looking for some advice on what I can do to help out and make life a bit easier without coming across like I'm just ""helping the disabled kid.""

Lastly, in general, I'm guessing it's a terrifying experience going and living with a new family and having to adjust, so I'd like anyone who's been on either side of the experience to give me any advice on how to act/things to do/not do to make it a pleasant experience. I'm guessing she'll be trying her best to make things work and I want to do the same."

We have been married for 9 years, dating for 12, and I thought they were happy years.

My FIL drunkenly admitted that my husband had fled the morning of the wedding with the help of his friends. My FIL got wind of this and dragged him back and told him to either marry me or tell me he didn't want to but not to leave me at the altar. He chose to get married.

I had no idea about this. My wedding was a very special day. I felt beautiful and extremely happy. I knew my husband was a bit tipsy but he had reassured me it was just nerves

I felt completely numb. I talked with other members of the family and with my husband. He admitted that he fled because he was afraid of the future and what ifs. He didn't want to marry me but he didn't want to embarrass me either.

We have a framed picture of me at our wedding before the ceremony. I know now there is no similar picture of my husband because he had left. We also have my wedding dress in the closet.

The wedding was one of the few times I felt beautiful. I'm much plainer than his exes but love made me glow. But now I just see a naive woman.

I walk past the wedding picture every day thinking about it. I can't open my closet without seeing the wedding dress in its sealed bag. I tried hiding them but I kept thinking about it.

I didn't want to be reminded. So I threw away the picture. I donated the wedding dress. Some bride will feel absolutely beautiful in it. That gives me happiness.

My husband saw that the framed picture was missing. I admitted I threw it out and donated the wedding dress. He completely shut down. How do I reiterate to him I don't want any reminders of the wedding? I hope some bride out there will give the dress a new happiness"

Update to this post.

The comments helped me calm down a little, I really needed that. I was really stressing tf out. And yeah I know I'm stupid, didn't really think my actions through.. I did went back to her soon after my post and well, we cried hah. We've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. So she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what I wanted before making a decision. And well yeah, I pretty much realized I don't know why we're NOT dating.. Lots of common interests. Always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. Good chemistry in general. But I honestly thought I was only interesting as a FWB to her, because of our age difference. But apparently (lucky me) not. So I told her I want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.

 One thing she said stood out for me. She is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. And starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. And she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously I feel the same way. So yeah who knows maybe she or I will change our mind but this is the plan for now. Luckily abortion is legal in my country. Thanks for the advice everyone. On one hand I'm ridiculously happy that I'm now officially with her, like I honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.  But yeah the situation kinda sucks. And yes we'll be using condoms.."

A couple of seconds after we started he pushed me away from him and told me I didn’t taste good. My self-esteem was honestly crushed because that has always been my biggest fear. I’ve had multiple partners in the past and it has never been an issue. I get tested frequently so I know I’m clean. I also try to eat pretty healthy. I don’t understand what the problem was but I have not been able to stop thinking about it. My sex drive has plummeted and I don’t know if I’ll ever be open to receiving oral sex again. After he said that I got extremely upset and stormed out. He followed me and wouldn’t let me leave until we talked. He said that he believes “honesty is the best policy and that no one can handle real honesty these days.” Part of me thinks he has a point. I do want someone to be honest with me but should there be a limit?? It’s humiliating to even post this but it has been eating at me and I want others’ opinions on it.
j0qybu,My ex-Wife (F38) and I (M38) divorced because I was infertile and unwilling to use a sperm donor.

She is a primary-school teacher and was a doula for her sister's births.

We started trying when we were both 28 and had been married for 5 years. After 18 months without success we both got fertility testing.

I was found to be infertile. I went through several diagnostic procedures and treatments that, frankly, I would like to forget. I was told the odds of me conceiving naturally were close to zero. We considered IVF, but the specialist said it was not viable. The whole episode took about 5 years from beginning to resignation.

I was upset, but my ex-wife was devastated. She was briefly hospitalized for an acute depressive episode in 2015. It did not help that her younger sister had 5 children by that time.

My ex-wife wanted to use a sperm donor. I understand that biology isn't everything, but despite counseling and my best efforts at rationalization, I could never moderate the feeling of revulsion at the idea of choosing to raise another man’s child. I knew I could never see the child as mine… maybe a stepchild... at best. My SIL called that toxic masculinity. ;(

So... unstoppable force meets an immovable object. Deal-breaker.

We divorced in 2017. It was a strange divorce, we both loved and supported each other throughout. We were still living together until about six months after the finalization, when my ex-SIL started finding men for my ex-wife to date. I then made myself scarce.

We briefly reunited numerous times during the next year and are in each other’s wider social circle to this day. As I understand it, she has had no long-term relationships since our divorce, and surprisingly, no children.

In mid-2018 I met my current GF. I revealed my infertility early in the relationship. She said she always thought she would have children, but she was young enough that by the time she was ready, maybe they could fix me. I pointed-out that this was setting-up both of us for future heartache, but I had fallen for her, so I wasn't going to argue.

In April this year she missed her period. When the test came back positive, her first reaction was to go into full panic mode and swear she had never cheated on me. I never doubted her but realized that’s what every cheated-on partner says. But hey, you can now get a prenatal paternity blood test as early as 7 Weeks. Who knew?! The baby is mine, we are both delighted.

I went to a fertility doc to see if anything had changed. It hadn’t. How did this happen then? His answer: ""you won the lottery"".

Part of my problem was that the few sperm I did produce were deformed, so we have undertaken every available prenatal screening. This is also why we have only told 4 other people. But now we have the all clear. 

I share numerous friends and acquaintances with my ex-wife. We cannot conceal this from her. I know her, and although it has been two years since we were close, I know this will devastate her. My GF knows all the history and is totally supportive. She thinks that telling my ex-wife before she finds out is the right thing to do.

How should I go about it? Should I contact my ex-wife’s sister or mother so they can be there? Maybe write a letter they can deliver? Tell her to her face? Ick.

I do not want to cause my ex-wife any more pain than is inevitable."

Tl;Dr I’m free

I really want to thank each one of you who commented on my previous post. This wasn’t a decision I took lightly and it took a great deal of swallowing my pride. 

I would like to say I dumped him as soon as I read everyone’s comment about him being abusive. Unfortunately it took me a bit longer to come to my senses. The following things happened after my post...

I tried to talk to him about being unhappy and saying he needs to leave. He told me to shut up and leave him alone. I told him I’m not leaving until we finish talking. He started to do the dishes and he said if I didn’t shut up he was going to start to break a dish for every word I said. I didn’t stop talking. He threw a bowl at my feet and I stepped in glass. He started profusely apologizing after he realized my foot was bleeding. He telling me he loves me. I stupidly forgave him.

Later he called my work screaming at me to get the fuck home. I kept asking why? He told me get the fuck home now or I’m going to kill myself. I start crying and freaking out because he has the kids and I hear the baby crying. I start asking is the baby ok? He says shut up and get the fuck home. Hangs up. I panic and leave work right away. I try calling him the whole drive home (20minutes). I’m panicking thinking my children are in danger. I come home and it turns out the baby pooped in his diaper and things got a little messy when trying to change him.. I was like are you serious? I told him I understand he was stressed out but he can never call me like that at work ever again. He called me selfish and a cunt.

When I realized in that moment I feared him hurting my baby.. I knew this had to end. Regardless of how much I thought I loved him. If his mom stopped watching the kids.. I’d figure it out but I couldn’t do this my whole life. I was exhausted physically and emotionally. I didn’t care if I was alone forever because no one wants a single mom of 2 kids.. I just wanted to live in peace. 

So the day I did it. I couldn’t talk to him in person because he would twist my words around and I did not want to be subjected to more violence. I wrote him a letter. I wrote down everything I could think of. I recalled every memory of him that has scarred me over the last 8 years. I told him I already do this alone it’s time for me to actually be alone. With the letter was my ring he gave me. I told him don’t fight this. You can contact me but only to see the kids. I had packed a bag and went to my parents. I told him I would gather the rest of things in a few weeks.

It’s been hard. I wake up in panic thinking what have I done but then I come to my senses and realize how calm I feel. I don’t feel like I’m walking on egg shells anymore. I don’t even care if he’s right and no one else wants me. I’m happy again. Thank you reddit. I don’t think I would’ve finally gotten the courage with you guys. 

Edit: wow I did not expect this response. Thank you so much for the support. I just wanted to clear up some things.
I will not be going over alone. I originally planned on bringing my dad but I did not know about the police escort. I will definitely have to look into that.
I will not let him have his children alone. I will drop them off at his parents house for him to visit with them.
I didn’t realize when I posted my original post that these were abusive tendencies. I thought because he wasn’t physically abusive it didn’t count. Once people started telling me that wasn’t the case I realized this had been going on for over 5 years. He punched holes in all our houses. Have thrown several dishes. Screamed at the top of his lungs at me. Once called me at work because he locked himself out of the house while I was at work. I told him he could either go to his moms for 2 hours or wait for me. He started spamming hate texts saying fuck you bitch, cunt, whore, etc. when I ignored his texts he started calling the phones at work saying the same things. 

Lastly people are saying why I had kids with him or why I couldn’t see how bad this was. Well because I was with him since I was 15. From 15-20 it was great. He was my first love. First everything. I had nothing else to compare it to when the anger started. I thought every relationship had its issues and these were mine. He told me I was the crazy one when I would say something. I love my kids and never regret bringing them into the world. They gave me a purpose.

Thanks again.."

I am truly grateful! The past couple weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions. I have been able to engage the services of a great divorce lawyer and I was advised to not let my husband know that I knew of his affair. 

I was then finally given the go ahead a few days ago, and well at first he refused to admit to anything, but I was prepared for that and I showed him all the online posts his mistress made. I also showed him pictures taken by my investigator. He still denied it. Then accused me of being insane. Then after hours of me just throwing evidence after evidence at him, he finally admitted to the affair. He tried to twist things so that he could weasel and lie his way out of it but I was relentless. I did not let him twist reality and make me doubt the plain truth. We argued all day and all night, it was exhausting. The next morning he tried to get on my good side because I woke up to him having made breakfast and he was begging me to not hate him and to find it in my heart to forgive. I told him I could not and that I wanted a divorce. That brought on the waterworks and he called me a heartless and a unforgiving bitch. He then left to take his things to his parents house as I had asked him to leave. 

While he was at his parents I went to his mistress’s home. My sister went with me (she waited in the car) and well she let me in and we talked. She wasn’t even surprised I was there (I had already suspected she was aware of him being a married man but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt). She was actually gloating when she told me about how in love he is with her, how good he is to her boys and how he bought her the house, the car and all the other money he spent on her. She then told me if I wasn’t such a lazy bitch and gold digger he wouldn’t have been so easily taken and how my lack of submission and servitude was the reason he cheated (how am I a lazy bitch when I’m the primary parent and homemaker is beyond me and how am I a golddigger I don’t understand as I work and earn more than him). As she was flapping her gums, he arrived and he was pissed off at her. (he was calling me a ton and I had texted him that I was at the mistress’s house) They argued as he told her not to speak to me like that and he in no uncertain terms told her that he wants to be with me, that she’s ruining his chance at saving his marriage. I just thanked her for being forthcoming and continued to laugh my way out of the house because yes my husband makes great money but as his business partner I own half of his business and as his wife I own half of all his other asset’s. So I am glad that she gloated and that she confirmed that he paid for most of what she has. Now I know for certain that he nor she deserve an ounce of my sympathy, and I will take back everything he ever gave her, and much more!"

My mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is dating Zach. It was really stressful when he moved into the house with us, he's bossy and gets pissed off easy.

I started keeping a diary to vent, and every day I'd write in it and talk about what was going on in my life. It helped me cool down and relax when I was upset.

A few weeks ago, stuff got really stressful at home and I decided to put together a list of stuff that upset me and go to the school counselor for advice. I wasn't expecting her to get very involved, I just wanted to talk to someone. My best friend has talked to her about coping with her mom's death and she said she was very kind and helpful.

So i went to the counselor and I'd made a list of the things that Zach did that made me angry, because I wanted to be prepared to talk. I tend to clam up if I have to talk about personal things, and I didn't want that to happen.

So I brought this list that I'll copy here:

- Zach yells easily if he doesn't get his way. At me, at other people like the Applebee's waitress, the cashier at the Walmart, etc.

- Zach is big on ""making up"" even when I'm not ready; he will make me hug him even if I'm still mad, because he's over being mad and wants to make things better.. even though it doesn't work that way

- Zach doesn't respect my privacy, he want though my drawers and got mad because I had panties that he thought were ""too sl*tty"". I've got to hide my diary outside the house because I don't trust him to not read it.

- Zach is judgemental of my friends, how much money their families have or don't have. He says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth

- Zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy I was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger

- Zach is an aggressive driver and I won't go in his car

Anyway, I told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. She asked about my diary, and I said I had more detail about all of this in my diary, I'd show her those pages if she wanted.

Showing her the diary was easier than talking for me. So i was happy to.

And after that, things went down hill. It seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. And she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.

When I was at home and Zach was yelling at me about something, I let it slip what I'd done. I told him to shut up because CPS was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.

He got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. I'm not sure what will happen. Plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can I do?

TLDR - I am rely stressed after talking to s school councilor about my step dad. They made a cps report and i think they're assuming things are worse than they are"

update: 

Before I get too carried away I would like to thank everyone who weighed in on this. I didn’t expect it to get much traction and I really appreciate the amount of you who commented offering your own insight. A lot of the comments made me laugh too- so thank you for that. 

I honestly don’t have a crazy update that a lot of you seemed to be expecting. I talked to Nick, I explained to him exactly why this whole situation made me so uncomfortable (ty for all the kind redditors who simply suggested doing that). I also expressed to him that their lack of an explanation made me all the more uncomfortable. He said he understood exactly where I was coming from and we seemed to get a better understanding of each other after the talk. He told me that M had apologized more throughout the next day- she had said that her and her friends were beyond smashed and they thought it would be a funny thing to do to FaceTime all their guy friends and ask to see, well you know. (So to those of you in the comments who suggested Nick was not the only one who got this call- you are correct!) She also went on to explain that because they were so wasted, they didn’t realize how awkward it was until nick said “M- op is RIGHT here”. Additionally, their mix of “it was an accident” and “we meant to call someone else” explanations sort of make sense now- when you consider just how drunk they were and the fact that they were in fact calling several other dudes tha night. M also offered to call me directly and further apologize. (All the contact her and my bf had throughout this conversation was him texting her and he showed me afterwards). I didn’t really think that was necessary. I did not want to draw this situation out more than it already had gone on, I feel as though she’s sorry enough, and she does not have my number anyways (for those who are probably going to say she should’ve called anyways). At this point I kinda just wanted to be over the whole mess. I did however ask my bf if he and M (or any of her friends) had any sort of relations prior to meeting me. He said no and I believe him. (Full disclaimer- I never thought I would be posting this on Reddit- but I met my bf when he was 19 and he was not very experienced with women. Not even in the kissing dept. So yeah- I fully believe him- he was even a bit insecure about his inexperience when we met). The rest of the girls (Ms friends) never apologized other than M texting saying something to the effect of “we’re sorry”. Because I don’t know them that well, and because they *probably* just feel super uncomfortable about all of this, I’m not going to ask for an apology. I will however think of them slightly differently, and probably prefer my bf not go to any parties/social functions they might be at. No hard feelings, it’s just the whole incident paired with them not really holding themselves accountable (unlike m) kinda rubs me the wrong way. I will say that because they did not make the call, they probably hold themselves to be less guilty than m(which is fair), but I can’t help but feel like if I were in the situation I would still reach out to apologize for the boundaries crossed. Oh well. 

For those of you who kindly suggested Nick may be cheating with M- I *highly* doubt it. I have been cheated on once before (perhaps I should’ve included that in the original post, as it might’ve added more context to why this made me so upset). Anyways- I’ve been cheated on before and I do not see any of ‘the signs’ in Nick. I also think he would have to be pretty skilled if he were doing this- as M has been living in college for the past few years (hours away from us) and Nick and I have been together almost 24/7 the past few months because Covid is still so bad in our country. And above all else- I trust Nick. I do not think he would do this. 

And finally- to answer the question everyone has been dying to know- yes. my boyfriend is particularly well endowed (I don’t know that I’d call it a ‘soup can’ as someone kindly suggested in the comments on my other post) but yeah. it’s fat. So their request to see his ‘fat d*ck’ made me all the more uncomfortable. When I finally worked up the nerve to explain this to my bf he laughed, and then immediately started blushing. Gotta love that guy."

Eventually she starts talking about one of them as if he’s “like you.”(me) again no big deal. But I start noticing her being sketchy with her phone (hiding it when she’s talking to him while I’m around...etc) she only uses Snapchat to talk to him so when I confronted her about it there was no evidence and she claimed there was no wrong doing...but the fight had already occurred and I broke trust telling her I’ve been watching how she hides her phone...etc. Since then I’ve worked though my insecurities and had accepted that things may not be what I thought they were. But as of recently I found myself in a position where I saw her taking a photo of her legs while naked in a tub, I watched longer and noticed she was talking to him about our personal life such as  turnons and turnoffs. I want to confront her but after the first breach of trust/fights I’m scared she’ll shut me out again, and say I have no proof because of fucking Snapchat and that’ll be the end of us.

TL;DR: wife gets close to a coworker, I confronted her and said I saw that she was hiding her texts, there was a breach of trust/fight. Let it go, things were good, caught her snapping him tub pics/talking about personal stuff."

Over the last several months I have been trying really hard to lose weight and get healthy. I’m now below what I weighed when I met my husband and look pretty good. 

Ever since this change, my husband seems happier, we have sex more, and he is generally nicer and more romantic with me. 

This makes me literally hate him. I can’t stand behind around him and try so hard to pretend everything is ok. He says nice things to me or does nice things and I have to leave the room to go cry. 

All of this is because I’ve lost weight. I’m so so devastated that he’s treating me so differently. I feel like he never really loved me.

We've both been divorced. I asked for a prenup protecting my existing assets: two rental properties (worth around $400k together), my retirement account, my house which I live, existing savings account, and just sentimental things. I offered to pay for a lawyer for her, and make anything earned AFTER the wedding fair game in a divorce split. 

In my previous divorce my ex took a lot that I had before we ever even met each other, and took a lot of things with sentimental value just to hurt me. I floated the idea of a prenup and she was not OK with it. It hurt her feelings, and she said I was planning for a divorce if I want a prenup. She had this idea that when we marry everything becomes ours. We've been dating for 4 years, and had very few bumps so I don't see a super high risk of divorce but I do acknowledge it's there. Anyways, I love her, and I said sure. 

Fast forward a couple months, her grandmother abruptly died (wasn't expected. Grandmother was quite healthy before. Had a heart attack). Apparently the grandmother left the entire estate to her; Worth roughly $800k. Now, the tables have turned and she wants a prenup protecting ***these assets from me which I was fine with, but she doesn't want to sign my prenup in return for that.*** Her reasoning is that her grandmother wouldn't have wanted her wealth to ""leave her direct family and that there's a reason it was left all to me and not my siblings or parents"", and that the prenup must not have been important to me because I threw out the idea after minimal pushback... 

I'm at a loss here. In one regard I'm glad we had prenup discussions because it brought out these sides of us, but I'm really wondering if this 4-year relationship that has been full of nothing but love and support for each other until now is even salvageable. She's not willing to budge on her OWN prenup like I was, and I'm finding this whole situation very frustrating."

She struggled through it, with the chemo, radiation and infections, and lately we thought she was about to overcome it. But a few months ago it started spreading again and now the doctors are telling us we need to bring her home. 

There’s nothing else we can do and I’ve never felt pain like this before. I know I need to be strong for her, but I just wanted to know what I can do to make her happy before she passes? Any ideas are appreciated.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and responses, I’ve been trying to read them all and respond to you all. 

We told her today about her situation: she cried a bit but told us that she was tired and she knew her time was coming. She will be given small doses of morphine to keep the pain away, have a hospice nurse and be able to pass away at home. I plan to make sure she’s up for whatever I think we could do,  but unfortunately big trips or doing big things are out of the question. She’s very tired and she seems to want to relax. I also want to say that I am for sure going to be recording audio, videos and taking SO MANY selfies with her before she passes. Some she’ll know about and some she wont. I also plan on asking her to either draw me a tattoo or pick one for me, putting the recording of her saying she loves me and her name too. I’ll let her pick the area, and see what she’d like to do. 

I have taken a leave of absence at my work and will be with her until her time comes. I will also be talking to my family about counseling and counseling for my little sibling as well ( my brother 10). 

I have read so many kind comments and I appreciate all of the support her, I and my family have received. I’m ignoring any negativity and want to be able to be as strong for her as possible.

cq7x8d,I [27M] don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee [27F],7225,0.93,1277,2019-08-14 16:11:20,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cq7x8d/i_27m_dont_feel_sexually_compatible_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cq7x8d/i_27m_dont_feel_sexually_compatible_with_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"*(posted from a throwaway account; I'd rather not have this on my posting history. I previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again I realise I need to get it off my chest.)*

I'm currently engaged to a girl that I absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for March. The start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. Everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: I feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

Just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. I don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about BDSM! Everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. Yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if I'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when I'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. I *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. Pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

Sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. It just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. There are times where I want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where I want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where I may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

Often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - I dont know how they do that!*"". Well to be blunt, I'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do I have the exact same desires as her friends. Other times she may say that I ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. It makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which I really appreciate... but that's it.

Previous chats have been fruitless, so I've tried to communicate in other ways. That's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. Quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. So I've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. I hope this shows that I don't even care for specific fantasies, I just want to play and have fun, *and I recognise that's a two way street.*

She recently embarrassed me (I think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so I didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items I purchased. She made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. Yet as I sat there feeling awkward I just realised that I think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. I just feel stuck.

We *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. She's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. Yet for me, the few turn-ons that I've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

So I'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; I have someone I love and I want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone I don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. The last thing I'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. Yet I'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically I'm not bad looking, but I begin to focus on weight I could lose etc. It also changes my perception of her - I then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *I simply don't feel fulfilled*. I just feel stuck."
i6li7j,My (33m) wife (32f) said her ex’s name while we were having sex,7212,1.0,463,2020-08-09 21:18:00,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6li7j/my_33m_wife_32f_said_her_exs_name_while_we_were/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i6li7j/my_33m_wife_32f_said_her_exs_name_while_we_were/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"TLDR wife says an ex’s name while we’re having sex, now I question what’s going on. Should I be looking into if she’s cheating?

My wife and I have been married for 4 years and we have a 2 year old. We dated on and off for 3 years before getting married. Last night, she says her ex’s name while we are having sex. She gave some weird excuse as to why. She said it’s a common name (it is a very common name) and must of heard it recently?? I wasn’t going to start a big argument with her at that time. It has since gotten me worried about why she did that. 

For some background, this was a guy she was with for a couple years before I met her. They met in college and were serious for some time. They had broken up when I met her and decided they were better as friends. They were friends for years before they dated. We started dating but he remained in the picture. He was her best friend first and foremost and I grudgingly went along with it for her . Several months pass and I put my foot down saying it’s too uncomfortable for me. There was some resistance but she steps back from him. Every time we broke up, she was with him. We finally reconciled and got engaged. He apparently didn’t know this and stops talking to her. She was devastated which should of been a red flag. We talked about it and she was happy to have chosen me. 

Now after this has happened, I’m tempted to see if she’s gotten back in contact with him again. I know she’s checked in on his social media because I saw the searches on the laptop. She doesn’t know I know that. I don’t think she’d cheat but this guy was always different for her. Do I just confront her? Do I start going through her phone? Or am I being paranoid?"
ad0p6n,My (29/F) sister (33/F) got divorced over her refusal to keep working. She's still unemployed and is mad at me for refusing to live with her and support her financially,7211,0.97,899,2019-01-06 06:48:36,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ad0p6n/my_29f_sister_33f_got_divorced_over_her_refusal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ad0p6n/my_29f_sister_33f_got_divorced_over_her_refusal/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"(I'm posting this anonymously because I don't want this on my main reddit account).

My sister (33/F) used to be married. I (29/F) am single and have never been married. A year ago my sister's ex-husband (38/M?) filed for divorce and left her. The reason he divorced her was because she had wanted to quit her job and be a stay at home mom to my nephew, who was 3 at the time. They both worked full-time and they had a housekeeper come once a week and a part-time nanny for their son. My sister didn't want to do any household chores when she was staying home and still wanted to keep the housekeeper and nanny. Without her salary the couldn't afford it and she said her husband could work a second 20 hour a week job on top of the full-time job he already had. She also wanted to spend exactly the same. Her husband wasn't on board with this and he didn't want her to just up and quit her job. She quit once day anyways and only told him after the fact. He filed for divorce.

In the divorce my sister wanted alimony even though the law didn't really call for it in that situation. Since she was able to work and walked out on her job by her choice, the court counted this against her. She was not awarded alimony because of that and because she earned the exact same amount as her ex-husband. The court also awarded them 50/50 shared legal and physical custody of my nephew. The courts preferred method was one week on and one week off but they can do whatever they want as long as the time is split equally. My sister has to have him on mother's day and her ex-husband on father's day and holidays and his birthday are alternated by year. Since the time is equally split and their income and earning was always the same (ie her ex-husband wasn't a lot richer than her) neither of them has to pay child support to the other. The court counted my sister's former job and the fact there was nothing stopping her from working as income that she was making.

They didn't own a home or property and they rented. Her ex-husband kept putting money in the bank account and paying the bills so his son would be okay and so his credit wouldn't be affected. The lease is up on the last day of March and it isn't paid beyond that. My sister has no job and can't afford the apartment so she has to move. Her ex-husband is no longer giving her money since the divorce became final.

My sister hasn't looked for a job. She lost her appeal to the courts ruling for alimony and child support. She wants to live with me and for me to financially to support her.

Our parents are in their 60s and recently sold their house, paid off any debt they had and moved into an apartment for active seniors. It is small but nice. Their siblings and both sets of our grandparents live in similar kind of apartment buildings. Our cousins also live in either apartments or condos and are married with more than one baby/child. They don't have any room for her. Our parents have enough left from their house sale and pensions to afford their rent/bills for the rest of their lives but they are not super rich and can't afford to support my sister.

I am single. I am working towards my PhD and will have it in a few months. I was living with 2 other PhD students who just finished theirs. One got engaged and moved in with her boyfriend. The other got a job offer overseas. I found a small bachelor apartment for myself. My sister is mad that I didn't chose a bigger place so she could move in with me. She also wants me to support her financially once I complete my PhD and start working.

How do I get her and my family off my back. I don't want to live with her. She has a college degree and there is no reason she can't work beyond her being lazy. I am not worried about my nephew because her ex-husband is the best and most devoted father ever and will step in if she isn't looking after him. She said she will find a rich husband but her parenting and divorce settlement says neither of them can introduce any new boyfriend or girlfriend to my nephew or have an overnight visitor if my nephew with them without permission from a judge. How do I get my sister and family (parents, aunts, uncles and cousins) to stop asking me to live with her (even temporarily). My sister was never this much of an idiot before she quit her job. She is fully able to work and I don't want to support her. 

TL;DR My sister's husband divorced her because she quit her job and refused to work. Now my sister wants me to financially support her and my family wants me to live with her at least. How do I get them off my back?

My husband and I have been married for 10 years and have two children together.  
  
He travels often. I also want to say that about 8 months ago I discovered that I was infected with an incurable STD; He blamed me for this, saying that I was the unfaithful one.  
  
Well, I was browsing Facebook in a Mothers group, in that group it is for help with children, to ask for donations, share experiences and memes.  
  
A mother shared that she would give her husband a laxative tea so he wouldn't go to a soccer game the next day. It was all mockery and laughter in the comments of the post and telling her to update the result.  
  
I am a person who likes to read comments, unfortunately I saw a profile that had a photo of a woman with my husband.  
  
I started watching and apparently they got married civilly, my husband created another profile but has a different name and surname. I think that child has his false last name because she uploaded a post when she went to register the child's birth certificate and placed the full name there as if she were proud of it.  
  
I posted it in the same group (now that they give the option to post anonymously), several gave me advice and we deduced that possibly the other lady didn't know because of what she shared on her profile.  
  
I wrote to her and was surprised that the b\*tch did know that he was married. They have been married for 2 years and their baby is approximately 14 months old. Although they are not technically married, their marriage is not valid.  
  
I hired a lawyer, I took all the evidence and I am in the divorce process, since when I complained he preferred her, he left the house to live with her. Besides, he refuses to give alimony, claiming that he has another child to support, and that if he has to give alimony to my children, he will seek the minimum payment even if he has to quit his job.  
  
How do I proceed with my life? I think I feel very limited in rebuilding my life because of the STD and my children.

So Friday after my post here I stayed with my older sister and her husband. When I arrived my sister launched into protective mode and kept pushing to know what had driven me to breakdown so I said “dating stuff”. She automatically assumed I meant a girl, and I didn’t have the balls to correct her. I’ve only just realised I’m bi and coming out is something I will have to build up to.


As part of her ‘relationship therapy’, she confiscated my phone, gave me ridiculous amounts of ice cream, and we just chilled watching movies like we did when we were kids. Apparently it’s what she always does when one of her friends has guy trouble so I just went along with it and it was the most relaxed I’ve felt all week despite feeling guilty for not telling my housemate I wasn’t coming back that night. 


When my sister finally went to bed, I caved and stole my phone back and everything hit me again and I felt overwhelmingly sick and disappointed with myself. Bear in mind that my housemate isn’t one for texting much or calling if he can avoid it. Even in our three months of bliss he only ever text me in response or about what food he wanted me to grab. But there were 6 texts and 8 missed calls this time. It was the first time he’d ever chased me and I hadn’t responded to his original ‘Hold out until Sunday’ earlier, which was odd for me because I usually never ignore him. The first five were all questioning if I'm okay and check I'm coming home but the final one hit me hard.


[Housemate - 01:12] Just tell me if you’re safe pls


After sending him a text that confirmed I’m safe he phoned me within a minute which is honestly record breaking for him and my heart leapt straight into my throat. He genuinely sounded cut up as he launched into a thousand and one questions. After being practically invisible for the past week, I didn’t expect him to react like that. In some ways, I kind of thought he wouldn’t notice me not being there and I was waiting to be proved right.


Anyway, once I could actually speak between his questions, I told him I wouldn’t be coming home until the ex was gone, to which he confirmed ex was leaving Sunday whether or not he wanted to. There were a few moments of awkward silence and then I asked figuring it was better to know what I would come home to or if for my wellbeing I needed to look for a new place to live away from him.


Me: “Was I just a fling or did I actually mean something to you?” 


Him: “...” 


Me: “Fine. Forget I asked. Just let me know when he’s gone and-“


Him: “You don’t like guys. Not like that. That’s what you said.” 


And yeah. I did say that after our first kiss back in April but the topic never came up again and with how things were going, it didn’t feel like it needed to because I thought it was obvious after all the stuff we’ve been doing together. 


I’ve honestly never facepalmed so hard in my life. All this time he’d been sleeping with me under the belief I was just with him because I didn’t have a girlfriend around to get off with and that I’d leave as soon as one showed up. I’ve literally been treating him like I would any of my previous partners (cooking for him, picking him up from work because he doesn’t drive and I didn’t want him unnecessarily using public transport during a pandemic, hugging and kissing him outside of sex) and the only difference was that I haven’t made it ‘official’ in public because I didn’t think we were a thing to be made public. That and I was kind of slow realising how important he is to me. 


We chatted a bit, and I apologised for making him worry and he told me how it’s been hell putting up with ex today without me around for ‘moral support’. Turns out he finds ex more intimidating than I do and when ex showed up last Saturday, it was like his headspace went straight back to when he was trapped in that relationship. He admitted he didn’t handle it well but the reason he stopped all contact with me was so that we seemed like we used to before they broke up because he didn’t want ex discovering I was the one he’d heard about on the grapevine that my housemate had moved on with (which means he’s been telling people about me when I’ve not told anyone about him!) all intending to stop ex directing his less than acceptable behaviour towards me.


At this point, it clicked in my head that their dynamic had never been a healthy one, centred around ex controlling my housemate and the fear was crippling him now he was exposed to that situation again. The problem was that he hid it so damn well that I never noticed. I wish he'd just put it in a text. 


I offered to come home, but it was nearly 3am and my housemate was insistent I wait until morning as I was a good fifteen miles away. (He was in a car accident 2 years ago at night which is why he no longer drives)


Anyway, somehow we arrived at a conversation about how we initially hooked up. I admitted that after watching porn with him I was just generally curious about what it would feel like to be with a guy, but I didn’t expect to like it and I wasn’t bothered back then if I never found out. I also found it a turn on that he's taller than me which I’ve always kind of had a thing for but I’ve always been the taller one. 


Then he admitted that he’d always found me attractive but accepted it was impossible which was why he used to limit how often we hung out because while we always got along, crushing on his straight friend was killing him. But when we watched porn together in April he was determined not to waste his only chance and did anything sexually to keep me beside him for as long as possible but it was always in his mind that I wouldn’t date him at the end of it. 


I replied with “well guess it’s a good thing it turns out I’m bi then, huh?” and then we both turned into two idiots realising what this meant for us both. Some tears spilled.


Then yesterday morning I got home at about 8 am after only about an hour or so of sleep and took too much delight in ‘relocating’ ex’s belongings to the driveway and telling him where to go. (Normally I never have that level of confidence, but I finally realised my housemate needed someone to be the braver one when it came to his ex). The git keyed the side of my car before leaving but jokes on him as it’s way overdue scrapping and it barely passed it’s last MOT so now I’ve got another reason to go car searching.


Also tonight will be the first time I pick my boyfriend up and I've baked him an oreo cake while he was at work as I know it’s his favourite, so he’s got a surprise waiting for him when he gets home. I never want him to feel around me what he did with his ex. 


TL;DR: We were idiots who missed so many signs, and now we’re boyfriends. 

And now I say goodbye and head out to pick him up. Thanks Reddit!



EDIT: I don't know where to start! This really wasn't the response I expected to us both being idiots around each other. Thank you so much everyone! There's way too many comments for me to reply to individually but I've read every one. 

Thank you for all the encouraging and supportive messages! I'm so glad my ridiculous life has cheered so many of you up. It's a great feeling knowing that more than just me and my boyfriend benefitted from this weekend.

As for people who say this reads like a story, I'm not surprised as I work in theatre and writing/performing is what I'm professionally used to. Although you have given me the idea to adapt this experience into a peice for the future, so thanks I guess? Cue mortified boyfriend at the first showing.

I haven't really got any closing words but I just want to tell everyone that life can be amazing some times and hit you right in the face. I have so much optimism for the future but I'm also honestly scared. I don't want to keep him a secret, but we've agreed when I come out it should be in person so we're going to see how we go and the next time my family have a get together after all the restrictions ease further I'm going to bring him with me and introduce him. 

Thanks everyone!"
iiwkf7,My mom is accusing my husband of abusing our daughter because he was abused as a child,7096,0.99,336,2020-08-29 23:06:57,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iiwkf7/my_mom_is_accusing_my_husband_of_abusing_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iiwkf7/my_mom_is_accusing_my_husband_of_abusing_our/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I (F, 32) have been married to my husband (M,33) for 7 years and I've known him longer than that. My mother (60) watches our toddler daughter a few days a week while we work. Sometimes my husband's schedule lines up so that he can watch her.  My mother has always had a problem with this.  

It started when my husband opened up to my mom about the sexual abuse he suffered as a child by a family member. I think he told her this because my mom's side of the family was going though something similar and he was trying to empathize. They used to be really close, even though my mom is super conservative and my husband has tattoos and piercings and she was really skeptical of him when we first got together for these reasons.  

Mom believes that his prior abuse makes him a pedophile. She says that she has read that children that were abused go on to abuse their own children.  It started when our daughter was born with backhanded comments and assumptions and came to a head when she showed up at our home when i wasn't there and accused my husband of abusing our daughter because she said that her privates hurt.  That was yesterday. I talked to my daughter alone and asked her why she hurt and she pointed to her lower stomach and said her privates hurt and she needed to poop. She's 3, sometimes she confuses names of body parts.  

I don't know what to say to my mom,  I know I have to say something. I don't know how I'm going to take my daughter back to her home to be watched by her.  I have no reason to suspect abuse and never have. I used to be a mandated reporter, I know the signs to look for. My husband is a wonderful father. He has gone to counseling to reconcile his past and I think that he's come a really long way with the trauma. We have raised our daughter in the most loving and trusting way we can, and have taught her about anatomy and boundaries. My husband insisted on this, because the thought of his baby going through what he went through is unthinkable.  

My husband is obviously so hurt and furious at the actions of my mother. I think it's really unfair of her to assume he is dangerous just because he was abused. I'm also insulted that she thinks I would allow my daughter to be in a situation like that.  

How do I handle this?"

Most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

So I came home the next day after staying the night else where. She didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. I went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. She came in and asked what I was doing and I told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that I would be sleeping in here. She rolled her eyes and said that she thought I had got over and asked why I even bothered to come home if I was going to act like this. I told her because it is my home and I'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. She stormed off and that was that for that day. 

The next day she I came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  She asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. I told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. The look of rage on her face when I said that last part was something I don't think I've ever seen before. I hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. She told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. We didn't talk the rest of that day.

The next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. Someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. They said we need to talk so I invited them in we sat down. They said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends. They apologized to me for keeping it a secret and said that they agree with counseling and they would be happy to pay for it but changing his name is going to far. I told them thank you and that I haven't made that decision with out a lot of consideration. I told them that you really don't know what you would do till you're in this situation. After a little more talking they left and asked me not to tell my wife they stopped by. I agreed. Shortly after they left I called around and found a counciler and made appointment that worked with both our work schedules. 

When my wife came her I told her about the appointment and she just walked off not saying a word. Our appointment is Thursday and I'm still sleeping in the guest room. That's what's been going on so far. Thank you guys and I'll try to update you again when I can.

Edit. I just want say I'm not just going to up and change the name. It's something I'm considering. I want to talk to the counciler first to see what impact it might have if any and how to go about it if there are none"

**Note - Please don't make a comment that is hateful and derogatory towards my wife. My post last time was locked because of this and I wasn't able to respond. I'm posting this at work, and I only have a few pockets of time throughout the day where I can respond.**

By the time I was able to respond to my first post, it became locked. I read everyone's replies and thank you to those who responded with good advice. I got a lot of DM's and I wasn't able to respond to everyone, but I did read your messages. However, I did not appreciate the many comments that simply insulted my wife, I know she fucked up and I'm still very angry at her, but I want to believe she can heal and become a better a person. 

Also, some of the DM's I got were extremely weird & hateful towards women in general, like stuff you see on the incel tears sub - y'all need more help than me and my wife. 

There were some common questions I wanted to address to provide additional clarification. 

* How did she avoid jail? 

I only mentioned the civil case since I felt it was the most appropriate to write about because I was originally angry about our financial situation. There was also a criminal case. Our lawyer thought she would originally have to go to jail for 3 months. However, we were able to get her punishment to be community service instead. She has A LOT of community service hours to fill within a year, she will also be getting visits from a PO. Laura and her husband did file restraining orders against her, I honestly can't blame them for that. It helped my wife that she had a clean record and has family that works in law enforcement. I want her to finish those community service hours first before we talk about her working more hours to help pay me back. 

* Why did she do this to Laura?

That is a good question. I asked her this multiple times over the past several months to try to understand what this woman did to my wife. She would tell me that Laura deserved everything horrible thing that my wife did to her, that Laura was a shitty person, a narcissist, a liar, and just overall a scumbag. But she never really gave specific examples. I've been pressing her for more info, and when she told me some specifics it made me feel sick to my stomach, not because of what Laura did but because how far my wife decided to go due to some petty things that happened in their friendship. Their friendship ended about 8-9 (they had been friends since early in high school) years ago and it was over a man they had both briefly dated. My wife dated ""Matt"" for a few months, she broke up with him because she thought that Matt had feelings for Laura. Laura said she didn't want to date Matt because he had dated my wife. My wife decided to ""test"" her friend Laura's loyalty, and told Laura she had her blessing to date Matt. Laura and Matt ended up dating for a few months, my wife stuck around while they were dating and once they broke up my wife told Laura that she had failed a loyalty test. They fought, and ultimately it was Laura who decided to end the friendship. (Note: In case it's not clear, Laura's current husband is NOT Matt.) 

Secondly, I was able to get some information from her about what inspired her to do this since their friendship had ended so long ago. My wife said she happened to see (by chance, not by stalking) Laura at a restaurant about ~1.5-2 years ago, and it looked like Laura had lost a lot of weight and was fit. My wife and I are both fairly overweight, and apparently Laura use to be overweight too. My wife admitted that she felt angry that Laura had lost a lot of weight while she had never been able to. My wife was also insulting Laura and said that she doesn't make a pretty thin person and that her new muscular body was too masculine. She also insulted Laura's husband's looks and physique as well. I saw both Laura and her husband in person on multiple occasions - they both look like normal, attractive people who obviously work out. (I could also tell my wife was irritated when she saw Laura at the courthouse the first time, and you could barely tell that Laura had even had baby.) My wife admitted that she just wanted to do some snooping to try to find that Laura wasn't doing well in life, she found the opposite and was jealous of Laura's success. She first found out both of their job titles (they both work at tech companies with some sort of engineering title) and their estimated salaries by using something called Glassdoor, and if that's accurate, then both Laura and her husband make really good money. She also saw a photo on facebook of Laura and her husband standing in front of what appeared to be their very beautiful and large home. She said she was angry because she knew that Laura wasn't deserving of any of this. She proceeded to insult Laura about how she's not that smart, not pretty, not responsible, she claimed that all Laura did through college was do drugs, drink, have sex with anything that had a penis, skip class and failed a lot, my wife said that she's the type who would cheat on her husband, that she's manipulative and is always up to something, etc. 

Both Laura and her husband seemed very sad and exhausted throughout the whole ordeal. I never picked up on anything sinister from Laura at all, I felt absolutely awful for her. I felt extreme shame and embarrassment whenever I was in the same room with Laura and her husband. I don't think I was ever able to make direct eye contact with either of them.  

So..yeah. I was expecting Laura to have done something truly evil or sinister in the past and that just wasn't the case. 

* Does she feel remorseful?

I want to say yes, she does. She has been really depressed since this all finalized. However, I can't help but think she's sad only because she got caught. She hasn't directly said anything that would lead me to believe she is truly remorseful. 

She's still angry at Laura for escalating to the point of a criminal and civil case, she feels that Laura overreacted. My wife believes every horrible thing she said about Laura. She's convinced that Laura is some kind of alcoholic/drug addict who cheats on her husband, and is the type to lie and cheat her way to the top of her career. And somehow Laura is able to hide this from everyone in her life. My wife felt like she was trying to ""expose"" Laura for the monster that she is. She feels that Laura pressing charges and suing her is additional proof that Laura is vindictive. 

My hope is that she has time to think while she is doing her community service hours over the next year. I think she feels bad that I had to empty out our accounts and sell some things to come up with the money. I talked to her about working more hours once she has finished community service, and she agreed. 

* Are you going to get divorced?

The thought has crossed my mind, but we've been together for so long and I still love her despite this disgusting thing she has done. I can't see my life without her. But, I know (and I'm having a hard time admitting this to myself) that if she doesn't improve or learn a lesson from this mess then I can't be with her anymore. A lot of people mentioned that if she can do this type of thing to an ex-friend, then she can do the same to an ex-husband. This has me worried some, I'd like to believe she wouldn't go nuclear on me if we did file for divorce. I'll be taking precautions in case I have to defend myself in the future. 


* Why is she only working part-time? 

She is a licensed masseuse and works at a really nice salon/spa. Her hourly wage is pretty high, but she hasn't been able to get the hours she wants at the spa she works at. She could probably get a more full time position at a different spa but with a slightly lower hourly wage, which would still bring in more income than what she is doing now. She really likes the place she is at and doesn't want to leave, but I may pressure her to full time work elsewhere to help pay me back and refill our emergency fund once she is done with community service. At the moment she is onboard with helping me put money back into our savings accounts. 

* What about therapy? 

I know we need this, both as a couple and as individuals to deal with this mess. I talked to her about this and she doesn't seem totally sold on the idea of therapy. I've expressed that I think it would help both us, and she seems indifferent at this point. I've talked to her parents, who are really angry/disappointed in her, they basically begged me not to leave her over this. I told her parents that I think therapy would help both of us, but I can't afford it now. They offered to pay for couples therapy, but that is as much as they would be able to afford, so it's a start. I know my wife will need individual therapy, and if that means I stop going to couples therapy so she can get the 1 on 1 help she needs, so be it. 


I'm not ready to call my wife a psychopath as many of the commenters did the last post. I think she got carried away, and thought she was trying to expose someone she truly believed was a bad person. I'm heavily leaning towards that she has had some sort of mental breakdown and focused all of her energy on this one woman and her life. I'm not going to give up on my wife yet. It's very possible that she has some underlying mental illness that could very well be treated with therapy or meds. 

* How much money was she sued for?

I don't want to give specific numbers, but it will take about 4-5 years to get back to where we were prior to this happening. If my wife takes on a full time after she is done with community service and hands over the majority of her paycheck, it may take less than 4 years.  

* Are kids involved?

No, we don't have kids and are not planning on having any. 


* What next? 

That's what I need help with. I've sat down with my wife a few times since the post and I can feel some resistance coming from her about starting couple therapy. I think she's irritated at her parents for offering to pay for therapy for us. She has stated that she would rather us solve our problems together without interference from someone she doesn't know. She's afraid she isn't going to like any therapist we find, and that the therapist will attack her throughout our sessions. I've tried explaining to her that the therapist isn't there to blame anyone, that they would try to help us and that it would be a safe space for her to talk and vent about whatever she needs. I've brought up the idea of therapy every night since the post, and each time she has had an excuse along the lines of - it won't help, the therapist will gang up on her, she isn't going to like the therapist/the therapist won't like her, or that we can solve our own problems at home. 

tl;dr : I answered a bunch of questions I wasn't able to get to before my first post was locked. But, I really need help pushing my wife to get therapy, she is resistant and isn't convinced it will help us."

I made dinner and put  Frozen on  to get her to sit with me on the couch. It was so awkward. She still wouldn't look at me.

I finally got her to open up. I apologized to her for having seen what she saw. I asked her what she thinks she saw...... all she asked was why was BF hurting me?. I explained that BF and I were just wrestling and I was upset that I lost. Then she goes to ask why was I screaming then? (I was wishing lightening would strike me). I told her that I was mad cause I was losing. She bought it.. THANK GOD. Poor thing got freaked out because she thought BF was hurting me. I texted him and asked him to call me and apologize to me for 'hurting' me. He did and I put on speaker phone and he apologized. She felt so much better after that. She was back to her self again after that. We finished the movie and I gave her cough syrup and put her to bed. Disaster avoided!

I did call and tell my parents. They were shocked. I haven't come out to them yet and they were unaware that my 'friend' was  actually my BF that I've been seeing for a year. As for the sex part.... before they could yell, I apologized  and promised them it won't happen again. AND I reminded them of the time I came home from school when I was 16 and caught them in the act on the kitchen island.  That got me out of trouble. I wasn't grounded or noting. They did ask if they could meet him sometime next week (he also wants to apologize to them).

Today was a good day. Saved my sister's childhood, came out to my parents, had sex- got caught and didn't get in trouble , and parents want to meet my BF.

Lesson learned. If I want to be intimate with him again, I'll go to his apartment.

bsyso8,My boyfriend “slut shames” me because of my post partum body,7036,0.93,959,2019-05-26 01:25:14,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsyso8/my_boyfriend_slut_shames_me_because_of_my_post/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsyso8/my_boyfriend_slut_shames_me_because_of_my_post/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Some background: I used to be very small chested and thin. I also used to wear a lot of dresses and he loved this. Last August we had our son, so my body still looked like I was 5 months pregnant until about September when it was sweater weather, so I missed out on my wearing any of the dresses I really liked and he never saw my “new body”.

Since being pregnant, my chest went from a size B to a DD. My body is just generally fuller and I’ve been feeling self conscious about it for awhile, but he has been encouraging until now. 

On Mother’s Day he bought me a really pretty floral dress. The chest area has a dip that is not over the top, but it does show the tops of my newly bigger boobs. I tried it on and he immediately acted off and told me it would just be an “around the house” dress. He has never shamed me before so I figured he thought I didn’t like it, so we met up for lunch later and I wore it to show him I did. He blew up telling me how provocative I looked and that I was trying to look “sexy” in all the photos with our son and how disgusted he would feel when he looked back at them.
We walked back home and he continued this, every time I walked past a guy he would tell me they must be thinking about how easy I was. He told me that we were going to have to go through my closet and throw away any dresses that make me look like a prostitute. 

I got upset with him and told him I was not dressing to look like a whore and that he needed to accept my body wasn’t going to look the same as before, and I couldn’t just tuck my boobs away especially in summer heat. He got annoyed and asked if I was actually getting mad over it and we didn’t talk for a few hours.

His apology was, “I’m not saying this to make you feel bad, but, C’MON.”

I don’t know what to do as he has NEVER been like this before. I feel so ashamed and humiliated and I’m trying to pretend I am not embarrassed but he has really hurt me but can’t see it. 
Any advice on what to say or if anyone else has been in a similar situation would be great.,"
hoqmbx,My (23F) BF (25M) keeps asking me to shave my pubic hair and I'm losing my mind,7027,0.99,495,2020-07-10 20:39:58,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoqmbx/my_23f_bf_25m_keeps_asking_me_to_shave_my_pubic/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoqmbx/my_23f_bf_25m_keeps_asking_me_to_shave_my_pubic/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I've been dating my BF Alex for about a year. Now for some background, I am completely okay with people having preferences around their/their partner's pubic hair situation. But I have made it a point since I was 20 to tell my partners pretty soon into us hanging out that I do not shave or wax my pubes.  I used to do it all the time when I was a teenager and it left me with a bunch of ingrown hairs, rashes, and pain. I realized I was solely doing it for the other person and I preferred some hair on myself. I do trim though. I tell a potential partner/hook-up as soon as sex comes up that if they're not okay with dating someone with pubic hair, I respect that but we're just not compatible.

When Alex and I started talking about sex I told him the exact same thing. He told me there was no issue and he didn't care one way or another. I thought ""great!"" and we began dating with no issues. He's the coolest dude I've ever met and I was seriously considering moving in together around 6 months into us dating.

That is...until around 3 months ago. He randomly brought up that he was talking with some friends about ""manscaping"" (I also prefer hair on my partners so I have never asked them to shave or even trim, Alex trims his pubes a little but no shaving) and they were saying how they were ""lucky"" all the girls they had hooked up with were cleanly waxed/shaved because pubic hair on women looked ""gross"". He said he didn't agree with them that it was gross for women to have pubes but that it was weird he was the only guy with a GF that did not shave/wax so he asked me if I would oblige the request. I told him that I was serious early on about not shaving my pubes and he had agreed to being okay with that and told him I wouldn't shave. I thought that was the end of the convo...but NOPE. He's been bringing it up around every other week. Every single time I have told him firmly that I will not shave or wax and he has still continued to bring it up. I've asked him why the sudden interest in me being shaved and he says he just thinks it's weird that I don't shave ""when so many other girls do.""

I'm at a point where I'm just sick of this and am seriously considering breaking up but most of my friends think I am being unreasonable and should find another solution. What do you guys think?

Edit: He showed me the convo in question and he never mentioned my pubic hair to his friends, only that he agreed the bald look is better on women. As far as I know he doesn’t discuss me in that manner to them."
9qot5g,My boyfriend wants to break up after college - i don't but also don't see the point in continuing the relationship until we leave college,7027,0.94,769,2018-10-23 18:39:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9qot5g/my_boyfriend_wants_to_break_up_after_college_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9qot5g/my_boyfriend_wants_to_break_up_after_college_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,,False,"So my bf and I have been in a relationship for 2 years now and I love him like no one else before and I feel like he might be the one. 

In those 2 years we had ups and downs like in any relationship but to sum it up we always worked it out somehow and grew together more and more. 

Fast forward to yesterday: we had been talking about what we wished for our future and at some point he just went ""I think we should break up when we leave college"". 
I was shocked because in every other conversation he seemed like he wanted to continue our relationship. 

The problem is: I really don't want to break up with him. 
I love him so much and I don't see the point in being in a relationship with someone who wants to break up anyway. 


Am I at fault or does anyone else feel like it would be a waste of time? 
Advice?

Things are not better yet. In fact, things have gotten deeply disturbing. I tried to write this up without using names, and it got confusing, so let's call my non-biological daughter Jane. My other three kids are John (21) Jill (17) and Jenny (15)

John, Jill, and Jenny went out and got DNA tested behind my back. The other 3 kids are all biologically mine. They made a big show of giving the results at a family dinner that was supposed to help us all bond again as a family after the original issue, and it upset my daughter a lot. She felt rejected, and honestly, I felt insulted that they hadn't respected my wishes and let sleeping dogs lie at least until things were more stable. 

I started my absolute best to make Jane feel more safe once she came home. I started sleeping on the couch in her room so she could talk to me if she ever woke up feeling like she had to. I've been taking her and her siblings out a lot more than I used to. I got her presents, and tried to be there for her. I even did something I haven't done since high school, and broke out my old guitar and wrote her a song. I don't know why I thought that was a good idea. I guess I thought she'd be able to understand I wasn't full of it. 

My soon-to-be ex wife decided to use all of this to accuse me of being creepy to Jane, saying now that I know we're not related I'm praying on her. She said this in front of Jane. It caused Jane to have a second mental breakdown, and it caused me to call a lawyer and start planning for divorce. This is, in my opinion, a far more unforgivable offense than the cheating. She's my *daughter.* I'm going to fight like hell for as much custody of Jill and Jenny as possible, and the good news is, they both seem to want to live with me, and they're old enough that it matters. 

Those comments, however, made getting through to Jane extremely difficult. I'm worried she'll attempt every day, and she doesn't want me sleeping in her room anymore. I hate my wife with every bone in my body for causing this mess. I can't tell my daughter I love her anymore without scaring her, and she was already scared our relationship was going to change. She says she believes me when I tell her I would never in a million years see her as anything but my *child,* but she flinches when I hug her. How the fuck do I fix this? 

TL;DR: My ex wife made some truly vile comments and now my daughter who I've raised since the day she was born is afraid of me. "
e7x2md,My daughter [1f] got injured in my [32f] care. My husband [38m] called me names and shouted at me. I feel terrible about everything.,7006,0.92,1054,2019-12-08 23:39:50,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e7x2md/my_daughter_1f_got_injured_in_my_32f_care_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e7x2md/my_daughter_1f_got_injured_in_my_32f_care_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I had a daughter a little over a year ago. I was on maternity leave for 9 months and looked after her every day. I now have gone back to work 4 days a week with one day off. My husband works full time. 

At her age, everything is interesting to her. She loves climbing on things and gets herself in all sorts of predicaments. Today was my day off and I’d spent the day with her as usual. 

Well I suddenly decided after her nap to change the cat litter. Obviously daughter being so small means I can’t just leave the room for 10 minutes and do it, so I brought the tray in and kept my eye on her as I emptied and cleaned it. While I was doing this she’d made her way on to the sofa and was peering over the back, taking great interest in my plight.

What happened next was a blur, I walked out of the room to put the litter tray in it’s normal place and in that few seconds she’d made her way back into the sofa, climbed onto the back and promptly fallen face first off the back. I rush to her, cuddle her and she’s screaming. I rock her, and she gradually stops crying and just sort of toddles off to play with her toys. 
 
Now, in the UK we have 2 options when it comes to needing medical help, you can either call 999, which I assume is similar to 911, but there’s also 111. 111 is for those moments where you don’t think anyone is about to die but you could do with a medical professional confirming that. They ask you a lot of questions and will either give you advice, get a paramedic or GP to call you back, or if you’ve really underestimated the situation will send you an ambulance. 

In this situation I called 111, because after the initial crying my daughter basically went back to normal but I wanted to see what they said to look out for in case there was any chance of concussion. They told me a GP would call me back within 10 minutes. 

I quickly call my husband who had just started on his way back from work to tell him what had happened, I was in tears and he asked whether I’d called 999. I said no, but I’m waiting for a call back from a GP. He lost his mind, telling me to call 999 immediately and why the fuck wouldn’t I do that. I attempted to explain that I think she’s fine and that it won’t be necessary to call them. He started swearing at me telling me this was my fault and I was under reacting to the situation and that if I didn’t call 999 he would and hung up. GP then calls me back, asks a lot of questions, tells me to shine a light in her eyes to check her pupils, has she been sick, is the there a bump or an inverted bump on her head, is she showing interest in her toys, responding to her name normally etc. Satisfied the doctor basically said to monitor her for the next couple of hours but most likely she’ll have a nice bump on her head for a couple of days and she’ll be ok and reassured me that that these things happen. 

Husband calls again asking if I’ve called 999. I tell him no, but I’ve spoken to the GP. Starts swearing again and tells me to fucking call for an ambulance. So I do. The operator asks me all the screening questions again and I’m afraid I had to answer honestly. “Does your daughter seem to be in pain” “no” “did she pass out or go quiet after she fell?” “No” “can she lift her head?” “Yes” “can you keep her in the position where she fell to make sure she doesn’t hurt herself further?” “Er, no she got up and toddled off to her toys” “Oh.” and the operator basically said they weren’t going to send an ambulance.

By that point husband has just come in the door. I relay to him what the 999 operator said and he starts calling me a terrible mother, an embarrassment, telling me I don’t care about our daughter, what the fuck was I thinking leaving her alone and called me “mother of the fucking year” and all sorts of other names. He wouldn’t let me explain because he didn’t “care how it happened, just that it fucking happened when she was meant to be in your fucking care” 

Nothing like this has happened before. There is no history of her ever being injured when with me. I don’t know if this is bad but I sometimes have to run and pee and leave her alone in the sitting room for like 10 seconds but really that’s the most she’s ever out of my sight for. He said that that is taking an unnecessary risk and that if he was looking after her he would never even leave the room. Obviously I don’t know if that’s true or not because I’m the only one who ever looks after her on my own. 

But yeah, he totally lost it, told me I’d obviously been sat on my fat arse all day so why the fuck did I suddenly want to change the cat litter? He shouted he was fucking appalled at me and should be fucking ashamed of myself as a parent. Basically it just went on and on.

He apologised later and said he was stressed and I accepted the apology straightaway because I couldn’t stomach the argument going any further, but the whole thing has left me feeling terrible. I can’t shake the feeling of being an inadequate lazy mother who put myself above my child’s safety. 

I guess the advice I want is regarding my husband. Did he treat me unfairly? Was his behaviour wrong? I know I was in the wrong but he’s never shouted and sworn at me like that and being repeatedly called an awful mother has really shaken me I guess.

Edit: The most amazing thing so fair is that none of you have said I’m a shit mum. Honestly, that in itself has really made me feel better. Some of you have said I should divorce my husband from this. It’s not great
I grant you, but honestly he’s never reacted like this before and we’ve been together years so I’m not going to divorce him over this one thing. Particularly as he did apologise the same evening.

Edit 2: I’ve been told this information is relevant and I don’t disagree: Interestingly, one of his colleagues wive’s recently left their 2 year old on their own in the bath for about 30 seconds while she went to get something and the child drowned and the mother has now been arrested and their lives are pretty much ruined. It’s awful. I think it’s been playing on his mind because he’s asked me a couple of times to never leave her alone in the bath (I never would, I don’t even take my phone into the bathroom - she has my full attention) so I wonder whether that had something to do with his reaction."

So basically, when I wrote the last post I knew her boyfriend was a dick and had some views he needed to change. I never really thought about how abusive it was though, or the extent to how bad it was. I sent her the post and told her to send it to him. He said it was ‘bias’ and wouldn’t explain how. Said we were plotting against him. He has reddit; I welcomed him to post a reply and explain his side and how it was bias but he never did. There obviously isn’t an explanation for it. 

They had a huge fight over it where he called her childish and said he didn’t want to be with her anymore (surprise, suddenly when she’s calling him out on his shit he wants to end things). She told him she wanted couples counselling and that she wanted to try and work on it because she’s dumb and in love. They decided to try and were okay for about two days until the next fight. He basically flipped the whole thing around on how she’s childish and he doesn’t want to be with someone so childish and he doesn’t want to raise kids with someone so childish and he actually said he felt like he’d have to do all the work. He ended up breaking up with her, packing his stuff and leaving. 

We talked and I heard a lot more about how abusive he really was and I am so glad he broke up with her because I don’t think she ever would have left him. I’m not a doctor and can’t diagnose anything but based on a few internet searches he seems like a huge narcissist. 

She’s heartbroken, but you know, sometimes the trash really does take itself out."
b10lwz,I (20m) was introduced to this girl (20f) and she is incredibly intimidating.,7006,0.92,902,2019-03-14 19:24:03,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b10lwz/i_20m_was_introduced_to_this_girl_20f_and_she_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b10lwz/i_20m_was_introduced_to_this_girl_20f_and_she_is/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I’m not sure what to do. This girl is a great and stable (first for me) and attractive and smart human being. I really like her and the friend who introduced us said the second I left her sight, she texted my friend about how hot I am which is a good sign. 

The thing is, I used to be able to draw back in like, 11th grade. She paints full canvases. I listen to music (but like really hard rock) sometimes I guess. She writes music, sings, and plays the piano. She’s an accounting major when I’m in graphic design but only just started so all I can really show her is a super low effort picture I took so I could keep up with the class. 

This girl is incredibly intimidating to me. She knows all these “show-off-able” skills and tricks and they’re really really cool and the best thing I can do is make fun of the shot-types used in Taken 3 and play video games. I have no idea how I can compare much less impress this girl and keep her interested. 

Note: we haven’t even hung out 1 on 1 but there’s obvious chemistry. Not enough to obscure the worries behind this post but we can hold an engaging conversation (neither of us have really talked about ourselves yet so idk if that even counts.)

Note 2, Electric Boogaloo: We’ve only hung out like, twice and it was always cut short. I know I’m overreacting. I just have no idea what to do about this.

Note 3 Return of the OP: okay so I’m going to clarify some stuff to get rid of some negative comments. By impress I mean more of keeping up with her than romantic comedy “impress” garbage and by show off I don’t mean to show off I mean they’re like party tricks or stuff you can physically show off to people or have proof you can do like a painting. I’ve got none if that.

Also thank you so much for the silver. This has never happened to me before.

I really appreciate everyone asking if I’m safe, and I am. 

I wish I could give clear answers but I can’t. 

Things escalated when I tried to speak to him, keeping some of y’all’s advice in mind. I sat him down and explained to him that I’d love to have kids with him in the future but that I’m not pregnant right now, and that his insistence worries & scares me. 

I told him we could go to the doctor together if that would put his mind at ease, or I could take another test in front of him. (I was just hoping to snap him out of it somehow.)

He got very agitated, said many hurtful things & accused me of being a liar many times. That I’m trying to keep our baby away from him, and so on. Nothing made sense & I wasn’t feeling safe anymore. I knew my husband would never harm me in any way, but that wasn’t my husband. 

Things got worse, he did hurt me but nothing permanent or even emergency care-worthy. I also know that if he was in his right mind, he never would’ve done anything like this. 

I called mine & his parents and I’m now staying with my mom. He did seem to calm down a bit when his parents arrived. 

I haven’t seen/spoken to him since then. His mother - she’s an angel - is keeping me posted about everything. We all agree something is very off about him, and we don’t know what it is. But he hasn’t agreed to getting himself checked out in any way. I don’t know how they’ll go about it, but they say - and I painfully have to agree - that it’s best to keep my distance for a bit, as most of it is aimed at me. 

I’m safe, so is he. I miss him so much & just want an answer as to why he’s being like this. I keep trying to figure out if there were signs before, or what I did wrong. 

Thank you all for the replies, they were a great help. It’s so kind you cared to ask if I’m safe. "

My friend ""Sarah"" is on her 3rd marriage at 29. She's got an alcohol problem and gets herself into stupid situations and has cheated on all her partners since I've known her. Her current husband is a great guy, but kind of naive. He really has no clue - he just loves her so much. A couple weeks ago he stopped by my work, and after some small talk he straight up asked me if I had seen or heard of Sarah seeing other men. I told him I honestly didn't know, because I don't \*know\* 100%. He seemed really beat. It was awful. Fast forward to this past weekend, few of our friends got together, and she started to tell us about some dude she met. I was a little buzzed, so I decided to try to sneak her on video. I clicked on my contacts and sent him a video call and he actually picked up. I pretended to be into my phone and just let it roll. He ended the call abut 2 mins in but it was enough to hear what she was talking about. The next day I felt sick at myself for what I did, but my husband thinks he needed to find out, and deep down I do too. I have no idea what's going on or if Sarah's husband even confronted her. Am I the worst person ever?

&#x200B;

Edit: I also previously knew the husband from middle school band! So I was the probably his first choice in confiding/asking.  ""Sarah"" is the one problem child of our group. She has 5 kids (NONE OF THEM HIS BTW), so she rarely goes out and is more on the periph. Also, she was a guest at my wedding and stole the microphone to sing - and that was like 10 years ago.  I care about her as a human, but Sarah is probably the one toxic person I need out of my life. This'll probably do it."

I finally got enough courage to post my story.

I (30HL) have been married to my wife (29LL) for five years, together for seven. As was the case, in the beginning everything was great. I noticed things heading to a DB about 4 years ago. Started out multiple times a week, then dropping to a few times a month. It has now been about 4 months since we last had sex. The last year before that was just duty sex only to have a baby.

We have had the 'talk' many times. Each time she tells me that she's sorry that she's a terrible wife. She says she will try harder, but eventually we end up back where we were. I've tried doing all the chores. Cooking, washing her clothes for work, long massages, date nights, doing things she likes. Basically just trying to help her relax after work (She is a school teacher and works 7 days a week 16 hours a day, weekends are half days.) I know she's tired, but that never stopped her before. I figured if she had more free time and was relaxed she would want to spend time with me. I gave her space and never pestered her about sex and the gap just grew. It seems nothing I said or did helped any. It just made it worse.

About 3 years ago we decided to start trying for a baby. We still haven't gotten pregnant yet. After a few months of not getting pregnant my wife just shut me out. She doesn't touch me, kiss me or even hug me. When I kiss her she just has a blank face. She said that she is sad because she's not getting pregnant, but that's as much as she will tell me. This has led to me being a bit rude towards her at times. I've gone through anger, resentment, sadness, basically everything. She wont talk about it, or even go to see a doctor with me. She says she doesn't know a good doctor and its too embarrassing. I wouldn't understand cause I'm a guy.

She once said that the only reason for sex was to have a baby, but she doesn't even want to have sex to have a baby. 

About August this year we sat down and had another talk about the no sex/intimacy. She now tells me sex has always been painful for her because I'm too big. There were times she enjoyed it, but mostly was painful. The pain is only when entering her vagina then goes away and she enjoys it. But she says this pain is stopping her from wanting sex.(Who wants painful sex right?) I tell her that's fine, but we should go see a doctor. Since then there has been nothing.

She refuses to go to a doctor, so I have no idea how to deal with her issues if she wont. So a month ago I asked if she had even googled doctors in our area, and no, she hasn't. I asked her if she even wants to fix this and she swears she does.

Which leads to last week. I'm at my ropes end and she starts making jokes about me having a small penis and masturbating. that was the last straw and I told her that she has 12 months to sort out her problem or at least try, or I'm leaving. I told her that I loved her, but I cant be in this relationship anymore if you wont even try. 

This has all left me feeling very hopeless. I'm Australian living in Japan. I'm on a spouse visa and I have my own English school. I've worked hard and it would be so painful to leave and go back to Australia to start again. Yet I don't know if I can go on.

It feels good to finally tell someone about this. My parents and her parents keep asking me when we will have a baby. It puts a lot of stress on me because little do they know, my wife doesn't want to have sex. I want to sort this out and get back to our old sex lives, have kids and grow old together. 

Thanks for reading, any advice is appreciated.

Edit;

Thank you everyone so much for the responses! I never imagined so many would take to time to tell me their stories and offer advice.
As for the long working hours, that really is just the way it is in Japan. I've tried everything I can to fight it (the reason I know have my own school), but at the end of the day I can't change a whole country. I wish my wife didn't work so much, but unlikely to change. I have been told that female teachers don't have to do club activities and other things so the workload would drastically decrease after having children.

Thank you to all the women who shared their experiences with painful sex and infertility. I had no idea that not getting pregnant could have such an impact on self esteem and cause a deep depression. I can now see that everything is basically a symptom of this. I see that it has become a horrible look of negative feedback and the only way she knows how to protect herself is to withdraw everything, even the little intimacy. I now see that I need to approach this differently. I will try again to talk to her and support her in seeing a doctor. I will definitely be showing her this thread. I think if she knew that many other couples had experienced similar things, it would really help her to feel she's not a failure.
However all that being said, if she won't even try and talk through this, see a doctor or whatever, then I have to leave for my own mental health."

My boyfriend is honestly so gross sometimes. He has a perpetually stuffy nose and I have found his boogers on walls, in the shower, on hand towels etc. whenever I hear him blow his nose I get triggered. 

This morning we are in bed sleeping and I hear him blow his nose like 6 times. Loud as hell etc. I turned around on the last one bc it was annoying and there is nothing visible that he’s blowing his nose into. So I asked him where the fuck he’s blowing his nose and he says his hand…

He has been blowing his nose and wiping his boogers god only knows where. On the blanket we both sleep with? The sheets?? I am sick and disgusted thinking about this. 

He’s M33 I’m F26. We’ve been together a bit over a year. Probably approaching 1.5 years, however we just moved in together 3 weeks ago. 

I knew he was gross, but I just can’t do this. It makes me so repulsed that I can hardly fathom having sex etc. Especially since there are probably boogers on out fucking bed. 

Every time I bring this up he gets defensive and says he can’t help his nose is stuffy etc. 

Part of this was just venting, but what would you guys do if this was your partner."

Update. 
As decided we both met on Sunday.  She was quite miserable. I haven't seen her in a while. We talked about our relationship I asked her to take down her FB post which she did.

I asked her about the Affair. Why she cheated on me
She told me that she was dumb and selfish at that time. She didn't blame me for Affair. 

She told me that they were casually talking and he started talking about his Affairs, she showed me text messages of them both, where he was bragging about his fun life outside of marriage. She told me she was curious and one thing led to another.

There were several texts where he was guiding my wife how to hide Affair. He suggested her to buy an another phone and always keep in in car. I took screenshots of everything thing.

She then asked her for forgiveness, I forgave her but I couldn't get pass this.
Divorce was my default option form beginning.
She begged to try marriage councilling
She told me she will never date anyone else ever again.
If she does it would be me.

We will still work together. As this was our both dream project. 

As for our mutual friend. Last I heard was his wife and he decided to reconcile. As kids were involved. 
I really feel sad for his wife, she didn't know what kind of monster he is.

Edit 2: I’ve had a chance to read the top comments and some controversial ones and I just wanted to say, for those of you saying that I’m selfish for making her rapes about me, do you actually think that I want to do that? Do you think I want to make her feel broken? The whole reason I asked this in the first place is because I don’t. From my perspective, this act that I enjoy doing with her so much has also caused her intense trauma in the past. 

It was eye opening getting to hear from people who have experienced this first had. She’s typically a really understanding person so I think I’ll communicate to her how I feel and make it clear that I don’t feel that way in any bad faith. We’ll see how things go from there.

Original

First of all, I don’t mean it in the way it sounds. I mean that I feel like I’m hurting her by having sex with her. 

So my girlfriend of 1.5yrs told me last week how she was forcibly raped multiple times and physically abused by her boyfriend in high school. When she told me this I kinda broke out in tears that she had to go through all of that. She told me since been in therapy for it for a long time. I knew she went, but I never asked about what it was for. 

The thing is now, I feel so bad about what happened that I don’t feel comfortable having sex with her. I know this is different because it’s 10000% consensual but I feel like I’m just violating and hurting her now when we have sex. I know this isn’t true, but I can’t shake this feeling. How can I get past this?"
15n1pf2,I (22M) watched my girlfriend (22F) dance and take shots with a groomsman at a wedding.

We started dating in college and now we both have full-time jobs. We do NOT live together but we live near each other and spend tons of time together.

&#x200B;

Last weekend we went to her cousin's 200-person, backyard wedding where my girlfriend was in the bridal party. She didn't know any of the groomsmen prior to the wedding but naturally got to know them as the night went on. As day turned into night, the dancing and partying started. All the way up to the end of the night, I stayed basically sober since I was trying to represent myself well in front of her extended family. She got very very drunk because of the event - which makes sense because it was exciting. Towards the end of the night, she started dancing with this one particular groomsman, we'll call him A, for 30+ minutes. Very handsy on the dance floor, twirling her around, etc. I just watched this from a distance. They went to the bar a couple of times and took shots together. I think it's important to give context here as well. I was very involved in celebrating earlier that night - I was dancing, requesting songs, etc. It wasn't like I was sitting on the sidelines the whole night.

&#x200B;

Later she joins me sitting at a table with her family. As she was drunkenly sitting next to me, she introduces me to a middle-aged woman guest she met that night, ''Hey \[guest name\], this is my boyfriend."" and the guest replied, ""Oh, I thought that was your boyfriend"" while pointing at A at the bar. The whole situation was very embarrassing.

&#x200B;

Two days later, on the following Monday, after she recovered and everything calmed down, I confronted her about it. Asking her questions like 'What do you think led you to do that?', 'Do you have any issues with me we can talk about or I can help clear up?', etc. Basically - let's talk, spill your feelings and I'll spill mine (i'm upset about this...). She doesn't remember doing any of that, she cried a lot about it and doesn't want to break up, and her apologies seemed very sincere. Like very very sincere.  She seemed really upset about the whole thing. I told her that I'd lost a lot of trust but I forgive you. Tbh guys, I really have no local friends where I live. I spend so much time with her that it would make a huge impact on my day-to-day if I made any drastic decisions. Kind of scared of any decision I make. I just want objective opinions about the whole thing and want to see what the average person says about it. Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

**EDIT;** Thank you for the feedback, everyone. Let me address a couple of questions/comments. 

The 'handsy' comment. Wrote that late at night and probably could've been a bit clearer. There was **never** any groping involved but more of, 'A' had his hand around her, 'A' was holding her shoulders and leaning among one another at the bar. It was not one-sided either. My girlfriend was doing the same/reciprocating it back to him. Flirty touchy if you consider touch as your love language.

'Why didn't I step in?'/'Why did you sit back and watch?': I really wanted to step in and I should've but I didn't want to be a jerk. She was nervous about this wedding for weeks and I wanted her to have a good time. Also, I didn't want to be an overcontrolling boyfriend in front of her entire extended family. All these thoughts were overcoming me at once. I probably could've nonchalantly stepped in. My bad. Live and learn.

Some people in the comments think I am overreacting but that's the whole reason why I am writing this post. I have never run into this situation before. I simply want to understand how an average person would go about this. If the consensus is that *'I need to suck it up'* then I'll do just that. I appreciate the honesty that you've given me thus far. Thank you again."

So today at school I decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. And I must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. So naturally I asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". So then I asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". After that I really just lost it and went home to sleep. It really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. My until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. How blinded could i have been? Anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure I just wanna stay away if I can and distance myself now. And yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but I can only hope these emotions will go away slowly. I guess those damn romcoms are a lie after all :)

fznvhn,Just found out my (19f) bf (21m) slept with the girl who’s in love with him the night he met me,6870,0.91,906,2020-04-12 07:27:32,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fznvhn/just_found_out_my_19f_bf_21m_slept_with_the_girl/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fznvhn/just_found_out_my_19f_bf_21m_slept_with_the_girl/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hi all. I met my bf “Jake” 6 months ago at a club (haha, remember clubs and crowded places?) We were both with groups of our friends, his group included a girl named “Anne.” Jake and I hung out that night and clicked immediately, we danced, we talked and flirted, and at the end of the night he asked me to go home with him but I don’t enjoy sex with people I don’t know so I told him I’d like to get to know him more on a date. 

We went out and things have been great so far except for one roadblock. Our friend groups have started to integrate so I spend a lot of time with his friends. Anne has liked him for a long time (as one of Jake’s friends told me about 2 weeks into the relationship) and when I asked him if this is true, he said yes but he finds her to be annoying and has never liked her back. I realllllllly hate being a “jealous girlfriend” stereotype so I wanted to leave it at that, but I have to bring up when things bother me. When Jake and I got serious, I told him that I wasn’t comfortable with him hanging out with Anne alone because her crush can be obvious at times (with the way she looks at him, talks to him, and tries to touch him.) He said okay but there have been a couple times where he has just hung out with her anyways without telling me and bringing it up later. He gives reasons like they had the same class and needed to study together, or someone else was going to come but cancelled, or no one else was free and he bored. 

I’ve tried to tell Jake that I’m not trying to be controlling or anything but I’ve been the girl with an unrequited crush and everytime you hang out with them you think of it as another shot to win the person over. I don’t care if she’s there during group hangouts but it makes my heart hurt to think of her having these very strong feelings for him and being with him alone. Oh, and a few weeks ago she was apparently crying over him not wanting to be with her, so this is a big deal for her. Jake said he’s not going to do anything & they don’t even hang out that often so I shouldn’t worry. 

Well, now that corona is happening, they obviously are not hanging out, but Anne came
up in conversation over facetime with Jake and he said he thought she would just be over him by now, and I asked if there was any reason she might think he had feelings for her back. (I really tried to not ask this is in an accusatory way, I swear.) He said no at first then said “well...” and didn’t finish his sentence. I pressured him into saying what he was about to say and he admitted that they did have sex once. I asked when this happened, he said around October. I asked if this was before we met or after. He said “technically after...” and then said that it was actually the night we met. 

So I was really upset when I heard all this. First of all, I think he should have told me that he had hooked up with Anne before because she’s in his friend circle and I just think you should tell your SO if you’re still friends with someone you’ve had sexual relationships with. His defense was that I never asked and I’ve said I don’t think sexual history should matter in a relationship, which I guess is a good point.

The second reason I’m upset about this is because things from Anne’s point of view make a little bit more sense now. We’ve never really liked each other for obvious reasons, but she has never been mean to be and I think she’s probably a nice person. She has never outwardly confessed her feelings towards Jake, even though she tells everyone else and it is fairly easy to tell she likes him, and Jake has never said anything about knowing she has feelings for him. Now, it’s one thing to like a guy and have him dodge your advantages and never mention it, but it’s kind of another to like a guy, have sex with him, and then have him never mention it again and start dating someone else. I asked Jake if he knew Anne like him at this point and he said yes, but he didn’t think it was that serious. 

Things just don’t sit right with me. Jake said he met me, he liked me, but ultimately he didn’t know me or have a commitment to me and I didn’t want to sleep with him that night so he went for something meaningless. That’s fair, I guess...But he knew Anne liked him, and after getting “rejected” by the girl he had been trying to hook up with all night, he went with someone he knew he could get easily because he was horny I guess. It just seems a bit...Sleezy, I guess?? My reason for comig to this subreddit is that should I be upset over this or am I making a big deal out of something that happened a while ago? Is there something that can be done to make me feel better? Becuase he asked what he can do and I have no idea."

I've been together with her for about 6 years and live together. I'm not the jealous type, the type of guy who questions friends, or snoops throuh phones.

The first event, we enter her car and I get a hint a cigarette smoke, nothing crazy but odd considering neither of us smoke. I say out loud ""it smells like cigarettes in here"" she then starts acting very weird and changes the subject while still acting off. Brushed it off, never smelled like cigarettes again. The second and more alarming sign was going through my clean clothes and finding a single men's white sock, alarming because I only wear black and our laundry is done at home, not at a laundromat. I question it this time a bit more sternly but without accusations, ""it's not mine, it's not yours, who's is it?"" The response was I don't know possibly when you used to do laundry at the laundromat (meaning I took it without knowing). While this response seems totally feasible I have to remind everyone that we have our own washer and dryer, i haven't used a laundromat in 3 years and when I did it was before I lived where I do now, lastly in the past 2-3 years I'm certain I would have noticed a single white sock in my sock drawer. So I'm asking everyone for help, is she cheating? Other than being up front, what should I do to have more concrete evidence towards my suspicion? Thanks."
yfnia5,My (F27) Husband (M30) thinks he shouldn't watch baby(3mo)overnight because other men don't,6859,0.95,361,2022-10-28 18:28:26,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yfnia5/my_f27_husband_m30_thinks_he_shouldnt_watch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yfnia5/my_f27_husband_m30_thinks_he_shouldnt_watch/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"On mobile sorry :(
Context: i (F27) watch my son (3mon) from 9pm-4am while my husband (M30) sleeps. He watches him from 4-8am while i sleep. I then watch him from 8-5pm while he works. Husband then watched him 5-8pm and the cycle repeats. We have a good baby, he usually wakes once or twice at night to eat.

Last night at 8pm he just exploded at me (very unlike him)that he shouldn't wake up with the baby at all. He said no husband we know does this. He kept repeating ""name one man who does"". I told him comparing us to other relationships isn't constructive and pointed out how other dads we know do extra in other ways (work overtime, have babies with colic that need extra care, etc.) He said hes tired 'of going above and beyond '

Honestly I was shocked. I've never heard him say anything like this. I asked if something happened at work or if he needed a break to tell me. I said I  try to thank him often, give him affection and tell him how great he is with our boy. But he just said 'I tell other dads I'm awake at 4 before work and they can't believe it'

He did get up at 4am last night and he left for work and we haven't spoken. 

Is our system wrong? Is this just a bruised male ego? Looking for suggestions, this is our first baby and I'm wondering how other parents navigate the night shift.  And how to navigate this sudden outburst.

many thanks

Edit: since there seems to be some confusion. I am not awake with him all night. I am responsible for him on my shift. I sleep when he sleeps so does my husband.

Edit 2: i am not a stay at home mom. I am on maternity leave for a year, standard in canada

Final update : First, I REALLY appreciate the men and women who understand that mat leave is not a vacation, and I do not just sit in my 'jammies' as someone mentioned. 

My husband came home and spoke with me on his lunch break. He apologized and said he had a rough week at work, and will work on communicating when he needs a break. He said he understands how difficult watching our son can be, and he feels guilty asking for breaks or free time. I  told him I don't mind giving him extra time here and there when he needs it but that I am not a mind reader. I also mentioned I thought he'd be proud that he is doing more than other dads he knows not envious. He said he wants to keep the schedule the same, and he enjoys having the early morning hours just the 2 of them to bond. he understands he let his feelings boil over and will work on communicating his needs.

Thank you to everyone, except the man who hates mat leave. You know who you are :)"

Here’s a quick update. You guys all really hyped me up so thanks for the thousands of pep talks, I wouldn’t have been able to muster up the courage on my own. So I told him that I didn’t enjoy sex. I could tell by his face that he already knew it wasn’t fun for me and he was frustrated I brought it up. 

basicallyyyy I asked him to please do something for me for once or I can’t do it anymore. I don’t like giving ultimatums or being confrontational like that especially knowing he is in a tough spot. But He agreed to touch me over my underwear but he was very obviously trying to distract himself when I was getting wet by kissing me. He was upset afterwards and locked himself in the bathroom. I couldn’t help but cry like it felt so fucked up, how does he get me off and then go hide in the bathroom. and he heard me so he came out and I said I hated him. Not the most constructive thing to say but I couldn’t help it. He said he couldn’t do that again and offered opening up the relationship so I could have sex with other guys and get oral from them. 

I do NOT want to be in a polygamous relationships. I am a strictly monogamous type of girl. I don’t want 2 boyfriends. So I told him that wasn’t an option and he just shrugged. I asked him if he was gay and he said no. I asked if he was sure or if he had a traumatic experience or if he’s trying to get out of doing the work. he told me we can break up if I want since he wouldn’t answer my questions. And when I told him ok it’s over, he started crying and I asked him to please tell me what was wrong and he said no. 

Basically we broke up. I wanna help him and figure out what’s wrong but he doesn’t wanna open up so there. I didn’t think he’d get emotional but yeah"

A condom broke, and I skipped my period (I think due to being sick and stressed), which doesn't often happen to me. Got a pregnancy test, fucked it up as I didn't know how to use it and it came up void.

Why do bad things have to happen all at once. Fuck me was that a stressful week. Apparently, you have to do the test first thing in the morning on a certain day?? 

Anyways, I thought I was pregnant and booked a doctors appointment so I was abit unsure for a week  or so if I was or wasnt pregnant. Good news is I wasn't, my doctor went through birth control options with me and sent me to the local sexual health clinic as they have group meetups for learning. 

&#x200B;

I have always been upfront with my boyfriend that I dont want kids and according to him neither does he. When I told him the news he was ecstatic and couldn't wait to start ""our little family"". I kept trying to remind him that I didn't want this but he was too caught up in it all. 

I sort of left him to it after that and dealt with it myself. I was stressed out as it is, I didn't need to deal with a whole other person on top of it. He clearly knew that I didn't want to be pregnant, and if it actually came down to it I will terminate the pregnancy.

Two days later he came back to me telling me he has it all sorted out. A coat hanger you might ask? no. He sorted out living arrangements for us to move in together, back in his childhood room, with his parents on the opposite side of the country. His parents were positively thrilled and his mum has tried to call me multiple times. He had started buying furniture online for us and had them delivered and told me we were going to go over the next weekend to set it up and start moving.

This is all so sudden considering at this point I didnt actually know I was pregnant. On top of that, I have met his parents once. I live near my parents and I live in my own apartment (He is in a houseshare). If I was pregnant and wanting to keep it, he had just picked the weirdest and dumbest idea. 

I haven't actually told him I'm not pregnant yet, I found out yesterday and I have all of this I want to talk about which I feel should happen in one go."

So I’m aware this is kinda a delayed update, but in all honestly after making the post I was fully prepared to leave it, move on and deal with it myself. As well as some personal issues I just didn’t really see this as a priority for me.

 I just want to say I read lots of the comments, even a few of the twitter ones, and the first thing I want to get off my chest is that: holy fuck its ‘sanguine’ not Sam Gwein, I feel like such a fucking idiot, it made research so much easier. I even watched all of lord of the rings but didn’t learn anything about them. My friend is part welsh but he didn’t know what I meant and I had to drop it quickly to avoid embarrassment. There was so many results on it online and it seemed pretty daunting, so I didn’t read much into it yet, I’m waiting for when I’m in a reading mood. 

I will just get straight to the point and say I don’t know exactly what I would call the current status on my relationship with her, but it is definitely ending.

I am thankful people recognised my situation as potentially abusive, it sounds weird but until it was pointed out, it hadn’t really clicked with me. She has always been somewhat assertive before as she works in a demanding field and knows what she wants, and I’ve been all too willing to go along with anything because she always knew better. 

For the first week after my post I skirted around the idea of saying anything to her because she gets upset very easily and I didn’t want to have a confrontation. Most arguments we had seemed one-sided and I would always compromise in the end, even doing stuff I wasn’t comfortable with - the vampire stuff isn’t the first weird horror roleplay we’ve had. I was happy to go along with the vamp stuff because it required literally hours less preparation than some of the other stuff we did. The silver lining was that I never had to do much, she would do 95% of the prep, she spent *hours* one time doing make up, and all I had to do was get a red balloon. I think that level of dedication is something I really admire about her.

Things had calmed down for the 1st + 2nd week, probably because my gf’s work had picked up and she back into doing her long hours. She had mentioned some developments into memorising me, I think to draw, she is a really nifty artist, and truth be told a nice distraction from the world events.  I have even begun cooking recently as a hobby and so leant more into that, although I struggle with cooking with meat it makes me feel sick, I’ve only really started eating it in the last few months as it made making dishes for the both of us a lot easier. 
I also reduced my smoking a quite a bit as I feel like it was harming my judgement, and I only really have a couple beers a day at most now, and I feel a lot more healthy. After this I was feeling myself in a much healthier mindset, and so a couple weeks ago at dinner I brought up the vampire stuff, although she took that to mean I wanted to progress it further. I wish I could say I was able to summarise my feelings succinctly, but for some reason as soon as I started saying I wasn’t comfortable with the direction this was all taking, I started hyperventilating and had what I think was a panic attack. My GF started crying, she thought I was having a heart attack or something, and her inhaler did fuck all as well. 

After I had calmed down, I was able to get across to her what I was trying to say, but it turned heated quite quickly. She said I was trying to shame her but all I was trying to say was that I didn’t want to bleed, its not normal to go through these many plasters. I had aimed that as a joke which is the go-to method to defuse a situation, but she did not consider it funny at all, which is stupid because I’m the one who is being bled.

We didn’t really talk for a couple of days and tensions were high, but we had a rational discussion a few days ago where we came to the conclusion the relationship wasn’t working. Obviously, we can’t just up and leave right now, so we are still together for the time being, but once we can freely move about, we can split up and move away from each other. I think this is quite a healthy resolution, I am sorry if some of you expected something more horrifying in this update, and I won’t lie, some of the comments I read had me seriously worried for my life, but I know her better than you would based on a single internet post, and she is a good person. 

TLDR – We had a talk and we will split up once everything is pretty much open again"
9j1nkq,(Update) I (35M) caught my wife (29F) rehearsing a speech for my funeral (?),6820,0.86,956,2018-09-26 17:00:26,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9j1nkq/update_i_35m_caught_my_wife_29f_rehearsing_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9j1nkq/update_i_35m_caught_my_wife_29f_rehearsing_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"OP: [ttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i\_35m\_caught\_my\_wife\_29f\_rehearsing\_a\_speech\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i_35m_caught_my_wife_29f_rehearsing_a_speech_for/)

Tl;Dr overheard my wife talking about me as if I was dead, she said she was reading a book out loud

There were 2 edits to this OP

1 - To clarify I don't believe this woman is capable of murder one

2 -  I looked through her browser history (not snooping, but details won't matter) and she is shopping for wedding dresses?

&#x200B;

Update:

Met a buddy for lunch and told him the whole tale. He too found it morbid af, but did't see her committing first degree murder. Asked me if I thought she could be having an affair (he has a history with weird stuff turning out to be cheater SO). Suggested I get a PI in case of cheating, and call my lawyer in case of murder.

I said I'll consider it. But I know my wife, she is usually pretty shy. I'm still REALLY thinking this might be something silly that got her embarrassed. Was it any other topic, I'd have asked right away. The funeral thing just got me creeped out and I probably would leave it alone if not for my growing curiosity.

Buddy makes a point that there is no harm in calling my lawyer just to check on the procedure to change beneficiaries on life insurance and such, so I'm prepared in the event things go even more weird. I agree, no harm in that. Call the lawyer, tell him I'm discussing finances with the wife and we are thinking about changing both our beneficiaries (trying not to make it look like I suspect her, you know), he says he's stepping into a restaurant with a client can he call me back.

I move on with my work, have a long day, so, honestly, I forget about it.

When I get home late at night, my wife is *upset*. And that is an understatement.

I am quickly educated on two things that happened on her day:

1 - Lawyer called. He wasn't able to get a hold of me anywhere else. Was wondering what were the questions we had about changing the beneficiaries on life insurances. Wife had no idea what he was talking about. He seemed uncomfortable upon hanging up.

2 - Turns out my buddy talked to his wife (in confidence) and told her everything. His wife told a couple of close friends (in confidence) as well. And on it went until the gossip reached a friend of my wife's who actually knew what was happening. She called my wife and told her she should talk to me asap.

She is mortified. Upset, hurt, confused, embarrassed. The whole deal. A little mad as well. Maybe more than a little.

She tells me she joined a community theater, drama club, something, and will be playing a widow. The monologue is an acting exercise to tap into emotions. (Which btw is something many of you told me was a possibility, so thank you, you were right). Her friend (the one who knew what was going on) was the one who convinced her it would be a good idea, to help her out with her shy personality.

She lied about it being a book because she too thinks it is a creepy thing to do, and didn't feel like sharing at the time, since the whole drama club is something she was doing for herself. But she thought I only heard her speaking, as in ""her voice"", not ""what she was saying"". Had she known what I heard, she would have explained it.

I ask her why didn't she tell me about the drama club. She looks at me like I have no business asking her another question for as long as we both shall live, not even about the weather. But she says it is ""her thing"" and she even made her friend promise not to mention it because she didn't want all of us at one of the plays (we are a tight bunch) until she was more comfortable on stage.

I say she could have just told me, to which she replies with something like ""are you telling me that you can keep something private that happens in our household to yourself without bringing all our friends into it?""

After the latest events I don't have an answer for her.

But I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. So I ask ""what about the wedding dress?"".

This is when I realize this part of the story didn't reach her yet. She asks me ""what"" and I have the pleasure of telling my wife I went through her personal computer.

**Now** she is homicidal.

Grabs me by my shirt, drags me up to our closet and shows me ""the wedding dress"" (in the making) for the play. It is amateur theater, so they have more than one job and she is also helping with the costumes, wardrobe, whatever it is called. She was looking online for cheap dresses or for styling ideas to make her own (she is quite skilled in making clothes and such, and the search history did say ""old"" or ""vintage"" wedding dress). She also shows me nun's clothes and a pirate's in her closet and asks me if that means she is attacking the British. By now I am just wondering what the fuck is this play about? A bride, a pirate and a nun? Who the fuck is writing this shit? But I'm guessing I shouldn't be talking anymore.

She is pissed that I would think she is capable of murder enough to call our lawyer, that I told all our friends about her embarrassing monologue and went through her personal computer. Not to mention ruining the drama club she was enjoying.

I just nod, apologize profusely, try to explain that things didn't happen quite like that, and show myself to the guest bedroom because we both know where this is going.

She then tells me I can't even sleep there. Since my brother and his wife will be staying with us for a few days, she already changed the sheets and had everything cleaned and ready and says ""you will just make a mess""

So last night I had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr Wife was practicing my eulogy, turns out it was a play. I got to sleep on the couch and am currently hoping she wont file for divorce.

&#x200B;

Edit just to be safe: I realize I took some liberties with my writing.

Just to make it clear: I think she was more upset with the version of the story that reached her than the actual facts. It will take her a moment to process the stuff (what actually happened) I told her. Also, she didn't use any literal physical violence against me. That was just bad writing on my part.

You all be good, you wonderful people

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

People calling it bullshit made me smile. People saying the fact I didn't answer to those calls proves that it is bullshit made me smile some more.

I mean no disrespect, but I have a job, guys.

Look, I had a weird problem and I want to say ""thank you"" to everyone who took a few moments of their days to help a stranger. I was creeped out and you all truly helped, so thank you!

To the ones asking for more details... I mean, I could say my wife is a Pilates instructor who has most of her day to herself, that our study is a mess of fabric and half made clothes so she could be working on costumes for the whole Cirque du Soleil and I would still be oblivious, I could answer every single question you all have until my fingers went raw, but let's face it: it would be pointless. And I would have to share more personal details than I am comfortable with. I even mentioned on comments I kept some details (and people) out of the story for this very reason.

So thank you to the ones who believed me enough to help, I read all the comments, though I couldn't answer them all. This update was for you, since I received more help than I thought I would, when I first posted. You guys were amazing.

Thank you to the ones who called it bullshit as well, you guys keep this sub in check. It's part of the ride.

And if you are neutral, but my story amused you. Thank you for stopping by and you are welcome.

To the ones suggesting I should post on TIFU, I might later if I get some time.

I haven't read all the comments yet, not even close, but I will do my best to!

Hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. I guess I'm kind of in a spot to update now.

So, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. I heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were Max in their own families and you all told me what I should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

I resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after I posted, midway through their custody week. Many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but I wanted to deliver the message before having to take Max again. I was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

The meeting did not go well. They were both pretty mad at me. I had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. I told myself just to be polite and firm, that I didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""I'm sorry, its not working out"". I guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that I was fucking up. In hindsight I do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that I regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment I really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. Then, he said something about how I wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. That made me very mad. Thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. I have some different opinions on ""fairness"". I said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then I stormed out and I didn't talk to the boys.

I didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. They immediately were asking about why Max wasn't with them and I, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than I had up to this point. I talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with Max, but that I'm their father and that Max has his own father to spend time with. I also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that I don't like having to spend only every other week with them. That their mother's decision to start another family with Max's father and Max still makes me sad. This is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. I've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant I haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. If you can't say anything nice, as they say.

Trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. I don't want to blame their mother, but I also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what I mean. This would be one of the situations I identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means I have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""She decided"".

I think I actually did a good job navigating the conversation. My sons absorbed it easier than I expected. A few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

I have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. I sort of feel like I want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that I'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. I think she remains upset with me, more for the things I said than the rejection of this arrangement with Max. Or maybe that's just projection, because that's what I feel guilty for. I also regret that the last time I spoke to Max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. I don't know. I guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but I don't know how sturdy that story will be.

Rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how I talked about Max. I know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so I'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. I'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and I am obligated to interact with her politely so I guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto Max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

So, I sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. Contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.
Thanks to almost everyone who commented or reached out to me."

I didn't have enough evidence to request an ex parte, aka emergency child custody. So my lawyer and I had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. We got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

We also had to be very wary of the signs. He in fact quit his job and on a realtors page I saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. That and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

I couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. We tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 I got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. My daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). My ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. Which was stupid because even without the decree I had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could request the passport.

After that things went actually very fast. He was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that MIL had bought 3 tickets with no return date to Mexico. I could request an ex parte. After a shit ton of documents I submitted it. In most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. We had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. Atm I have sole custody for my daughter. This is all temporary. My ex has visitation rights if I was present but he can't take her anywhere. This is once the investigation of him is closed. 

I was cursed out by my ex and ex MIL and they said they will try to Contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

My daughter will continue in therapy. Specially after this. I will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

This was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. I don't think that I will update again but I wanted to thank you all for your Tipps and support. I am really thankful as I am finally not anxious the whole time! Thank you really much!"

There are very few, if any, times during the year when I have the luxury to take a few days off to myself. When I get home from work, between cooking dinner, doing dishes, and taking care of chores around the house, I get maybe 2 hours a day to relax. My wife gets upset if I don't spend all of that time with her. So I don't get to watch my shows, play my video games, or read my books. I've told her many times that I need time to relax and do the things I enjoy, and she'll agree with me, but then start giving me things to do or try to get me to do something else with her within 30 seconds of me starting.  

So two months ago, I asked my boss if I could use a week of vacation between Christmas and New Year's. It's a slow week and we made arrangements to ensure that I am covered during those days for emergencies.  

I told my wife that this will be my me time to do all of the things that I want, to destress from life, and to catch up on the things that I really enjoy. I also planned to clean up my office and organize my files, which is something that has stressed me out for a while. My wife agreed and told me that she was very happy I'm going to be able to do some self care.  

This weekend, she informed me that she had scheduled the chimney cleaners for Wednesday because I'd be home. She wrote down a list of things for me to do. Go to Home Depot, clean up the yard debris, pick up groceries for the week, go through boxes in the basement and organize everything.  

I politely informed her that I would not be doing any of those things, that this week was about self care and addressing my needs, and with only 4 real days (minus Christmas) I was not going to add additional tasks. She told me to just get to what I had time for.  

On Tuesday, my wife decided to work from home. This prevented me from organizing my office since we share an office. I put on one of my video games and started to play. Ten seconds later, my wife came flying in and told me to turn it off because it was too loud while she was trying to make phone calls. I told her to shut the office door, but she told me it was entirely too loud and sounded unprofessional in the background.  

So I pulled out a book and started reading on the couch. I did that for about an hour when my wife decided to come out into the living room and work on her laptop. She turned on The Kardashians. I sarcastically asked if that wouldn't make her sound unprofessional in the background. She replied, ""I'll just mute it if a call comes in."" Which is exactly what she did.  

So after 15 minutes of trash TV and loud business phone calls, I went into our bedroom to read my book. At this point, my wife kept interrupting me every few minutes. ""How's the book?"" ""How much more do you have to go?"" ""What's it about?"" ""Do you want lunch?"" ""What do you want for dinner?"" ""Are you still on the same book?"" ""Do you want to watch something on TV?"" ""Am I ruining your day?"" ""Do you not want to spend time with me?"" ""Do you know where the black water bottle went?""  

Eventually it was time for dinner, so I just gave up and put my book down.  

Today, she decided to work from home again. I told her it wasn't necessary. She told me that she wanted to work from home. I replied, ""Yes, but no offense, I do not want you here.""  She laughed and said, ""I know, it's your self care week, but I don't feel like going in. We can both be here.""  

So I could not be in the office, I had to be up early for the chimney cleaners, and could not be in the living room because they were working in there. I went into our bedroom and started reading my book. She came in and informed me that I needed to stay with the chimney sweepers in case they had questions because she had work calls that she had to take. I was unable to concentrate with them working, so I just sat there.  

When they finally finished, I took my book out and started reading. That's when my wife decided to come out into the living room and turn on The Kardashians again. I migrated into the bedroom, laid down on the bed, and continued reading my book. Ten minutes later, she came in with her laptop and laid down on the bed next to me. I did my best to ignore the typing and phone calls and just concentrate on my book. Then she started snoring. Not heavy breathing, but literal congested wheezing, choking, snoring. I sighed, got up, headed into the living room, laid down on the couch and put one of my shows on. That lasted 15 minutes before my wife came in and started talking through it. She kept asking questions about it, criticizing it, talking about how it's clear why she wouldn't watch it, asking how many episodes there are, how long each episode is, and so on. Finally after needing to rewind the same part eight times, I accepted defeat and turned it off.  

My wife informed me that she thinks she's going to work from home the rest of the week. She saw the look on my face, smiled and said, ""I know, I'm cramping your style and ruining your week off, but it's a quiet week and it works for me to be home.""  

I told her, ""I love spending time with you, but I need my alone time. I haven't been able to do anything for me and it is damaging to my mental health.""  

She insists that she understands and she wants me to have time to myself, but it seems to be in theory only, not in practice. I have found myself snapping at her and being terse with her and I do not want that. I am afraid that I am going to explode on her. I don't know how to make myself any clearer but she doesn't seem to be taking me seriously.   

TL:DR Wife ruined my time off that was specifically for my mental health and doesn't seem to understand/accept that I am verging on a breakdown."

I used too see her once in a while. She was always a quiet child. She didn't speak much to me. I always remember thinking something was wrong with my stepfather. He just didn't seem like a nornal person.

So, he died in an accident and I was asked if I was willing to adopt her. I and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. We were actually so happy. My daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. She was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

But yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. I told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

But she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. I was really taken aback by what I heard. My wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and I was really shocked. 

My stepdad was an asshole and a predator. I don't want to get into explicit details but he used to hit her, and sexually harass her. I actually cried for so long because I couldn't imagine this innocent girl going through that. How do I help her?"

Me and my GF, Naomi are an interracial couple, with her being Korean and me being black. We have dated for just under 5 years now, and for the past few months I’ve been planning on proposing. I’m pretty traditional so I thought it would be a good idea to ask Naomi’s dad for his blessing before I proposed. I asked earlier this month. When I arrived at their house I was greeted by Naomi’s mother and father who invited me in. After a little talking I told them that I was going to propose and wanted their blessing. Her mother was ecstatic, and her father didn’t seem displeased and he told me it was okay for me to propose. We talked more and the topic of babies was brought up by her mother, I told her that I wanted to have kids with her, and she got even happier. We continued talking, when I told them I needed to start heading home her mother said she would send me home with some food and left for the kitchen.

Me and her dad have a small language barrier between us that usually is alleviated by either Naomi or her mother, so we kinda just sat there in silence. He then told me this, I’ll clean it up, but it was difficult to understand as He isn’t great at English. 

“You are a very nice young man and we like you a lot. We’d be happy to have you in our family, but our we are not too happy about you and her having dark babies.”

I was stunned, and kinda just awkwardly laughed. We sat there for another 2 minutes before her mom came out with a wrapped plate. When I got home, I said nothing about this to Naomi. I know I need to talk to her about what was said, but I don’t want to be the one that accuses her family of being racists. And I know this is probably irrational but the way her father said it, put the thought in my head that Naomi may not want kids because of how dark I am. How do I approach her about this in the least accusatory way as possible?"

Using a throwaway because my main can be identified.

My 25 F parents and I are really close emotionally but not geographically. They live abroad and I see them a couple times a year, but we speak pretty much every day. 

A few months ago I started getting some weird symptoms (unexplained weight loss, fatigue, abdo pain etc) and went to the doctor who referred me for more tests. Because I didn't want to worry my parents before we knew it was anything to worry about, my partner 27 M (together 10 years) and I kept it to ourselves.

Many tests later, including some very uncomfortable scans and a biopsy and it turns out that I have incurable bowel cancer and have a year or so at most. Which sucks. 

No one knows yet except my partner but I need and want to tell my parents so that it's not a complete shock to them when I see them in a few months (I'm due to visit in November and I really need that visit to be as happy as it can be) and also because I need them. 

How the hell do I approach this conversation? It doesn't feel like something I can just drop into a phone call, but the thought of flying out to them to tell them in person is pretty daunting. Also for my partner's sake I want to tell them soon because aside from me he's the only one who knows (didn't want a well-meaning relative from his side posting something on social media or any risk of my family hearing it from anyone else) and this is really hard on him. He needs someone other than me he can talk to about it.

Any advice would be so welcome. Thank you."
1ev7w3z,Boyfriend (25M) became disabled and I (25F) want to break up but I'd feel like a terrible person. How do I handle this?,6748,0.97,1684,2024-08-18 17:48:38,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ev7w3z/boyfriend_25m_became_disabled_and_i_25f_want_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ev7w3z/boyfriend_25m_became_disabled_and_i_25f_want_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Throwaway acc because I have friends who know my real reddit name.

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) since high school. Unfortunately, he got into a car crash and became disabled below his waist. I wished to be by his side during his recovery. Disabilities have never been a deal-breaker for me, and I loved him, so while this is going to be a struggle at first, I believed that we'd be able to overcome this.

I tried to participate in his recovery by being there with and for him during physical therapy, I moved into his parents' house to help his parents to take care of him because he is unable to do many tasks without assistance. My job is very close to their parents' place, and my manager allows me to clock-out in case my BF's parents need my help with things like getting my boyfriend to the hospital and such.

But my boyfriend just completely shut down. I understand that this is a life-changing injury and at such a young age this is absolutely devastating, but he just doesn't want me anywhere near him. I tried to take him out to concerts, plays, organize picnics, trips - just make him believe that his life didn't end with his injury and he is capable of living a fulfilling life. But he was just indifferent to it all. Therapy doesn't seem to help him because he still seems to be completely dissociated from everything.

I couldn't see him like this anymore and I demanded to tell me everything that's on his mind, and he just said that he is angry about everything, that he feels like I'm here only out of moral obligation, that he doesn't feel like a proper boyfriend because he can't do anything for himself, that he wants to be a ""real man"" but he isn't even able to make love to me anymore etc. I tried to be empathetic and told him that if I've been here for this long after the accident, it's obviously not an issue to me because I still love him. He just scoffed and it seemed like he didn't believe me.

Now it's come to a point where he's throwing things at me demanding me to leave the room. He's ignoring me, and when he's not, he insults me. He's even throwing the food I bring him on the floor like a child. He became emotionally abusive, and I'd be lying if I said that I still love him. I genuinely wanted to be there for him because I've seen stories where people after intense physical therapy manage to get back on their feet and walk with some assistance, and I believed that he might be able to do it too - I believe that miracles exist, and the human body is a fascinating thing, maybe he'd be able to walk again, he just needed a lot of work and faith in himself. But he became so nasty, rude, hurtful that... I dunno, I think I just fell out of love with him.

I approached his mum and told her that I feel like I probably don't love him anymore because he's been so hurtful towards me for 2+ years now, and I just can't endure it anymore. I don't deserve this. His mum immediately got defensive saying that he's suffered a great psychological trauma after the accident and it's normal for him to be so depressed. I completely understand that but it doesn't give him a green light to be so hurtful towards people who are actually trying to help him. His mum asked me to stay because my boyfriend needs my support, but judging from his behavior he doesn't want or need me at all. Maybe he's doing it on purpose to push me away, but at this point I don't care anymore - I can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.

I'm tired. I tried for a long time. He shut me out. I want to break up with him, but I'd feel like an absolute trash human being for leaving a person behind when they need me the most. But at the same time I can't endure this anymore. I want to leave, but I don't want to be ""that person"", if you know what I mean.

I am at a loss. I need advice."

My living at home is largely because my mother has 3 children that are younger than I am and she works a ton, and when she’s not working she’s sleeping, so I am essentially their primary caregiver. It is to the point where I watch and take care of my little siblings more than my mom does, and they listen to me more than they do her. I love them more than life itself, but being a caregiver to children I never had is exhausting. Especially since she pays me very very little for it, and I can’t get a job because they’d have nowhere to go if I did. I am stuck caring for them, but it is worth it because they need a mom figure. 

My mom has been acting weird lately, so I figured she was pregnant. I found a paper in her bag that confirmed just that, and I have no idea what to do. I cannot take care of another child that I had no say in creating. I can’t do it. I’m exhausted and I just can’t. She’s only been with her boyfriend for a couple of months, and I have no doubt that he’ll leave and leave her a single mom again. Which will make me have to step up and be a parent. If I have to do it all over again, I want to get a job and leave. Even if I have to juggle a full time job and college, it seems like the better option. But my mother will likely refuse to get child care for my little siblings. And my oldest little siblings are too young to have to deal with this. And I can’t leave them here alone. I want to voice this to her but I don’t even know what I’m expecting and I’m terrified that it’ll completely shatter my already shaky relationship with my mom. What do I do? She hasn’t even announced it to us yet, but Ive been sobbing nonstop since I found out. Do I say something, and if so, how do I say it?"

It's like a perfect relationship. We've been steady, we're genuinely happy in love.

Just when I was already contemplating on proposing to her, I felt like she's gone cold for the past month. Just this valentines, we were on top of the world surprising one another with gifts and sweet nothings. But the following weeks felt different.

Her ""I love yous"" weren't as enthusiastic. The way she talks and communicates with me feels different. She easily gets upset over trivial things. She seems to be a different person all of a sudden. I actually asked her what's wrong, but she assures me everything is ok and something is just bugging her.. I asked again but it seems she doesn't want to open up.. She assures me though that she loves me very much.

Then, just recently, like 4 days back, I was reminded that she has a spare phone just sitting on my drawer, phone was dead and was not used for almost la year. So I grabbed on a charger, booted it up.. and it so happened that her google account is still logged in on the device. Curious, I went to see what she's been up to lately, then I discovered her recent searches /history in google and youtube. I was shocked and I dont know how to react. The searches go like this:

* I cheated on him
* i cheated on him many times
* I cheated should we break up
* Breaking up a long term relationship... and so on

The searches were dated Feb 15 onwards. Almost everyday she looks on the same searches and other related topics.

I am devastated discovering this. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep. But I haven't confronted her about this.

What should I do? Do I need to confront her? We are currently far apart now due to work, but we will be seeing each other next week. I am confused, I am in shock, idk how to react. Please help."
ckjpjz,My Fiancée isn’t speaking to me after I used “our” money to help my dog.

First couple vet visits didn’t show anything until eventually we felt a large lump under his fur which was later identified as a tumor. It was confirmed to be malignant and required surgery to remove completely. 

The vet I spoke to said it would likely cost over $5000 to remove it completely and there’s no guarantee it will be a success. I don’t know why the cost was so high, but it didn’t matter to me. My dog is my dog and there is no question in my mind that paying for the surgery was the right thing to do. 

I paid for the surgery out of my own savings. This is important. My fiancée and I have separate finances and my savings are easily 5x what she had saved up. When she found out how much the surgery cost, she went ballistic that I paid for the surgery without asking her when we’re planning a wedding. She says that she will have to downsize her wedding to compensate, and that my dog is already so old (10) the money “wouldn’t go far.” I can’t even comprehend how she could say that to me.

I honestly can’t empathise with her here, which has caused a massive rift in a previously amazing relationship. My dog is my dog and he’s a member of the family. I refuse to put a few thousand dollars over his well-being. My fiancee is acting as though I’m being selfish and that our wedding should come first, since we’re starting a family.

She hasn’t talked to me since other than to tell me to take out the garbage, clean the dishes, etc. If I try to engage conversation she will shut down or walk away. She refuses to talk this over unless I get on my knees, grovel and apologise. I can’t bring myself to do this as a matter of principle and self respect.

So my question for people here is how am I supposed to get her to talk to me and patch things up? I don’t want to throwaway the relationship, but at the same time I feel this is something I cannot compromise on..."

Turns out she met him out of work once (as 'friends'), I hit the roof, she said sorry, blah blah, the usual. He left her work and got another job a few weeks later (unrelated). A few months later she asked how i felt if she met him to 'catch up' as he had left her work, i was not happy at all and made it known, she said she told me about it to be clear and honest, no funny business, etc. I said again, I'm not happy but do whatever because otherwise I'm 'controlling' but I trust her to make the right decision. She still met him.

At this point i'm ready to call time on this shit BUT - We have a mortgage. I need to get financial advice regarding this. We're not married.

Fast forward last night.

I caught her sitting on our sofa sending lewd selfies (lifting her top etc), however there's a twist. So obviously I've suspected this shit for months, I popped upstairs and left my phone upright on a desk near the sofa recording... And boom, played back the video a little later and saw it. 

&#x200B;

So where do I stand in this. It feels awkward because I secretly filmed this (which I know is fucking weird but i suspected something, needed to know, and well.. It turns out I was correct).

What should I do? I can bet without doubt it will be turned on me 'having trust issues' or something and what I did will make me the fucking bad party in this. Make no mistake, I'm fuming, I blame her in this, not the guy. It takes two to tango."

After reading tons of replies in the thread and all of the positive stories about girls who dated guys with thumb dicks, I was able to tell her about my peewee issue without feeling very embarrassed. I opted for a playful serious way to talk about it with her, so I told her that I had a micropenis and that I was serious. She asked me how big it was and I said that it was in the 2 inch region, give or take a bit. She said that she didn't expect it to be so small and that she wished I told her sooner, but she said that it's okay as long as I make it up to her in other ways. ;)

We decided that since I'm gonna have to make up for my lack of a fun-rod, we'll just buy toys that I can use on her and give each other the good ol mouth treatment. After she took it well, I jokingly told her that since my penis is around the size of one of her thumbs, we should have a thumb war and that instead of my thumb, I can use my penis in battle. She took it well and we both laughed about the joke and continued on with our day.

Anyways, I can successfully say that we did it Reddit! Thank you all for your stories and advice, it really helped me out a lot. Looks like we're in it for the long run without any issues."

My wife and I have been together for 10 years. Married for 5. We met in college and has been the love of my life since.

2 days ago she told me she doesnt love me anymore and for her happiness wants our relationship to end.

I probably should have seen this coming, our relationship has been rocky since we met but for whatever reason I always wanted to make it work. 

We have 3 kids together, all under the age of 6. They are amazing and so happy and the best thing from our marriage.

Financially, my wife is a stay at home mom. She owns our house outright from family money. She has no student loans but also no college degree. I make a fairly decent income and support our family. 

Since my wife doesnt have a job and no way to pay bills, she wants me to move into her finished basement and continue to pay utilities and food for us and our kids, in addition to keeping her on my health insurance. She wants to take time to get her degree and file for dissolution afterwards, so she can support herself and our kids.

She also wants this for continuity for our kids. While she doesnt love me anymore, she doesnt want me out of our kids lives even weekly, and still wants to be friends with me.

I'm honestly dying inside right now, because as rocky as our relationship has been I've never loved her less, and she has been all I've ever loved or wanted.

I dont know how to proceed or even feel at this point. Im terrified because I've let my friendships go since we've been married and while my family will support me i dont have many friends left. I'm terrified about finances. I'm terrified of not being able to be happy without her. Honestly i'm so confused about everything going on in my head.

On top of that, is it stupid to stay in the house for our kids? It would be convenient for me financially too as even though if I moved out we would share custody, I dont have to pay child support this way. It's also better for my taxes. 

I'm just so lost I dont know what to think. Sorry for the long winded ramble."

University offers here came out today and I got my second preference which is a different university to the one my bf is currently in. 
We are interested in studying the same course so we would be in some of the same classes if I go to the same university. 
However, his university isn’t convenient to get to for me and reputation isn’t as good as the one I got offered. 
His reasoning is that he worries that I will meet other guys at another university, and wants to be with me.

I always read items on this sub bust never thought I’d be posting on it, especially about this...

So here’s the context, my girlfriends sisters wedding was on the weekend. They were having a fairly low key wedding and I offered to help where I could, setting up the reception area etc which was all fine. I work at a gym so we have a portable PA system with microphone for the group fitness classes. They were going to hire a PA system but I told them to save the money and I’ll let them borrow the one from my gym, I set it up so the grooms phone would connect via Bluetooth as all he wanted to do was play a Spotify playlist throughout the night and use the PA for the speeches. 

On the day everything was going fine, everyone was seated and went quiet for the groom to talk so someone turned the PA system on. This is where it all went horribly wrong... my phone automatically connected to the speaker and started playing what was on my phone last... this happened to be porn from the night before, porn sounds started playing from speaker in front of everyone including the brides and grooms families... I grabbed my phone out of my pocket to stop the sounds, the groom laughed slightly and continued... my girlfriend saw me get out my phone and press pause on it so she clearly knew that porn was coming from my phone. She didn’t say anything at the time however I went home and now she isn’t responding to any of my messages and I don’t know what to do? Do I leave it for a few days or keep trying to get in touch with her. Any advice would help I don’t know what to do... "

I’ve been so cooperative and supportive through all of her relationship. I used to date her boyfriend years ago and he treated me like royalty and would take me out everywhere and she was my friend through it all. About a year ago I guess they hit it off and I decided to distance from him (we were still friends) out of respect for her. 
She constantly vents to me about ME and about how he doesn’t treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn’t understand it. I feel terrible but there is nothing I can do, I don’t understand it either. I’ve always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but I guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. She blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. Reminder; I haven’t spoken to him outside of when I’m with both of them together in a year!!! 
He has called her by my name before but it’s always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
She insists we cannot be friends and I tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.
Advice??


UPDATE: after going through ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS (yes I read all of them) I feel there is some stuff to clear up. She asked me for permission to date him and I gave her the go ahead which is why him and I distanced. It was a mutual agreement, he also said that it would be best if we distanced for her sake. Our interactions are minimal at get togethers or whenever I go to see her because THEY LIVE TOGETHER. he has never been flirty or creepy towards me so I do believe it’s an honest mistake. As for the comments that state that I “am clearly not over him” that relationship died years ago and I am with somebody happily. I want to take your advice and just “drop them” but this is years of friendship I want to save...

UPDATE #2: First of all thank you guys so much for the replies and help, you guys have, if anything, reassured me I did nothing wrong. I was not too sure before. I am also aware that this may not be a friendship worth saving as she has always been this way, always had to be right and I have always put in more effort. However, I do not mean to make this about something else but after high school I have been left with 2 friends, one of which was her. It’s hard to think about my life being more empty than it already is and I feel like every single year I have less and less people in my life even though I am TRYING SO HARD to keep them around. I have been there for her and friends with her for 10 years and never through her fuckups even thought about ending the friendship. I’m just left wondering, once again, what it is about me that made everyone disappear after high school. Again, sorry if I’m turning this into something else. It’s not my intention but the need to save the friendship is deeper than just “oh I just want to be friends”"

Edit 3: I picked up the damn phone out of curiosity. Holy shit. I was assaulted when tried to take it from me.  

Edit 4: Phone is still with me. I;m taking screenshots. I paid for it by credit card. My name on the contract.

Edit 5: Ok I'll get some therapy. Anger management or domestic violence? Same thing I guess.

Edit 6: Waiting for her to return before I do anything. Need to video myself leaving my apartment untouched and in peace for my own safety.  "
bfggs7,My (26F) husband (31M) cheated at his bachelor party,6659,0.94,1079,2019-04-21 01:36:38,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bfggs7/my_26f_husband_31m_cheated_at_his_bachelor_party/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bfggs7/my_26f_husband_31m_cheated_at_his_bachelor_party/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I don’t know what to do. We got married in December and things were perfect. We’ve been together since I was 23. 

His friend is getting married and I noticed one of his other friends give my husband a funny look when talking about the new bachelor party. Like raising his eyebrows and laughing. My husband did not react and ignored him but I knew something was up. 

We allow each other on our phones so he was sleeping one night, I was awake, I saw it and got tempted. Went through messages and pictures. I saw a few things in his photos in the “hidden” album, he didn’t really hide it too well but we don’t go on each other’s phones so he probably thought he was fine. I saw a video and a couple of pictures of a girl blowing my husband. It was fucking disgusting. He actually bought me a necklace when he came back, just realized he probably felt guilty or something. 

I read through his messages and saw his friends mentioning the party while planning the new one. He apparently snorted coke off some girls boobs too. My husband was telling them to forget about it and it was a long time ago and he was just having fun for one night and it would never happen again and he’s committed to our marriage. He is so full of shit 

And I got pregnant on our honeymoon. I don’t know what to do. How do I bring it up. What do I say. I feel so sick and dizzy ever since I found out. And I was at home, having a quiet tea party with my friends, opening up presents and talking about house decor. I feel so fucked over!! I can’t believe he would do this to me"
1d7qtz4,"My daughter (18f), against my (45f) advice, decided to come out to my wealthy, bigoted parents. They have now disowned her, and now I am being blamed. What can I do to fix this?",6655,0.94,868,2024-06-04 12:19:23,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d7qtz4/my_daughter_18f_against_my_45f_advice_decided_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d7qtz4/my_daughter_18f_against_my_45f_advice_decided_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,6,,text,True,False,False,"This is going to be long, but I need some real help here because I just don't know what the hell I'm doing any more.

I'm (45f) a single parent to two children (17m and 18f), and the unfortunate daughter to two boomers (both 70's).

My parents are the epitome of the white, wealthy boomer stereotype. They are entitled, racist, sexist, MAGA-brained bigots who abuse service workers for sport and think that attending church on Sundays makes them good Christian people. They are also stinking filthy rich due to them capitalizing on a series of business ventures in the 1970-80's + generational wealth, so they're packing seven figure bank accounts.

My entire life my parents have held their money over my head as a tool in order to get me to do what they wanted. In my teens I ended up rebelling and going no contact with them, but when I became pregnant by my late husband, he convinced me to give them a second chance and let them back into my life. Since we reconnected they have never given me a dime for my own costs, and even after I lost my husband, they only ever helped pay off the hosue my husband and I had bought together, but this was purely to keep the roof over their grandkid's heads, not their daughter's. In spite of that though, they have truthfully been pretty good grandparents to my kids, and they have always known that they would fund them through college and that, on their passing, they were set to inherit millions.

The issue began four months ago when my daughter came out to me. I was so, so proud of her! And that I had successfully fostered an environment where she felt safe enough to open up to me like this, I was so happy! Afterwards she broached the topic of extending the news to her grandparents, and that's where my smile faded.

The following is an abridged version of what I told her:

""I want you to be your true self, and I will never deny you that, but your grandparents come from a very different world to the one you and I occupy. If they learn that you're gay, it's not just that they won't be able to understand you—they are going to actively punish you for it. Everyday the world is becoming more and more difficult just to exist in, and your generation are eventually going to be facing challenges that my generation will never have to deal with. I want you to be safe and secure as you go forward in life, but because your father is no longer here to help support us, I've not been able to do right by you financially the way I wish I could have. If you come out to grandma and grandpa though, you will not be their gay granddaughter, to them you will just be another ""f\*g"". They will cut you off. That will mean no more expensive gifts, no more car, no more free ride to college, no more private apartment, no inheritance, nothing. They will take everything.""

I told her that I was by no means asking her to stay in the closet, she can still live her life as out and proud as she wants! Get a girlfriend! Experiment sexually! But just do not advertise it on social media, and definitely not do it around my parents. My parents are old. They don't get out much any more, and mostly just spend their time going back and forth between church, the store, and home where they sit around reading conspiracies on Facebook. They are also not in good health, and I do not see them lasting more than 7-10 years. I told her that if she plays her cards right and lays low around them, she will never have to struggle the way so many of her friends are struggling, and that when the time comes she can choose to bury them in a rainbow coffin if she wishes.

At the time she seemed sad, but she said that she understood, and we hugged it out. And that was that. Until it wasn't.

My daughter has an online circle of queer friends that she speaks with daily through her Diskord, and they have been filling ears with things like how she needs to come out to them, how by not embracing her identity fully she still has one foot in the closet, that even if her grandparents react negatively, at least she'll be living her ""authentic self"". Since she started bringing it up I have been trying to drill into her just what a terrible idea this was, often and repeatedly, and I thought she was listening.

Well, it happened. We had my parents over for dinner, and she decided to stand up in the middle of dessert and come out to them. She had this whole speech prepared, about how she knows that they are from a different time, about how the world changes, and how they will have to learn to change too, but that she knows deep down that they will come to accept her in time. It was like watching a car crash in slow motion, only my daughter was in the driver seat, and the brake was completely out of my reach. After she was finished my parents just gathered their things and walked out.

That was a month ago, and they have since disowned her completely. Last week we received then news that they have written her out of their will. They have cancelled he phone contract and taken back the car that was in their name. My daughter was set to inherit millions, and now she will be receiving nothing. She is currently preparing for college, and now she's facing the reality that she'll have to take out loans and get a job. Even if I anticipated this response from them, I am still thoroughly sickened, and I have cut them off for once and all. One of the last messages they sent to me was ""\*We worked hard for our money and she won't be using it to fund her degenerate lifestyle\*"". This was the little girl whose hand they once held in the park, whose little body they once carried on their shoulders. I feel sick.

My daughter is inconsolable, but she has turned her anger against me. She is blaming me for this entire thing, and every day she alternates between raging and crying and raging again. Our home has become completely Inhospitable. Things have been broken, and my son and I are walking on eggshells. This whole time I have just been taking her shit, but last night we had another confrontation, and she screamed at me that this was all my fault, and that I just wanted her to live in a closet her entire life, and that I have never supported her, and this time I just snapped.

I yelled back that I had warned her, that I warned her and she chose not to listen. That her and her pack of stupid online friends, people who have never even met my parents, they all thought that they knew them better, and you decided to listen to them over than one person in this world who was actually raised by them. That I had advised her on the best investment she would ever make in her life, and she had blown it completely.

Since then she's been upstairs crying in her room, and I just don't know what to do. How in the hell am I supposed to navigate this situation? What could I have done to protect her from this? Am I really at fault here? What could I have done differently?

edit: I've received a lot of comments on this post and  gotten a lot of good advice, more than I possibly have the energy to reply to, but I'm reading every one. Thank you to everybody that commented so far. I also wanted to clear a few things up before I go because I just feel drained.

1. I never once told my daughter that she can't be gay in public. She can get six girlfriends and walk around with one on a lead for all I care, so long as it's all consensual and she doesn't end up on the local news. ​I only asked that she keep it off of social media, which her grandparents were a part of.
2. The reason my children's father​ isn't around is because he is dead. He was struck and killed by a drunk driver 10 years ago. I have never remarried.
3. I have already disowned my parents once and for all. Please stop telling me that I need to stand up to them and defend my daughter, I have already told them exactly what I think of them and they don't care.
4. My son will not be receiving my daughter's portion of the inheritance. That has apparently already been allocated to go towards outside groups of my parent's choosing. As for what types, you can use your imagination.
5. I do think that what my daughter did was foolish, unwise, and ultimately stupid in the context of the security of her future. An unpleasant part of parenthood that people rarely talking out is that sometimes your children will do and behave in ways that will make you dislike them. By lashing out, abusing her brother and I, and breaking things around the house, right now I do not like her. But I do love her, and that love is unconditional. I will never do to her what my parents did to me, and I will continue to support her through this, and maybe some way we can find a resolution.

I don't expect I'll update this post, by thanks again to everybody stopped by with advice and suggestions."

Hopefully I'll see some of you there.

HOLESOME CHRISTMAS SHIT: quick update on the post cause Christmas. We didn't do anything crazy today but we had a nice quiet day at home and she was quite visibly nervous as hell but really put herself out there for us. We managed to find some games and stuff that we could do including her and it was really fun. Also actually saw her enjoy eating for what seems like the first time so far. Not much to say from the top of my head but yeah, figured some would appreciate the quick para.

Alright, it's been a whole month since my first post and first up I'd just like to thank everyone who commented and helped with my issues/concerns/stupid shit. A bunch of people wanted the update and I'm all too happy to share because I feel like I'm doing a good job so far.
Now proceed to the stuff that actually matters to you:

For 1 month, I've learned quite a but about her because she's starting to open up and letting me ask questions. I've been noticing a gradual improvement in that so I guess I'm doing an alright job in being someone she can feel comfortable around. I still have moments where I notice she's uncomfortable or nervous/scared but we've got things to deal with that. I'd appreciate any further advice on how to be clear she doesn't have to do/say anything unless she wants to without outright saying it and embarrassing her.

We've come up with somewhat of a system, she's able to leave any situation if she needs to take a breather. My parents are getting along with her too, but she seems to be avoiding calling them mom and dad so far, but I guess I can understand that hesitation. They're trying not to push the relationship because they read something about kids feeling forced to like adoptive parents and not being able to disagree with things/object without fear of rejection. I've also told her that no matter what time or anything if she needs help for any reason that she can ask me, she is hesitant to ask sometimes but she is pretty good at things herself anyway so yeah.

Being perfectly honest it's really cool to see how she gets around the house and functions differently to me due to her sight. I occasionally ask questions but I'm still keeping that slow so she doesn't get annoyed. I remember a commenter on my last post mentioning a trick for not overfilling glasses by using your finger and I noticed she does it too, so I found that a little neat. I have had some great opportunities just to talk and try and get comfortable by going out to eat during the day sometimes and other random activities.

All in all I guess I'm still in the honeymoon period where I'm looking at everything positively but I'm enjoying it. There are some big changes in how things are working and I'm still adjusting to them but I'm eager to see how things keep going and hey, so far so good I guess.

I probably left stuff out so feel free to ask whatever in the comments as long as it doesn't require personal info."

I’m making a throwaway because there’s a reasonable chance that she’s on Reddit.
This situation has a few different factors which I’ll try and summarize quickly.

We’re both on the west coast. 

I’m a pretty stereotypical cis dude, though I’m not saying that anything I do is meant for cis dudes alone, because that’s ridiculous. I just fit a stereotype. I work as a carpenter. I like nascar. I lift weights. I don’t get astrology (more power to y’all, I just don’t really see it clicking for me). I like MMA. I have done a keg stand (poorly). My favourite movie is “Predator”. I love craft beer and I have, in the past, even caught myself wearing a beer t-shirt to social events. I have a beard and a digital watch.

I also have a “type”, and that type is REALLY tall women. My family is Dutch, I’m 6’8” and I like women to be over 6ft or so. It’s not a hard preference, but it’s a preference I have, which is how I met “Alice” (not her real name). 

Alice is fucking awesome. She also happens to be 6’4”. She’s part of our mutual friends group, which includes some people who aren’t straight and some people who are. A couple of times a month, we meet up at a friend’s place and hang out. So not only is she my type, she’s somebody that I see fairly often. 

A mutual friend of ours (I’ll call him “Dan”) basically set us up on a date, and we’ve had a few. We’ve kissed, but that’s about it, and I’m fine with that- no reason to not take things slow. We really do seem to have some chemistry. If I’m wrong about the chemistry, that’s fine. I am personally head-over-heels for this gal. We had been texting daily.

During our group meetup a couple of days ago, Alice asked me if I was straight or not. Without really thinking I was like “yeah, I’m pretty stereotypically straight”. I mean, I was wearing a beer t-shirt at that point. Alice seemed a bit sad about it, maybe uncomfortable, but I didn’t really pick up on it or why as I had already had a few beers. The night proceeded as normal, but she left early and we didn’t kiss or anything (which is fine, it wasn’t a date, I ain’t pushy). 

Since then, the texts- which were frequent before- have slowed down considerably, and Alice has been non-committal to dates. She says somethings up, but she’s not feeling like explaining it right away. It was a dramatic mood change. I asked Dan what was up, and we talked a bit. He said, “Y’all know she’s trans, right?” 

She’s what?

To make it clear, Dan is under the impression that the entire friends group knows except for me. Admittedly, I’m the newest member of the group. It’s apparently not a secret, but I really didn’t notice- I wasn’t looking either, but there’s clues, and I realize now that Alice was probably dropping hints. She legally changed her name when she was 19, I know that much. She’s not on speaking terms with one side of her religious family. She’s dealt with violence in the past with relationships, which is why she’s taking dating slow.

That last bit is what’s sticking with me. I am not positive, but I know that trans women have to deal with a metric fuckton of ridiculous bullshit and I can only guess that it might have occurred because she is trans. Even worse, it may have occurred due to somebody like me- some straight dude who might have found out that she was trans and reacted poorly. The question as to whether or not I was straight probably was meant to figure out if I was a candidate or not.

And I mean... Yeah, I’m straight. I go for women. Alice is a woman. I don’t really care about the details. I don’t care about what is, or what was, between her legs. I think she’s fucking awesome and I have absolutely caught feelings for her. Had I known that she was trans when she asked, I’d have said something like “yeah I go for people who identify as women” instead of “yeah I’m straight”. 

I want to tell her that I know and I don’t care, but I don’t want to invalidate her or reduce her to what she once presented as. I also really don’t want to scare her off or make her fear for her life, because I know she’s had to in the past and that’s horrible. I don’t want to accidentally say something that will fuck my chances either, because she’s great and I would really love to give this a chance.

I’m thinking of just sending her a message that tells her I heard and I don’t care, but that feels too impersonal. Dan has offered to tell her, but I’m not sure WHAT to tell her or how to word it. It feels like I’m invading her privacy to know. I don’t wanna bring up old memories of being attacked. I’m worried that I fucked up my chance somehow. 

Tl;dr: clueless straight dude has interest in a trans woman, and is worried sick about the right way to tell her that he knows and doesn’t give a fuck. Please help!

UPDATE: we talked. She asked Dan to bring it up to me. All is well! 

Update 2: this has blown up. I can’t respond to everybody, but I’ll get to a few. Thanks for the good wishes and I’m glad it’s brought smiles!

Final update before I go to bed: if this gets outta hand please lock it, mods 

IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING: yeah we’re official now. 

Re: those who say it’s fake because I like nascar and wear beer shirts: I’m from the South. "
ikhr8n,My [29f] boyfriend [25m] admitted that he forced himself on a woman several years ago.,6628,0.99,851,2020-09-01 15:52:27,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikhr8n/my_29f_boyfriend_25m_admitted_that_he_forced/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ikhr8n/my_29f_boyfriend_25m_admitted_that_he_forced/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"I'm going to preface this post with a disclaimer: it contains rape. If you find it distressing to read about this kind of topic, I urge you to stop reading now.

I have been with my boyfriend, Jason, for a year now. Jason is the first boyfriend I've had who puts real effort into truly listening to and understanding me. He can listen quietly as I describe a list of events from start to finish, while he only backchannels and then in the end expresses nothing but sympathy or helpful commentary. When I am facing a tough decision, he asks helpful questions which help guide me in the right direction. When I'm in trouble, without a second of thought he is the first person I call. He is a dream come true.

My parents love him.

My sisters love him.

My friends love him.

The *only* person who ever disliked him was a male friend of mine (completely platonic) who said he gave him the creeps. I have since fallen out with this male friend for tangentially related reasons. Also he was kind of a gigantic dickhead so I don't think he had any sixth sense. He just never had a nice thing to say about anyone but himself.

Anyway. Two nights ago, Jason and I were discussing our first real crushes. It was an innocent enough topic as, being completely devoted to each other, we have grown well past any jealousy issues in our relationship. I went first, talking about a boy I knew in college who ultimately broke my heart. When it was Jason's turn, I realized it wasn't a silly rom-com like mine. It was a fucking horror story.

He called it ""a dumb misunderstanding."" He described stealing a pair of her underwear.

He called it ""a drunken mistake."" He described pushing up against her and touching her butt without her consent at a party.

He called it ""one stupid night."" She was completely drunk in her bed. He climbed in. He took off her clothes. She was half asleep. He inserted himself inside of her. The way he tells it, it wasn't even sex. It was one person acting on a victim. His retelling of the events ends with her crying and kicking him out, never to talk again. I know he truly regrets it because by the end of his story he was full-on sobbing. He didn't deny a thing and said that yes, he had raped her, which led to him wanting to improve himself and learn how to respect women. He saw my reaction and asked if I thought he was a monster.

I told him I needed space and left. I didn't even pack anything; my sister picked me up and drove me to Rite Aid where I bought toiletries. My life has been torn apart because no matter how much I think it over, I have no desire to talk to him. Hearing his voice would probably give me a panic attack. In a true Jason fashion, he has given me all the space I need, not contacting me once. 

I've never been in a situation like this. The person I would normally turn to when my life was on the ropes just admitted he did something which, if convicted, would get him put in prison for several years. I can't talk to my sisters or family because if I do that they'll probably never let me within a mile of him again. 

Sorry, I think I'm just rambling now. I'm desperate for any ideas on how to proceed or even if my relationship can proceed at this point.

TL;DR: my boyfriend, a guy so great I thought we were bound for marriage, just admitted that he raped a woman several years ago. We are separated right now and I don't know what to do."
ak0oqn,Was my dad really grooming me or am I overreacting?,6618,0.92,552,2019-01-26 18:36:18,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ak0oqn/was_my_dad_really_grooming_me_or_am_i_overreacting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ak0oqn/was_my_dad_really_grooming_me_or_am_i_overreacting/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Hey reddit. I need your help! My (21F) father (61M) has had a very strange relationship with me my whole life. I don’t live with my family anymore due to university so this isn’t affecting me currently, but I am having a hard time processing it. I had another dream about it last night and I cannot bare to keep questioning these horrible thoughts anymore. Am I being stupid or is this serious?

There are little pieces of evidence that have amounted to me wondering if I had been treated wrongly by my dad. Weirdly, a lot of things don’t add up and I don’t want to accuse my father of anything in case I’m being over dramatic. But there have been occasions where I have known that my dad did things to me that weren’t necessarily normal but I didn’t say anything. 

My dad doesn’t really like my brother. At all. In fact he barely talks to him unless he’s getting in trouble. He loved me though. He absolutely adored me. And I adored him too. I never felt uneasy or unsafe around him. Even though he did some weird things to me. There was always something a little bit off. Even when I was little, I just had this weird gut feeling about his relationship with me. He isn’t my biological dad, my real dad ran away to New Zealand when he found out my mum was pregnant with me. That’s a whole other story, I have actually spoken to him since. He has three of his own kids now. 

My mum and “dad” met when my mum was trying to sell her house. I was only a baby at the time. One of the weird things about my relationship with my dad is that I have told lies to make him seem like he is my biological father. I don’t know why I do that. It’s not that I’m ashamed about him not being my real father. But I feel that maybe if I lied enough I would convince myself that he IS my real dad, and real dads don’t touch their real daughters in that way. 

I distinctly having a conversation with my mum about how mum and dad met. This was the first time my tummy ever churned in regards to my dad. She said at the time they met, she hadn’t washed in a few days, was struggling with post natal depression and was a single mother. She says she didn’t look good whatsoever. To the point where she was so shocked that my dad had asked her out on a date, she worried that it was because of me. My dad was a really good looking man. He was very successful with the ladies. I don’t know whether my mum was so insecure that she couldn’t believe he would ask her out, or if she has secretly had her own gut feelings. “What do you mean, to do with me?” I asked. I was about 13 or 14 at the time. “Well, I was worried that your dad might have been with me to get to you. Paedophiles come in all shapes and sizes.” I think I’ll remember her saying the word paedophile until the day I die. I felt so physically sick at her saying that but it is something I think about on a daily basis. 

That’s when a lot of things came flooding through into my memories. I never used to wipe after going for a pee. When I was about 8 years old I was in the bath and mum was watching me. We were discussing about toilet habits and I told her I didn’t wipe. “Why not?” She said. “It really hurts when I do” my mum looked alarmed. “What do you mean?” I shrugged it off “I don’t know, it just hurts when I touch down there.” I think my mum was concerned but I don’t think she ever found out a reason for it. But I do still remember it being tender when I tried to wipe. I can’t remember when it all started. When mum was away on nightshift, he would make me sleep in the bed with him. I honestly can’t say if anything happened. He would spoon me. But I don’t know if anything else occurred. When my mum was on nightshift, she would get home after my dad went to work, and while she was sleeping, I would take my brother and I out. We would “run away from home”. I was always such a well behaved girl. But my behaviour got so bad during that time that my mum broke down and told me she would put me in care because she couldn’t deal with me. I remember being the problem child very vividly. It’s one of the only parts of my childhood I remember. My mum had severe depression at that time too. She was actually put into counselling because I think she tried to take her life. Nobody has spoken about it but I do remember her having to get taken to this place. Which I later learned was a psychiatric hospital. I don’t remember any of the time she was away but obviously it was my dad looking after us. 

Fast forward a few years and I have began puberty. I was struggling with my body image like most girls were and I was very confused about everything. I was late getting my period, I was a late bloomer and was teased pretty badly at school by both girls and boys. I have vivid memories of my dad telling me that I have a lovely figure. He squeezed my boobs and my waist and my bum on multiple occasions. “You’re soft in all the places men love women to be soft in.” I was in my school uniform the majority of the time he did it. I looked him dead in the eyes as if to say “what the fuck are you doing?” But he always laughed. It really embarrassed me. And most of all I was uncomfortable when he did it. He was supposed to be the one keeping me safe and yet he was the one that made me feel the most humiliated. However, I never felt daunted if I had to spend time alone with him. I didn’t feel unsafe APART from when he did touch me. But I have read that one symptom of trauma is not remembering much of your childhood, and I really struggle to remember many memories of both childhood and high school. This could be a coincidence however. 

There were multiple instances where he would slap me on the bum, make me sit on his knee (as a 14/15 year old) and touch my thighs or my bum or my boobs. He would love giving me massages, and would take off my bra. I specifically remember one time I asked my mum if she could rub my back because it was really sore. I took off my bra and hit the ground as quickly as I could to avoid either of my parents seeing my boobs. My dad remarked “Christ, you have a big set of tits now”. In front of me and my mum. It embarrassed me so much. In a moment of anger I snapped at him “why the fuck were you even looking?” Why would your dad WANT to see your boobs?? My mum repeated what I said to him too, which surprised me. I assume she was taken aback by it. Nothing more was ever said. 

Throughout mostly my teenage hood my dad was very hands on with me. I noticed this when I realised that my friends dads weren’t nearly as touchy with their daughters. I thought my dad was just showing me affection. As teenagers do, I became aware of masturbating and it became a massive hobby for me. On multiple occasions, my dad walked in on me. And didn’t make any attempts to leave. There was a few times I near enough shat myself because I noticed him peering through the crack in the door. Out of panic, I pulled up my pants and ran over to the door and opened it. It was him stood there. “Yes?” Was all I managed to blubber out. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. I hadn’t heard him coming up the creeky stairs on any of the occasions. 

For some strange reason, and I really don’t know if this is paranoia or not, but I always felt overwhelmingly scared that come my 16th birthday he would try and take things further than just inappropriate touching. I have no idea why. Again I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I had a boyfriend at this point and dad then became very distant with me. I did however think it was strange that if I knocked on the bathroom door to tell him to let me know when he’s out the bath so I can brush my teeth, he would tell me to come in anyway. And he would be there, naked, in the bath. Not trying to hide anything. I don’t know if that’s normal or not in a household? Throughout this time he did keep touching me inappropriately but again I didn’t feel scared in his presence APART from when he did touch me on the odd occasion. 

I think the biggest situation that sticks out in my mind was when I had broken up with my boyfriend and was about to begin university. I asked my dad if he could crack my back as he was the heaviest in my family and always managed to. Mum and my brother we’re both in bed. He then asked, “do you want me to give you a massage” I shrugged and said alright. I took off my top and he did my back for a while. Nothing weird happened. But then he took off my pyjama bottoms and my pants without even asking. He started rubbing my bum cheeks and my thighs as I laid there in shocked silence. He then proceeded to rub my vagina from behind and my bum hole. At one point he spread apart my bum cheeks to, I suppose “inspect” my “area”. I was absolutely mortified. He did this for about 10 minutes or so. That was the only hard evidence I have for him properly inappropriately touching me. I thought this was going to be the time he raped me. I thought all those years of being scared about turning 16 were finally rational, as horrible as it sounds. I was now 17 but had been with my boyfriend since before I was 16. So my dad hadnt been as full on with the touching. I laid completely still. I didn’t tell him to stop. I was so embarrassed. But at the same time I didn’t want to embarrass him by telling him it was wrong. So I just let him and hoped nothing would progress. It was the most uncomfortable and ashamed I had ever felt in my life at that point. The only time he spoke to me was to say “you’re very hairy aren’t you” which added to the awkward and embarrassing situation. I never ever told anyone about it. 

I didn’t tell a soul about my fathers actions towards me the whole time it happened. I continue and have since the age of about 12 had dreams about my father having sex with me. In all of the dreams, I enjoy it and want it. This confuses me even greater. I feel extremely lost and embarrassed and so utterly ashamed of myself. I’m scared that I’m overreacting with this. I don’t want to accuse him of anything. I love my dad but it’s no doubt that he is mentally ill. I am not angry at him, I actually feel very sorry for him. This is more for my peace of mind. I just don’t want to be confused anymore. And I keep dreaming about it and it’s terrifying me that it is a reality.  If anyone would be able to make sense of all this I would be eternally grateful. Thank you so much for listening, it’s taken great courage. 

Edit: I cannot thank everyone enough for their kind words. It was extremely hard to write but whilst writing I was actually able to process a lot of it. I am in the process of replying to everyone who has sent me messages, I didn’t expect this to blow up at all. When I began receiving the first couple of replies I did have a big cry. I was hoping to myself I was being extremely stupid and I had been overthinking about it all. First thing on Monday, I am ringing a counsellor. That is for certain. I am extremely wary about telling my mum but I’m going to see how I get on with therapy. I know it’s the right thing to do, but part of me is thinking that ignorance is bliss. I dont want to tear my family apart. These feelings may change if/when I begin to open up. I’m extremely lucky that I have a loving and understanding boyfriend who unfortunately has also suffered from child abuse. He has had therapy for his and is urging me to do the same (for my diagnosed depression- it’s probably linked to all of this tbh). He’s the first person I’m going to tell in person. I actually wanted to tell him but I thought a reddit opinion would either tell me to cop on or realise that it was as serious as my gut feeling told me. Unfortunately it was the latter. If this has taught me anything, it’s that yeah there are horrible cruel people, but you strangers have shown me kindness. I can’t thank you all enough <3"
9o7vye,My(28m) girlfriend(29f) said another mans name during an intimate moment,6593,0.96,896,2018-10-15 05:58:03,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9o7vye/my28m_girlfriend29f_said_another_mans_name_during/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9o7vye/my28m_girlfriend29f_said_another_mans_name_during/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"We’ve been together 7 years with a couple of short breaks during that time. Over the past few months I’ve been getting a nagging feeling that something is not quite right with the relationship, as I’ve been trying to plan short trips or holidays all of which have been declined with the same response that she cannot afford any time off work. She is also very quick to close any messages on her phone if I enter the room.

This evening during an intimate moment she said the name of one of her male co-workers I confronted her on this and she flatly denied saying anything at all, but I have no doubts over what I heard. 

I took her home in what felt like the longest drive of my life. As I dropped her off I said I wanted to talk about what happened she just left without saying a word.

This all happened just a few hours ago and I’m struggling to comprehend exactly what’s gone on.

EDIT: had a rather restless night and what I imagine will feel like a pretty long day at work is ahead of me. There seems to be a consensus on that enough of my time and energy has been wasted on this relationship and it’s time to cut my losses.

EDIT2: Back from work and mentally preparing myself for whats about to come. Thank you all to everyone who has shared their comments.

UPDATE: She has completely ghosted me and all I am left with is unanswered questions. All I could do is leave her a message saying it was over and then sit in my flat entirely alone with no response. 7 years ago we had a great relationship then a good relationship then an ok relationship until we had a shitty relationship but it happened so gradually it is difficult to see what exactly went wrong until it felt like it was easier to put up with it than letting go. I don’t know what happened and I’m not sure I ever will truly know. I spent a quarter of my life in this relationship and now all I can do is wonder what else I could have done with that time."
8sx160,An Update from JasonInHell,6582,1.0,209,2018-06-22 06:03:19,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8sx160/an_update_from_jasoninhell/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8sx160/an_update_from_jasoninhell/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,,False,"**tl;dr** - I am doing better and I continue to get better everyday

The first thing you may notice is this is being posted from a different account, I deleted the /u/jasoninhell account in a knee jerk reaction to seeing my reddit posts in the news.

I guess the first question to answer is how am I doing, and to that I would say I am doing well. I have bad days but I would think that is to be expected. It is just important that I, or anyone going through something, continue to use the support of friends and family as well as good coping skills to not let myself be completely defeated on those bad days. I won't lie, I struggled to get back to where I am. For some time I refused to sleep because of combination of fear of what I would wake up to and nightmares about that night. For a time I used alcohol to sleep but my family loved me enough to take it from me before it became a damaging and permanent habit. I was hospitalized because I did have thoughts of ending my life because I missed my children so much. From that I learned that you should never be ashamed of your mental health and not seeking treatment will only make it worse, not better. We have all heard it but if you or a loved one is struggling seek immediate assistance, your life is too important to throw away in a moment of weakness. By putting off treatment I only caused everything else in my life to suffer. I lost my job and became reclusive to the house. But don't worry I have been back to work since December and I have nearly regained my former position and salary, so I am good and require no assistance.

The second question would be how do I feel about the sentencing. That is something that is harder to answer, because no matter what the sentence nothing will bring back my beloved children. Do I think she should have gotten the death penalty (which Indiana has), no I do not. She wanted to die and after 9 years of giving her what she wanted when she wanted it I was not going to give her another thing. Do I think the life sentence will have any appreciable effect on her? I don't know, one thing she always stressed for the entire time that I knew her was that she lived her life without any regrets. Even after I caught her cheating on me she continued to say she had no regrets.

As for the ex-in-laws, they continue to be a problem to this day. Shortly after everything happened they changed the locks on the home I was renting from them with my property still inside. After trying to civilly negotiate the return of the property it was required that I involve law enforcement. That is an ongoing legal battle. A member of the family accused me of stealing property I had purchased from them prior to the death of the children and threatened to take action against me unless I paid double what I had already paid them. I alerted the authorities and as far as I know that is resolved. They continue to make visiting my children's grave difficult, during the one year anniversary they sat in their truck and just watched me the whole time I was visiting the grave. Because of that I don't visit the grave as often as I would like to.

If I can impart on you something I have learned through all of this it is that you should always take the time to be with the ones you love. It doesn't matter if they are asking you to read The Poky Little Puppy for the millionth time or asking you to play Smash Bros even though you both know they will wipe the floor with you every time, just do it because you never know what time will be the last time. Always make sure they know how much you love them, I had the fortune that the last thing my children ever heard me say was, ""I love you, good night. I will see you in the morning"""

I've always liked gay porn, I watch gay porn exclusively. I go to pornhub and start browsing. I'll try to not make this as graphic as it could be, but I clicked on a random video and it was definitely my husband. His face was fully visible, several unique tattoos. It was him. I knew  without a shadow of a doubt this took place after we were married because he had the goddamn ring on!

I was furious and disgusted. He had unprotected sex with multiple men. All I could think of was STDs. I didn't sleep last night. I called off from work, too. First thing I went to a free clinic to get checked. I haven't been home since. I don't think I can fucking look at him. I'm so fucking angry. 

What do I do?

TLDR Saw husband with multiple men in gay porn that definitely took place after we were in a committed relationship. Would it be gauche to ghost my husband at this point?

UPDATE: I spoke to him. He said he has a meth problem and that it ""turns him gay"". This has been going on for months. He meets randoms off Grinder. This was not an isolated event. I'm devestated. He said he'd go to rehab. I told him we're wayyy past all of that and that I wanted a divorce. He said he'd do whatever as long as I didn't tell anyone because fuck our marriage, fuck the life we have, who cares about that! It's all about his image. I'm just collateral! Yo, I don't give a fuck, I'll send screengrabs to his boss, to his mom, to every one. Fuck you, Brandon.

9q34aw,I found my husbands secret Reddit account where he has PMed girls from gone wild... I feel like this is cheating?

I’m sorry if I make any mistakes. 

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1, friends for 14 (we met in high school.). We were out at an event on Friday night and my phone died while he was busy for two hours so I started browsing Reddit using his phone. My thumb print is programmed into his phone and it isn’t unusual for us to use each others phones. 

When I opened his app the entire front page was filled with nsfw content/subs so I looked at the profiles and saw that he was logged into a secondary account used only for porn. I have no problem with porn - in fact we frequently watch it together. I saw his user name and scrolled through a page of comments when he came over to check on me. I quickly closed the app and when I saw him - I’m not sure why.. I think I felt so shocked I didn’t want to tell him I’d seen? 

He took his phone from me and while he had it he logged out of that account and gave me back his phone. 

Later that night from my own Reddit account I searched his user name and found hundreds of messages on gonewild subs but also subs for specific girls. His comments were mostly compliments to body types that don’t really match with mine. A few girls had posted fantasies about making videos with men while they do xyz or exchanging Snapchat videos. He posted “I’ve PMed you”. One of those posts was just before our wedding. 

Four years ago he posted on an askreddit thread titled “Reddit have you ever met a psychopath?”  He commented “I may be dating one now. Wait a couple months and I’ll let you know” we had been together two years at that point. But I don’t know context - if we’d had a fight or what?

He had an important work event tonight that he was really stressed about so I haven’t brought it up yet. I feel sick to my stomach and I haven’t slept at all. We’ve been trying to have a baby and I just can’t imagine continuing to sleep with him when I’m feeling so undesirable. 

Am I overreacting? Is this cheating? How do I talk to him about this? I’ve never felt worse about myself or my body. 

TL;DR - without intending to snoop I stumbled upon my husbands porn Reddit account and he’s been messaging people in a way that feels like cheating to me. "
16h6ctz,I (34 F) was stabbed and now my soon-to-be ex-husband (34 M) wants to cancel the divorce,6528,0.98,381,2023-09-13 04:41:09,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16h6ctz/i_34_f_was_stabbed_and_now_my_soontobe_exhusband/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16h6ctz/i_34_f_was_stabbed_and_now_my_soontobe_exhusband/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"My soon-to-be ex-husband and I had been married for 12 years.  We got married at 22.

About 4 months ago he asked me for a divorce after confessing to me that he was having an affair and that he was in love with that person.  At first I took it badly but I have always said that if there is a third person in a relationship, someone is left out.  I also didn't want to waste my energy begging for something I know won't come back.

His mother got sick and I had to take care of her at night since the lady is quite picky with other people.  She always treated me badly but I still took care of her.  This delayed the divorce a bit, I guess they were using me as a nurse or babysitter lol.

A month and a half ago I was assaulted when I was going to work (I don't have a car, my husband always drove me but he stopped after filing for divorce), I didn't have much with me, just my cell phone and about 10 dollars, so I was stabbed for not carrying much in your pockets (LATAM moment).

My emergency contact was my husband and the whole thing.  He now doesn't want a divorce since he says that ""this altercation opened his eyes and that he really can't imagine a life without me.""

It was going to be an uncontested divorce since this type of divorce is totally free in my country and I'm stingy enough to not want to pay a lawyer's fees, but now he doesn't want a divorce.

I'm living with my mother and my soon-to-be ex-husband comes every day to screw up my existence.

What do I do to get rid of it?  I already made it clear to him that I don't want anything from him.  Besides, I already hired a lawyer to advise me but he says it's taking too long because he doesn't want a divorce."
fw7109,"Ex fiancee [32F] of 8+ years broke up with me [32M] via text message ~3 years ago, and disappeared. Now is trying to rejoin our circle of mutual friends, and i am struggling with it extremely hard.",6519,0.99,426,2020-04-07 02:35:53,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fw7109/ex_fiancee_32f_of_8_years_broke_up_with_me_32m/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fw7109/ex_fiancee_32f_of_8_years_broke_up_with_me_32m/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Me and a girl who i will just call Jessica, were a couple for 8+ years and engaged for 3+ of them. I met her through a mutual friend in my group of friends. We ended up hitting it off pretty quickly as our dorky/nerdy hobbies aligned really well. I personally fully expected to marry this person, and spend the rest of my life with her.

In early 2016 her job offered her an amazing opportunity to temporarily work 4 months in the companies satellite office New Zealand (she was an Environmental Engineer), to temporarily manage and lead a new team. It was very sudden, and i was not really happy with the idea, but she really wanted this chance and opportunity. So off she went.

I flew out to visit her after ~2 months, only when i arrived at the airport i got a text message from her. The message was short and more or less consisted of ""she was sorry but after thinking it through, she thinks it would be best if we went our separate ways from now on"". She then completely blocked me on almost every single form of social media, cell phone, etc. I was confused, devastated and became an absolute wreck. 

I remember completely breaking down in Auckland Airport. I spent the next 4 days living at a motel basically trying to get into contact with her in any shape or form. She had apparently blocked everyone of our circle of friends. Even her close friends from our circle of friends were shocked, confused and basically lost. Even her parents were extremely confused when i called them, her dad who i was extremely close with (we coached pee-wee hockey together, and played a lot of beer league for hockey together), refused to believe it at first. 

I was a mess for a solid year, but my close circle of friends managed to drag me out of my hellish hole along with some therapy. Her best friends became close friends to me. About a year ago, she invited some of her old close friends to her wedding among a bunch of other people from our group. No one went, and i quickly found out which hurt me even more.

Over a year ago i started dating one of her old friends, as me and her had gotten close over the last 2 years or so. She felt quite hurt when Jessica basically ghosted her. Unfortunately there was some awkwardness because she fully knew i was not fully over my ex, but she has been a supportive and amazing person and i am extremely happy with her. Life was going great for me. 

Then in December Jessica apparently moved back home after divorcing a few months after getting married. I don't know much and i don't want to know. However she is making this hugely concentrated effort to reconnect with people in our friend group, which is resulting in some very conflicted feelings for some people.

Last week i found out that Jessica and some of my friends have started playing D&D (via roll20), which frankly made me feel like shit. Part of my just wants to move on from this but i am struggling hard. While my SO has been extremely supportive, i just feel numb and dont really know what to do.

Today Jessica sent me a long facebook message basically apologizing to me for what she did, and asked to be friends. I didn't respond and blocked her. I told my SO, and i just felt like i was going to break down. Right now my SO is saying she is worried about me, and keeps asking me what do i want to do. My SO confessed that Jessica had sent her a similar message a few weeks ago, and she told her off.

I don't know what i am supposed to do, i can't order my friends to not be friends with her. I just feel like a mess and i am struggling with this as i feel like i am teenager dealing with stupid drama again. 

TLDR; EX Fiancee of 8+ years dumped me via text message after i flew across the world to see her. Now she is trying to reconnect with everyone and i am struggling very hard with this. What should i do?"
c2xkpx,UPDATE 2: Just found out my husband (28M) invited another woman over to spend the night while I’m (24F) away on business.

I haven’t been able to respond to everyone, and I’m still working through all the comments, but the advice, stories, and love you’ve shared has been overwhelming and absolutely needed. Thank you. Even the people calling me names and calling me out for not being stronger - thank you.

It hurt to come to the realization that we can’t move forward from this. He’s betrayed my trust so many times that I’d need him to verify pretty much anything for awhile, and that’s no way for either of us to live. 

The fact of the matter is that we’re both pretty broken, and have no business being in a relationship with each other, or anyone else right now. I truly don’t believe he’s a terrible person, but he has been a terrible partner. Like many of you said, he can be a good person and not be good for me. 

Last night, I chickened out. I was so scared of losing him forever that I said we should just take a break, have him fly home, and work on ourselves for a bit. There were a lot of tears, but when the conversation was over, I didn’t feel better, just... stuck. 

This morning, I realized what I’d done. I did this the last time I tried to get out of an abusive relationship, and put up safeguards so I could feel comfortable leaving. My husband doesn’t deserve to be led on, and I don’t deserve to be unable to move on. I read through more of your messages, and I can’t thank you all enough for your words of comfort, encouragement, and strength. 

The thing is, for you it’s black and white. For me, my thoughts are so thoroughly clouded by emotions and history, and I have to let that all go. The best thing I can do for both of us is to give up. 

So this morning, I did. I told him that while we could take a break and try again, it would never work. I can never truly trust him again, and he wants me to change things about myself that are things I love and have no desire to change. We’ve been trying so hard for so long to make things work that we’re just too far gone. 

There were lots of tears, but he took it well. He’s agreed to a no-contest divorce, and we’ll spend the next few days packing up our house before the lease is up at the end of the month. Some of you may come at me with pitch forks for not screwing him over, or breaking up last night, or leaving him to deal with the house alone, but that’s okay. I’ll be staying at my friend’s house until my new apartment is ready, and really focusing on just working on myself. I won’t help him pack unless I have someone with me. Much of the stuff is mine anyway, and I’d rather not leave it behind. You guys are right that my self-confidence has taken a nose dive lately. I have a lot of healing to do before I’m ready to consider love again, and I have two appointments scheduled with my therapist this week. This man is not a monster in my book, he’s a little boy that needs to grow up. We both made our fair share of mistakes in this relationship, but rather than feeling sorry for myself, I’m choosing to take those lessons and move on. I’m the kind of person who is very good at bouncing back, it’s just the getting out that’s hard. Thank you all for your help in that. I wish him all the best, and simply have no desire to harbor hate in my heart. 

**Because I know how easy it is for manipulated, abused women to go right back, I’ve talked a lot with my family and close friends over the last 48 hours. I previously didn’t share a lot of what was happening with them because I was embarrassed. Everyone always said we were  the perfect couple, and I was so ashamed of all the problems we had. I’ve informed these people that they are not to let me go back, should it come to that, in no uncertain terms. I don’t think I’ll get to that point, but I just want to be sure.

Edit: As a side note, I shared it for me, because damn I needed the loving slap in the face that this sub so gracefully provides. But I also shared it because I hope that anyone else who reads my story and sees parallels in their own life will have the strength and courage to put themselves first. If you’re feeling like you need to get out, but don’t feel strong enough, or like it’s bad enough, or like you’ll make it to the other side, feel free to message me. We’re in this together. ❤️"
8bjgbb,My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea,6471,0.97,1989,2018-04-12 00:07:40,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8bjgbb/my_wife_named_our_son_after_her_first_love_and_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8bjgbb/my_wife_named_our_son_after_her_first_love_and_i/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"This is my throwaway account because she know my main account. My son is 5. About 2 days ago we were out shopping and ran into a high school friend of hers. She was catching up when she told her friend that we had a son. When the old friend asked his name my wife hesitated and I told her. She had a strange look on her face then said you mean like your ex boyfriend. Our sons name is very unique to the point that I've never met another person with the same name. Now she refuses to talk to me about it. I feel betrayed and disgusted with her. It's like a switch was flipped my mind and I just can't look at her the same way. 











Update 1. Lots of questions so I'll go ahead and answer a few that have been mentioned a few times. I'm not giving out my son's name. When we discussed the name I had no idea it was her high school ex's name. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who's name was never told to me and their relationship lasted around two years. I'm upset but that doesn't automatically make make me abusive. I would never raise my hand to my wife or anyone else I care about. I will always love my son and I would never and I mean never treat him any differently. I will post an update when I talk to her probably in a day or two




Update 2. So to get some things out of the way first. The kid is mine. I have very pronounced features that he also has plus her ex was black and I'm white. I'm not  going to ""throw him away"" as so many comments suggested. When we were deciding on the name she said she remembered somebody from school who had it and instantly loved it. My wife and I both had a very promiscuous past before we met and agreed that the past should stay there so I didn't push to hard to know certain details. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who cheated on her but I never asked his name and that is my fault.

So update time. Thursday we didn't have the discussion because that is her late day at work plus this wasn't a discussion I wanted to have with our son in the house. So Thursday night when she came in I told her that Friday after work we needed to sit down and talk and if she has any plans she need to cancel. She looked very worried and said ok. Friday came and we sit down after her sister came to pick up our son for a sleep over. I asked why would not tell me where our name came from? She said she was sorry but she didn't think it was that big of a deal and I would not agree to it. I told her that it was my choice too and she took that away from me. I asked her if she would feel the same way if we had a daughter and named her after one of my ex's and she said that's different I wouldn't let that happen. She said that she knows she can disconnect the name from her ex but she wouldn't be sure I could do the same. I was floored and starting to feel sicker than I had felt. I told her that is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard come out of someone's mouth. I moved on because I had more questions and I was about to go off just on what she just said. I asked her if she still loved him and she paused for a minute then said yes but not in same way she loves me and that you don't just stop loving someone that love changes. I wanted to throw up at this point. She could see that I was very upset. She smiled at me and said I should know she only wants to be with me. I said that I needed to know how you love him. At that point she put her hand on my leg and tried to change the subject. I told her to take her fucking hand off me right now and answer the question. Her mood changed right there from wanting to move past this to no he didn't just fucking cuss at me. She said look you're upset and I get that but what is done is done so you need to get over this and move on. She got up and said I'm meeting my mom dinner I'll see you when you get home. I told her if you walk out that door then no you won't. She looked at me like I was full of shit grabbed her purse and left. I packed my bag and stayed at a friend's house last night. Right now I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what to do next.

We both work in creative industries and tend to work on short term contracts, as well as bartending on the weekends to keep money consistent. We’ve been living together for almost 2 years. He’s left before to visit family, but this time, I was excited for him to leave. Usually I feel bad when he goes because I feel like I’ll miss him.

Last year he had a really stressful contract. During that time I picked up some extra household chores, and since then we’ve argued about them. I didn’t mind doing them throughout the project, but we already have difficulty dividing household chores. I take a long time to do them, and I can’t tell if it’s because I’m a perfectionist who cleans every inch of something once I start, or if it’s because I’m not getting as much help as I’m being told I am… 

I feel like I’ve always been calling out for help. I ask for us to do it, and I get an attitude, a list of other things he has to do like work (when we work the same jobs) and a time limit. It’s not a set time limit, but his helpfulness has a battery and it gets low quickly. Even when he does a task, it’s also done slow AND it’s half-assed. I have to go in and tweak the work he does- we don’t have the same definition of clean. His is that every thing LOOKS clean- and mine is that every inch -even the ones we don’t see - should be done. We live in a historic building and I’m not risking bugs. Sorry. We made slight peace with it before he left… slight. 

Then he actually left. 

I danced in the living room. I sang in the kitchen. I finished a project- I cooked myself a friggin awesome dinner. I tidied up all of my spaces to enjoy. I went to work. I came home. It was still CLEAN and I danced and sang all over again. I woke up the next day and to make a long story short- lived my best life. I’m having a BLAST. 

Then he called me to tell me how much he missed me… and I felt so weird. I’m not painting him in the best light in this story but he truly is my best friend. My heart. My boobear. It’s not that I don’t want to be with him, I am just enjoying my own company so much that I didn’t miss him. He is so kind and loving and I love him but not being able to reciprocate that feeling left me feeling weird. And then a little resentful about the cleaning stuff. 

I don’t want to have more fun without him. I don’t want to feel relieved when he leaves because it means I’ll actually get something done. 

Is this fixable?? It’s been on and off for two years this cleaning thing. But me not missing him when he’s gone…? 

I’m scared."
17dcowv,Update: My (36F) daughter's (18F) friend (18F) stole a $4900 watch from my husband (56M) and we don't know how to tell her parents,6469,0.97,349,2023-10-22 02:47:39,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17dcowv/update_my_36f_daughters_18f_friend_18f_stole_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17dcowv/update_my_36f_daughters_18f_friend_18f_stole_a/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[first post 
](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/IshkbP4KBN)

My (36F) husband (56M) and I decided to talk to her (18F) parents (40s) because she lives with them and we thought telling them was the best thing. Well, according to them, they suspected that she was doing something wrong because she was ""receiving"" more and more gifts from my daughter every day, because that's what she said they were. We told them that our daughter only gave her a bracelet that was a birthday gift but that the rest of the things were never ""gifted"", and fortunately they weren't offended and even promised to check her room to see if they could find our things.

When they checked  her room and her electronics they found even more things than we thought. She has been stealing things from our house for months to sell them online on a second-hand clothing sales app. At home we live with four teenagers (18 16 14 12) who are constantly exchanging clothes, shoes and jewelry and often have arguments because one of them takes something from the other without permission, so when she stole several of my daughters' clothes they never suspected it was her. She sold all the clothes she stole from them and only had my daughter's earrings and necklace, a ring from my youngest daughter (8) and my husband's watch in her house. 

According to her, she did that because she wanted to help her father with some debts that he has because she didn't want to have to sacrifice college to reduce expenses. She works as a nanny and sometimes that money wasn't enough to help her family and she noticed that since my daughter ""wasn't affected"" by losing jewelry, so she thought about taking them because she needed them more. Her parents confirmed that they have a debt but they would never have thought she would do something like this to help. They apologized and promised to return every penny of the things that were already sold but my husband told them that it was not necessary, that her giving us back the jewelry and the watch was enough. She gave us everything back and also apologized, and we told her that this time we were not going to involve the police but that not everyone would do the same if they caught her stealing again. We also made it clear to her that she's no longer welcome in our home and that my daughter will finish the project for both of them because we don't want her to be involved with her either. And that was it and we haven't heard from her since.

A lot of people said we were idiots for not getting the police involved and the truth is we might be, but we weren't going to ruin an entire family's life over a watch and some earrings. I also read comments saying that my daughter knew that she stole but that is not the case. She loses things all the time or sometimes her sisters take her things without permission so she never suspected that her friend was the one stealing from her, that's why she kept inviting her over."
1d4tnre,Husband M34 Wants Permission to Use and Egg Donor Outside of Our F33 Marriage Because of Race.

We met again abroad where we both studied and worked and met for lunch years later and then started dating. We have been together for 5 years, 2 years married. We decided to move back to our home (where we are both from) country once I found out I was pregnant. 

I am an international adoptee from South Asia. We're both citizens of Northern Europe. My husband is white with blond hair and blue eyes I have South Asian features.

Our child was born two years ago. 

The twist: 

So my husband told me on NYE that he doesn't feel a connection to our child at all. I asked him how and why and he complained it was because of her appearance. That she has more dominant features from me (i.e dark eyes and darker hair). I swear every single friend/family member from my side has said our child looks exactly like my husband. She even has very light brown hair (not that it matters to me), but just brown eyes. 

He told me that he wants a family member that looks like him with blonde hair and blue eyes. I asked him if he was open to adoption (because I am) he said no he wants to see his own 'features' in the child. We went back and fourth until he told me he wants to use an egg donor to conceive blond hair blue eyes and his 'genes'. 

My first reaction was WTF. I told him that's really insulting and how the hell can he say that about his own child and why didn't he think about this earlier before he married and had kids with me. I just bluntly told him we've all seen the eye charts in biology class in school, usually brown eyes dominate. Why did he spew this all out now 1.5 years after the birth of our child? 

We've been going back and fourth in arguments and he always brings this topic in an argument and give me the ultimatum of divorcing or accepting him to proceed with the white egg donor/surrogate. 

I have tried hashing this out in therapy with an open mind because I have genuine questions: 

How do you think our current child would feel about the truth? 

How do you think the new egg donor child would feel about the truth?

What do you think others will say about this?

I have discovered that many of these opinions have been formed from comments from friends/family members that have received our child as an 'immigrant'. My questions is: what's wrong with that, and what does it even matter? 

He also said that he would like the egg donor child do have personality trait similar to him. i.e analytical, quiet, nature-lover etc. I personally don't think you can dictate/impact another human's personality. Moreover, It's not a great reason to have children. 

I have told both his parents and they've tried to talk to him. He is very adamant that this child will be the answer to his negative feelings about his family. 

My opinion: 

It's very insulting. If he's got microagressions he wants to discuss, why hasn't he come to me? I'd hope that the one person who accepts me as myself in my adoptive country would be my husband. But frankly it does not feel like the case here. I feel like the conflict of 'being foreign' is being passed on to my child now, and sadly by the other person who should love and accept her the most; the other parent. 

I personally have tried to be open to the thought, but just the principle of reasons why he wants to go ahead with this are incredibly shallow, superficial and racist. 

I'm at the point of considering filing for divorce. It's not going anywhere. 

Curious to hear your perspectives.

We had tickets to see a show last night, but after a long day of drinking in the heat, I wasn't feeling well and needed to end the night early. I encouraged my husband to still go so he could enjoy his evening, so he did and I went to sleep.

2AM rolls around and I wake up to find that he never came back to the room - the show is literally at our hotel so I start to panic. I go to check his location, it's off. Then I text him asking where he was, he reads it and doesn't respond. I call him several times and he sends me to voicemail. While I was trying to get ahold of him, I see there were 2 separate charges for $1,000+ from a strip club. He didn't respond to me till nearly 3AM and just texted he was on his way back.

30 minutes later, he stumbles in the room absolutely obliterated. He tries to lie and say he was just gambling down the strip, that he never went to the strip club even though the charges were literally made with ApplePay and he hadn't lost his phone.

After going through his receipts, I found he'd been at the strip club for nearly 5 hours, essen confirming that he went straight from the show and left 40 minutes after my first ""where are you?"" text.

I also checked all of our accounts, and if all the charges made settle as they are, he'll have spent nearly $6,000 there. He swears he ""didn't cheat"" on me and says nothing sexual happened, though I can only imagine the situations you find yourself in after 5 hours in a strip club, especially when you're intoxicated beyond comprehension. I feel like I'll never truly know what happened and that alone is the most painful part.

We flew home a day early, and I just have no idea where to go from here. We've been together for 7 years, married for 4 years in just a couple months.

As far as I was aware, we're in a great place in our marriage, and there haven't been any issues with infidelity in the past. This is completely out of character - I'm absolutely crushed and deeply disappointed. He was reckless with our money, with my trust, with our marriage and it really fucking hurts. The fact we were on a solo trip together and instead of coming back to me, or doing literally anything else, he chose to go to a strip club.

I would love any insight + advice from those who've gone through something similar with their partners. Thank you for reading. 💛"
boj8kp,[UPDATE] I (19F) have a date (19F) tonight. She's *visually impaired.

&#x200B;

I wanted to wait a few days before I updated you guys, just because it was a first date and we didn't know each other previously. I wanted her to still be talking to me for a few days afterwards.

&#x200B;

So, I picked her up from her house and I was in awe of how beautiful she looked. She got in and we figured out where to get fro yo, and when we got to the store, she asked me to read all the flavors to her. Of course, I did, then grabbed us some sample cups. She got pistachio, lavender blueberry, and either vanilla or classic tart. She left the last one a secret to me. I got classic tart and the lavender blueberry with some blueberries on top. We started the conversation on our frozen creations and delved into deeper conversation. Unfortunately, there were some loud little kids so we could barely hear each other, but we still enjoyed each other's company.  We got back in the car, and I went to drop her off, and she invited me in to watch a movie! She wanted to spend more time with me, yes!! She handed me the remote and said to pick whatever, so I picked one of my favorite scary movies, and started it. During the opening scene she brought up the fact if I've ever been around someone who couldn't see. I told her no, and we kinda got back into the movie, bringing up odd conversation here and there. After the movie, I went home, pretty giddy from the experience.

&#x200B;

We're still talking, thankfully, and we're planning on when to meet up next. She's just sick right now, so it's hard to plan around that. I'm excited for our next date!

\*changed title to fit her disability

TLDR; The date went amazingly and we're planning for date #2 and I really had nothing to worry about in the end.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I see a lot of people mentioning my boyfriend, which yes I do have. We're in an open relationship and he wants me to explore my sexuality before we settle down, and my date was aware of our situation. We've had a lot of talks and conversations since. Maybe I should update the post I made about him?"

When we visited them we went out and explored the city during the day and pretty much fended for ourselves. We’re very clean, take care of dishes, and overall we’re pretty quiet and respectful of others’ homes.

Here’s where it starts: they asked what we were doing for Christmas and we didn’t have any plans so we gave them the dates they could possibly come visit us. This is where we should have clarified that they could stay 3-4 days and not the entire length of time we were available—my partner and I still wanted a relaxing winter break before we have to resume work.

We asked several times what their plans were or if they knew the dates...they told us the day before they arrived they would be there tomorrow with no end date in sight. We now have an end date but they are staying for a total of 8 days, with a 7-month-old baby.

We thought, woah, way more than we offered but okay we can do this. We also just moved into our apartment 3 weeks ago and nothing is baby-proof - we let them know this (tile floors, glass table) and yet they were upset when we didn’t have a bucket to clean her nappies/diapers in, no baby aspirin, and no high chair. Mind you, we don’t have kids. 

It’s only been 24 hours and here are the other grievances we have:
-Piss all over the side of the toilet/floor
-Blew up the toilet and don’t clean up the poop skids (there is a toilet brush and cleaner to the side of toilet...where said piss was)
-Blasting the TV after we’ve tried to go to sleep
-We paid for all of the food to cook for Christmas meals
-Moved some of our furniture and completely rearranged our fridge
-Tracked dirt all over apartment with pram/stroller
-Overall, messy and literally their stuff is all over the apartment 
-They fight a lot with each other (we witnessed this in their home, just verbal bickering but a lot) so I shouldn’t be surprised they’re doing it in our place. But I am.

Basically we want to know what is the best way to resolve this so we can still have a nice winter break before we go back to work without causing too much friction but also letting the couple know there’s been a violation of expectations."

My best friend, “Pam” and my brother, “Jim” got married 2 years ago. I recently discovered that Jim is cheating on Pam with a college friend of mine. Said friend posted a picture of my brothers back laying in bed with her on her snapchat. I’m assuming most people thought it was some random guy but Jim has a tattoo of my and my younger sisters names on his left shoulder.

I immediately confronted him and demanded an explanation and he admitted he has been having an affair for the last 2 months. I was appalled but decided to not tell due to Jim’s pleading. I’ve been having a very hard time choosing to stay quiet or not.  

I didn’t have a great childhood, my dad was out of the picture, mom was there but had some mental health issues that’d render her, lets just say unable to be fully attentive. Jim stepped up. He served as a parent for so much of my life. He practically raised me and my sister. If not for him being in my life, honestly I probably would’ve starved to death, or ended up on the streets. I don’t think I can just betray him like that.

On the other hand Pam is my best friend. We’ve been friends since we were 17. If my girlfriend had been cheating on me, and Pam knew, she’d tell me. She deserves to know what Jim is doing. But I’m just unsure if I can out Jim like this.

What should I do?"

ctawvv,I(F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(F60s) and suddenly he wants back in,6414,0.98,421,2019-08-21 08:37:59,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctawvv/if30_divorced_my_ex_husband_m36_because_of_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ctawvv/if30_divorced_my_ex_husband_m36_because_of_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I will be rambling a little as I am very mad right now. Sorry for my bad English. It is not my first language

My Ex and I were married for well over 5 years and together for 10 . His mother was a nightmare. She would spent her time belitteling me and tried humiliating me. I could take it as i loved my husband and didn't want to make him choose between her or me.

Of course I would always tell him what she would be doing and he would always brush it off as her being ""a loving and over protecting mom ""

When she would say something racist ( I am Hispanic and they are white) he would laugh it off, when she would make a comment of me being a gold digger ( even tho I earned more than my Ex) he would just say ""Oh mom "" . He would also get mad at me if I ever stood up for myself.

But the straw that broke the camels back is when we had our daughter. My MIL would always try to parent her and say that i would do something wrong .

My daughter has an irritable colon and she can not ingest any kind of fucking oils or artificial things. And guess what that looney of a Woman did??

She fed my 3 year old daughter essential oils( she is not anti vaxx , just very stupid)  to make her go to sleep . She was in the ICU. I had it and i confronted my husband who said "" she only did what she thought was best "".

I lost it . I went to my parents and drafted a divorce agreement . ( Thats the best course of action. I saw a post earlier describing a situation that is much more dangerous than mine involving allergens and an epipen. )

His face was like that Pikachu Meme when i served him . He didn't know why i was doing that because we were ""happy"".

So now a year has passed and my life was hell.  My Monster in law tried every dirty trick in the book to take my Daugther . To name a few :

* She accused my brother of molesting her
* She accused me of neglect
* She accused me of taking drugs and leaving them in reach of a toddler ( I take thyroxin for heavens sake !)
* She accused me of endangering my daughter by leaving random man in my house
* the list goes on

During this time the excuse of my ex was that i *broke his heart and i had to undertstand his mother. She only wants whats best for him.*

Luckily i got good representation and even got my daughter full time  minus some weekends or visitation . I could prove that my daughter was endangered by his mother.

So now to the advice part.

I knew that my ex needed to be permanently in my life because of my daughter. And i was learning to live with that . He was very cold with me because again.. i broke his heart .

Now 2 things have come together :

* My ex BIL got married to an African American woman, so ofcourse my ex MIL flipped
* I started dating again

my BIL is a great guy and he actually stood up for his wife ( !!! go figure it is possible). I stay in contact with him because we are friends and hewas a mediator and fought with his brother quite often .So my BIL actually stood up for his wife and my ex husband got his panties in a twist, my BIL basically opened his eyes how shitty he was being. And that their mom treated me the same way she treated his wife. And finally my dense ex started understanding.

They guy I am seeing is great . I have even met his parents and his mother is normal . She treats me like a human being and has invited me allready to many family functions and tries to make me and my daughter feel welcomed . My ex got wind from the situation trough a mutual friend and guess who is now flipping his shit?

He started bringing flowers and chocolate ( I don't even like chocolate!!!) to pick up our Daugther. He sends me cards and sms with hearts and who knows what .

Yesterday was the ""best thing"". My daughter was at my mothers place and i was at home with my boyfriend. He appears infront of my door crying and clutching my engagement ring begging me to come back.

I said no and that he should go away. He wouldn't and started demanding that i come out to talk to him. My boyfriend told him that he would call the police ,and in his pathetic fashion  he threatened to beat my boyfriend up.

I closed the door and let him pound sand .

Today he picked up my daughter for a day trip and when they came back my daughter was asking if i loved my boyfriend more than her .

Now I am at a loss to what to do. I allready told my daughter that it was imposible because my love for her is infinite and there is nothing bigger than infinite.

But now i know that my ex is trying to make my daughter hate me .I am at a loss because i won't use my daughter as amunition. But also....what the hell am i supposed to do??I will never return with that man but i can't take the father of my daughter. Do you guys have any advice?


Edit /mini update : thanks you all! I needed to vent and was feeling helpless and am so thankfull for you wonderful people.

I talked to my lawyer who confirmed that we could have a case for domestic violence by proxy. A social worker will be visiting us in the next few days to talk to my daughter about this.


Edit : because apparently people want to spin the world narrative on me.
I don't care if he wants me back I don't love him anymore and will never get back together with him
Staying for the sake of our daughter would not make sense as it has been proven that the kids grow up happier and divorced homes than unhappy homes.

I tried talking to my husband when we were still married and he would always brush it off. He would brush off everything his mother did. I complained to him and told him we needed go to therapy wich he declined.

He has his daughter on the weekends. The court gave ne majority custody because of his mother.

Jeezs guys I guess in some of yalls eyes I should have kept being by my ex side às a submissive bimbo."
hk3rrf,My [21F] mother [46F] hates my sister [6F] with Down Syndrome and blames her for our dad leaving us. She won't let me take custody of her and I don't know how to continue living like this.,6417,0.98,384,2020-07-03 01:07:40,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hk3rrf/my_21f_mother_46f_hates_my_sister_6f_with_down/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hk3rrf/my_21f_mother_46f_hates_my_sister_6f_with_down/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"To preface this, we live in Austin,TX.

My mom was 39 when she got pregnant with my sister and a few days after her diagnostic screening confirmed it was a baby with Down Syndrome, our dad moved out and filed for divorce. Without my dad's income, mom had to sell our house and we moved to a different neighborhood. It was nice, but it wasn't an upper middle class neighborhood like the one we used to live in. During her pregnancy, she was committed to being the best mom to my sister (let's call her Mary) and me. A few weeks after giving birth to Mary who, other than Down Syndrome, had no other health issues, my parent's divorce was finalized. 

Mom got full custody and dad got visitation rights twice a week, but I refused to see him and he didn't want anything to do with Mary. To this day, we don't have a relationship at all. Him and mom were never very hands on parents, I had a lot of nannies growing up, but I never thought both of them would end up being so fucked up. The finalization of the divorce hit my mom like a truck and she spiraled into postpartum depression. I was a high school freshman when all of this happened and, on top of having to move to a different place where I didn't know anyone, I had to step up and help take care of my sister because my mom couldn't do it alone. 

While I was at school, she would do the most basic things like give Mary the bottle and change her diaper, and then she would wait for me to come home and ""help"" with the chores and Mary. To ""help"" was to clean up the house a bit, take care of Mary for the rest of the day (nap time, play time, sensory time, physical therapy at home following the activities spreadsheet her physical therapist gave us, changing her diapers, feeding her for the rest of the day and night, bathing her and putting her down to sleep), order dinner because neither one of us was a great cook and also find time to study and do schoolwork. 

Even though my mom had 10 weeks of paid maternity leave, she decided to go back to work when Mary was 8 weeks old. She did find the best daycare for her and I was honestly relieved knowing that Mary would be properly cared for while I was at school. My mom started to get better once she was back to work but she still didn't care that much about Mary, so I called her sister - my aunt - and told her everything. She offered to find my mom a good therapist and pay for it, and my mom agreed and she started therapy.

Something I feel is important to mention about my aunt, she married into a wealthy family and lives in Georgia. She has 3 daughters and a son (aged 16, 20, 23 and 25), and she's very conservative. While she's never openly talked about Mary having Down Syndrome, it's visible that she's bothered by it. She's especially bothered by the fact that my mom lost a ""good marriage and a good home"" because of Mary. She never calls for Mary's birthday but she does wire me $200 to get her a present, every single year. It's basically pity money to acknowledge that Mary exists and that's it. I'm waiting for the day I'm financially stable enough to give her back all the fucking birthday money she sent us over the years. 

During high school summer breaks, my mom would be angry with me because I refused to work and make money for my own expenses. My father did pay around 2k in child support for Mary and me, but that money would go towards our health insurance and whatever remained would be for me to buy anything Mary and I needed that wasn't food, medicine or gas. I didn't want to work because summers were the only time of the year I could actually have some time for myself. Every summer, Mary would only be in daycare a few times a week for a few hours while I would do housework and run errands, and we would spend the rest of our time together. She certainly had some developmental delays, but by the time she was 3 and a half, Mary was already walking, talking, sleeping in her big girl bed and she was potty trained. All of that because I worked with her and I did whatever I could to make sure she was as independent as possible. 

Right around that time my mom stopped seeing her therapist and she'd already been off antidepressants for a while. She was no longer struggling with depression, she just regretted having Mary and making peace with that was the hardest thing I ever had to do. I always hoped that she would get better and that she would come around, but no medicine could help the way she disregarded Mary. 

I graduated high school and even though I had known for years that college wouldn't be a part of my reality, it was a really painful time for me because it's something I wanted. Still, after a one month trial period at my friend's mom's event planning agency, I landed a full time, well paying job. Mom and I were a bit financially stressed because my portion of the child support ended when I turned 18, so this job really saved us and I was so excited to finally start saving money and to give Mary her own room since we were sharing one. But since I got a new job, my mom decided to cut her hours and only work part time because she was ""tired of being the sole breadwinner"" and ""she deserved to slow down and semi retire.""

I was really pissed off because I had to pay for roughly 70% of all monthly expenses for the household while she would pitch in here and there, and spend the rest of her money however she liked. She no longer felt obligated to financially contribute. I ended up getting a second job a few months later, it wasn't a full time job because I worked from home and I got to choose my projects. I basically booked social media influecers with companies and helped them figure out if they were a good match for advertisements and campaigns. It was really easy and I was able to make an additional $800 - $1500 a month. 

After about a year, I had saved enough to buy a really good used car. My mom did get me a used car for my 16th birthday but she didn't want to pay for all the repairs it needed so I spent over 3 years driving Mary and myself in an unsafe car. I was proud of myself so you can imagine the absolute shock that ensued when my friend called me to ask me why I was selling the car I just got. My mom posted photos of my car on her Facebook and put it up for sale because, according to her, I ""didn't need a fancy car."" She said we could split the money and I could get a more cost effective car since I had to be more responsible with my finances. The argument that followed was our biggest one yet and we ended up establishing some strict rules when it comes to our relationship. From that moment on, our mom became like a roommate to Mary and me. I even stopped calling her ""mom"" and started using her name. I did find comfort in knowing that Mary wasn't alone in this, our mother was treating me the same and it was not us, it was never us, she's just someone who never should've been a parent. 

I remodeled an upstairs office in our home and turned it into Mary's safari themed bedroom, I got us annual Disney passes, we travel and go on little road trips together, I've learned to cook pretty well and Mary loves helping me, I have 3 friends I consider family who love Mary and me unconditionally... It's a good life. A great fucking life, so I hate the fact that I'm subconsciously victimizing myself because of everything.

I've kissed once, I've been on 2 dates with 2 different guys, I've never had sex, I never party, I take Mary to my hair and nail appointments, I take care of all of her medical appointments and therapy, I know every nursery rhyme and toy unboxing video to ever have existed on YouTube. God I feel guilty even typing this out, but I get overwhelmed with sadness and bitterness when I think of the life I wanted and never got to have. I'm like a 50 year old trapped in a 21 year old girl's body. And it hurts even more when I hear how my mother compares me to my 20 year old cousin who moved to Austin for college. The two of them go shopping together, they have brunch together, she knows all about her fun college life, the boys she's dating and she makes sure to always emphasize how lucky my aunt is to have such great, accomplished kids. Another things she likes to do is mention how my other cousin has won several beauty pageants, and she only does this because my friends once asked me if I'd like to apply for our school's pageant and she tried to embarrass me in front of them by saying that I ""couldn't win anything with my daddy's face."" I throw myself a mini pity party whenever she kicks me where it hurts and then I look at Mary, at this sweet, little, soon to be 7 year old girl who just finished first grade with the most smiley and star stickers from her teacher, and I feel so ashamed of myself. 

Quarantine has been difficult for us because we suddenly had to be home with our mother all the time. I had to coordinate my work and Mary's homeschooling, and I really tried to minimize all outings because Mary has asthma which makes her high risk. My mother, however, would go to the store twice a day just to get out, or she would go to the park, and even now that things have started to open up she was the first one to go and eat out and visit friends like it's no big deal. Because of that, another huge argument ensued and I told her that we should go our separate ways if she'll let me take custody of Mary. I was serious and she knew that. She told me that Mary has already caused her embarrassment because she had to divorce and that she's not letting it happen a second time by making herself seem like she's unfit to parent. And she's right, I don't have much to go on even if I wanted to take her to court to claim that she's unfit, at least not with this budget. It would completely drain my finances and I would probably lose the case and lose Mary for good. She's not abusive or hostile towards Mary, she's just.. not anything towards her. It's not even neglect because she does pay for a few things and she will babysit if I have to run somewhere, but she's literally like a stranger/roommate to us, not a mom. 

That really crushed me and I was sitting in the kitchen thinking about everything when Mary came to ask me for a snack. I didn't hear what she said so she talked back and I yelled at her. I snapped at her for the first time ever and she looked at me the same way she looks at our mother. I'm so terrified that I'll allow myself to become like her because she's just pushing my buttons whenever she can. At this point, all I can do I save money like crazy and gather copies of all my finances and bills as proof that I take care of Mary, and wait for a few years until I can pay for a good lawyer and court expenses. I can't spend decades with this woman and wait until she dies and I get custody over Mary. I can't. I don't know what else to do to keep my sanity and most importantly, to stop these feelings of self pity and victimization because all they do is make me feel guilty and Mary doesn't deserve that. I need a pair of fresh eyes to read this and give me some advice.

__EDIT:__ I've been contacted by a legal advisor whose company does pro bono work, so I'm going from there. I also didn't want to make it sound like I have no money, I do - I have a great salary and I have enough to afford things like Disney trips and eating out a few times a week. But I pay for almost all household expenses, I pay for insurance, I pay for everything that Mary needs and that's why I don't have much in savings. I'm actually going to transfer half of the bills to my name and only pay my half, I know my mom well enough to know that she'll get a little mad and then she'll use this to milk more money out of my aunt. 

I will also pick up extra freelance work and since we've been actively quarantined, we've already cut back on a lot of expenses. With all of this, I'll be able to save even more to move out when the time comes. I don't want to drag Mary through court with corona on the loose because she's high risk, I'll give it a few months until things hopefully calm down a bit and then I'll take legal action. I just needed reassurance and encouragement that it is possible to find a way out.

__EDIT2:__ Oh and I promise I will have my friends babysit Mary and I will go out more (post corona) and do things for myself. Maybe I'll even start dating, I'll suck at it but hey, we all start somewhere. It's really easy for me to feel incapable when I need help, but you guys made it clear that help should be welcomed. I don't think I've ever felt this much support coming my way. I've also been researching therapists for a while now, I'm not sure if I'll go to therapy right now because I want to tighten our budget, but it's one of my priorities. And yes, my mom and aunt really are a pair of Karens. Don't I know it"

The reason at the time was our vision for the future wasn't compatible.  I wanted a family, white picket fence, etc.  She wanted to remain free and travel until her last day.  (FYI at the time we were married she shared my side of the vision).  There is a cliche about remaining friends but honestly I think we did at the beginning.  She met someone and married him in 2010.  He was older and had money and gave her that lifestyle.  We were close enough that I was invited to the wedding and made a brief toast.  Obviously with him in her life we drifted apart and basically played facebook tag.  

When we divorced I was depressed and got therapy, but after she was married and gallivanting around Europe and the Caribbean I got really depressed.  Therapy only helped so much.  It took about five years to really pull through and be myself.  I tried dating again and it never worked out, I honestly felt that I could never have been happier with anyone than I was with her.  I regretted putting my foot down about how I wanted to live.

Meanwhile, she was facebook documenting their attempts to get pregnant, the one thing she was dead set against at all costs (to the point that she wanted to get her tubes tied 'just in case').  Fertilization clinics, IVF, etc but nothing took.  They announced they had gotten a surrogate to carry their child, and tragically the child was stillborn.

Her husband passed away privately in 2021.  People only found out a month after his very private burial.  I messaged her saying I would be there for her if she needed someone to talk to.  I did not hear back.  Aside from posting inspirational messages, etc, she went dark.

On my birthday this year I received a card from her wishing me a happy birthday, thanking me for being such an important part of her life, and saying maybe we'll be in touch soon.

This last friday she called me, it was the first time I spoke to her directly in over a decade.  It was light conversation, I didn't bring up much of the last ten years, but she asked if I was free to get coffee or a drink today (tuesday), she was going to be back near where I live Mon-Thurs.  I agreed.

Since then we've texted a bit back and forth being slightly more intimate.  I get the sense she's testing the waters so to speak to see if there is interest there.  From my end it is a double edged sword.  There really would be interest in seeing where it might go but I don't think I could handle losing her a second time.  

I've asked a few friends and they've been split down the middle.  Don't get involved again vs. see what happens.

What do you think?  Has anyone every been in this situation where a relationship was rekindled after so long and what did you do?  What red flags or things to worry about should I be looking for?"

I've been feeling frustrated and sad by the general lack of empathy he's shown me over the years. It took a year of therapy for me to realize that, no, I'm not going crazy - my feelings are actually valid and I'm not always the one in the wrong. 

One example from last year was that he'd trickle truthed me about having kissed not one, but two people at a party. The only reason why I was able to get this out of him was because I'd gotten suspect of him asking if I'd ever ""done anything with anyone else"". 

Lo and behold - it was projection! lol

I was pretty numb, and kind of dazedly pushed for details. He blew up on me about ""Don't you think I already feel bad enough?? Why are you interrogating me"". Basically, the fight became about how bad HE felt and why I should feel bad for him.

We more or less addressed that, but I think something in me...snapped?  

I felt less and less willing to ""forgive and forget"" (especially without apologies, which are very, very rare) and kinda disengaged. 

This past weekend we rented a car to go to his mother's place for lunch. I mentioned that I'd like to try driving just a bit too, since I'm not used to driving in this country and it helps me be independent if ever I'm in a situation where I need to (I have a license, but back in my home country, and mostly on automatic cars). 

He came up with his usual excuse of ""no, you're not on the insurance/limited km/etc"" and changed the subject before I could get another word in.

I later brought it up in a playful manner during lunch, and he blew up on me in front of his mom (who said nothing). Slammmed things and yelled about...I don't remember, tbh i was just sorta bewildered by the violence of his reaction. I tried to downplay it because i was embarrassed. 

But I shut down since then. I just felt hurt and numb and...tired. 

He didn't apologize, but slowly pretended like everything was okay again. Until I brought up again how my feelings had been hurt, which made him angry again with me.

I took an angry walk and called my friend for support. When I came back, he'd suddenly sent me a gift card by email for a spa (a 7 months late bday present...) and seemed like he wanted to pretend like everything was fixed.

Spoiler alert: it's not lol

Since then I've been mostly doing my own things, and communicating a lot with friends from my home country, who are directly affected by a lot of what's going on right now. 

Today, he snapped and told me ""You disgust me"" because I'm always on my phone and disengaged.

I feel like I should be more hurt/shocked by this? It feels like a pretty strong thing to say. But I don't know. I'm too tired.

I don't know what my question for you all is. I guess I just needed to share my feelings in a place where they might be considered.

Thank you.

tl;dr: my husband called me disgusting because I'm often on my phone to find comfort from overseas friends and family."

It’s not a great update but you all deserve one for all of the advice you gave me on my last post.

He confirmed that he developed a crush on her, it’s an emotional affair at least and that’s all I really need to hear. I sat him down and had a heart to heart with him.

Bottom line are these points.

- if I hadn’t of heard what he said, he most likely would have continued flirting with her, he admitted this himself. 

- he liked the attention, she had bad mouthed me previously (I didn’t ask for examples) and he didn’t shut it down because he liked it.

- She has actively been persuing him for over 3 months now, he hadn’t put a stop to it until I caught him.

- The Saturday before last she offered to give him a blowjob during lunch together, he declined, but he told me that he let her feel his muscles over his clothes.

The only reason he said all of this fucking shit was because I was all sweet and I said “I promise, tell me the full truth and we can move on, I’ll forgive you, I just want to know” 

Right, fuck that. He is packing his bags. This is MY house, and it will be treated as such. I really don’t care anymore. If he’s seriously deluded himself into thinking this is going to last, he can crack on.

I’m genuinely so angry more than anything. I did everything for him. I make double what he does so I paid all the bills, while we used his money for fun stuff. When we met he had crippling CPTSD and body dysmorphia. I did fucking everything to help him get over it. I dealt with his night terrors every bloody night, despite it ruining my sleep. I reassured him constantly despite not getting it back. All of it without a bloody complaint. You love someone so much just for them to throw you away so easily.

He cried, had a panic attack that I had to calm him down from and is now taking his time packing. He keeps stopping to come into the living room to ask for a hug. I can’t even express how disgusted I feel, like I physically can’t even look at him anymore.

There was no need, if he was unhappy he should have told me, I don’t know why the hell he even felt the need to get some validation from this girl but sure, whatever.

He keeps saying he doesn’t know why he did it, but of course he knows, he’s just too much of a coward to tell me.

Well whatever, it’s done now. He’s leaving, his family is back in Germany so fuck knows who he’s staying with, probably her but I’m washing my hands of him. 

Thank you for all of the advice you gave me on the last post, so many great ideas that I didn’t even end up needing to use because he just down right admitted it all to me. 

Small update: 08/05/2024.

Had a phone consultation with a divorce attorney, I won’t know for sure until I meet with them in person next Friday but given the salary gap and the life we had I might have to pay alimony. Biggest bullshit I’ve ever heard. "

Here we go. My wife and I calmed down on Sunday to discuss this mess. I had been avoiding her all week until I could get my head around it. We took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. My wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. She had been rehearsing on what to say. When it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. She wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. She went on about not having other sexual partners etc. What she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

I told her that I would not , could not do this. I reminded her of the vows before God, family and friends we took on fidelity. I told her how she had violated the trust that I had for her. Look I understand what she is feeling. I know she wants new experiences. I told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. Maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. We never had a discussion about this. 

I told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this I was seeing a lawyer Tuesday to start divorce proceedings. At this point if she said she would not go thru with this I do not think I could not think she could be cheating at some point. That is where the trust comes in. I think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. I think equal division of assests, I expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. We will have to sell the house and each downsize. We actually had a good talk. Papers are being drawn. We hope  to get through this by fall.

I did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. Did not mention the lifestyle change. They can talk to their mom themselves. I will always love my wife. I will take the high road. I know many of you wanted scortched earth but I can not do that, its not me. I do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub. They thought I was trying to manipulate her into staying by using the marriage vows. I got to say that my religious up bringing has set my morals that I live by. This works for me. There are some that say its the 21st century no one lives that way anymore. There are many things I see others do and say that I do not agree with, but I do not try to impose my morals on them and conversly you should not denigrate what I believe. Remember my wife and I believed the same for close to 30 years, only recently has she made a change. I never held her down she was always free to chose. I believe in God and believe in my vows before him. Sorry enough soap box.

Last I want to thank all of your kind replies. I was overwhelmed. I only wish I could have replied to each and everyone. Thank you for letting me talk this out."

When I told my girlfriend she was upset that I hadn't asked her or told her, and a little upset about seeking other help. At one point she asked me if I didn't ""trust her to help me"". I did what I thought was best. I sat her down and told her how bad it really was, what the voices told me to do, how it was constant. I hated it, but at the end she apologized, saying ""I had no idea"" and agreed that psychiatry was the best option so that I could get better. Thank you all for the helpful advice and I hope I never have to see you again! Have a brilliant day!

Update 2 Electric boogaloo: Just got a call from my psychiatrist, he's starting me on a trial run of Trilafon and Zoloft, I'll update soon if something happens! Thank you and have an amazing day!

Edit: yikes this blew up, thank you all for the advice and to the person who gave me an award please message me so I can give it back, I don't need it. I'll post an update in a few weeks to let you all know how the treatment is going and maybe as a final goodbye before I delete this throwaway and go back to my normal account. Have an amazing day everyone!

Edit 2 electric boogaloo: I know some of you in the comments are worried about the age change. It's a typo. I fudged our ages and a few other details so she wouldn't know it's me (she frequents relationship advice) and accidentally put her actual age. We still met in high school and there's still a 2 year age gap between us."

My family and I ended up still going out to dinner that weekend and I also got to bring my boyfriend, yay. Dad texted me a while after the incident breaking the ice with ""birthday sex good?"". But we had a talk about some things and I ended up apologising to my mother. Apparently she was upset that I never told her but my dad knew, all is good on that front now.

Dinner went well. I officially came out during and was able to introduce my boyfriend to my family. Dad was in good humour as always, my mother seemed a bit concerned by my boyfriends size and kept bringing up how big he was lol but overall she liked him (edit: im talking about how tall and big he is, not his dick you perverts lol) . Dad and my boyfriend seem to get along well and have a lot in common so thats terrible haha. My siblings are also chill about everything and think my boyfriend is great too. 

After dinner we even stayed at my parents place for the night and that went quite well. Everything's looking up and theres no unneeded drama. Thanks everyone for your advice and good humour."
crza3d,Update: I (34M) think my wife (32F) is cheating on me.,6362,0.96,658,2019-08-18 15:14:22,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/crza3d/update_i_34m_think_my_wife_32f_is_cheating_on_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/crza3d/update_i_34m_think_my_wife_32f_is_cheating_on_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Original post from a few weeks ago:I travel a lot for work. I’m usually gone Tuesday through Thursday 3 times a month. My wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. We have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
About 6 months ago I caught my wife in a lie. Not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when I knew she wasn’t. It bothered me but not to the point where I was extremely concerned. Then a week before the 4th of July I came home early from my trip I wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. I had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip I booked for us to go to St Martin for a week. It was late when I got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had FaceTimed about three hours earlier so I could see her and the kids. She never mentioned anything about going out that night. When I got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. I texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. I said thats funny because I just got home and you’re not here. 
When she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn’t want me upset that she wasn’t home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), I didn’t really buy her excuse,  but I had no proof and she wasn’t admitting to anything. 
The next day I ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. I haven’t told her about it. And since then I have caught her in several lies, and I’m not even trying to set her up. She is just telling me she is at one place and I can see she is clearly not. 
Should I confront her with what I did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

TLDR I caught my wife in a lie so I got a gps for her car. Then I caught her in multiple lies.

I hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. My wife has been acting normal all day. We had plans tonight, I canceled told her I was not feeling well (which is the truth). I don’t think anything else will happen until I leave Tuesday morning. I plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on Monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer I’m sure he can point me in the right direction. Thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. I’ll update when the PI does his thing.

Update: so I hired a private investigator to follow my wife when I left on Tuesday. He first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. He told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or CC. She left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. He witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. He followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. He was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. He has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. They were there for about 3.5 hours. He then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife’s car was parked. She went home and didn’t leave the rest of the day.

Wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. That night around 9:15 (I FaceTimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. She again met with the same women. This time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. She was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

So there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. I really don’t know what to do now. The PI was pretty expensive I’m not sure I want to hire him again. Not sure if I should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

Update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. I kept the PI following her when I have been out of town. It has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. This Wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. The PI got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. The kiss is not something just friends would do. This is the first real evidence I have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
I flew home a day early, and last night I confronted her with the photos. I didn’t tell her how I got them or that I had hired a PI. I asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. She basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. She then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. I couldn’t believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
I haven’t moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, I’m still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

Update: so I have the woman’s name,age and where she works from the PI. She is single no kids, she has a Facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. No instagram or Twitter that he can find either. I think I’m done with him he found out enough."

I wanted to update the kind people who took the time to give me advice when I really needed it. There have been some developments.

Original post for background:

*Feeling very lost and could use some help…*

*Things had been hard on the whole family after the passing of my bio dad in 2011 and stepdad in 2017. But I never expected this. Trying not to make assumptions and to figure out my hand in this but I’m having a really hard time. Here's the whole conversation:* [*https://imgur.com/a/NokJeIm*](https://imgur.com/a/NokJeIm)

*The “you” in the message is my brother (38M), who came over after his 3 year old son woke up from his nap. Coincidentally that was 10 minutes or so after I got there around 5pm.*

*Even more complicated is that stepmom lives with my half-bro (31M), her son, who hasn’t answered my messages since. I also attempted to get in touch with my half-sis (34F) who lives across the country a couple of weeks before this happened and she hasn't called me back. I’m certain she knows what’s going on because she and my stepmother, her bio mom, are close.*

*Where do I go from here?*

*Is this someone I could ever trust to let in my life again even if she does come around? She hasn’t answered my message or my big brother's.*

*Thanks*

There was a lot of concern about the possibility of UTI-related [delirium](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delirium/symptoms-causes/syc-20371386?fbclid=IwAR13Jlvhvd1NguEXZPkhR7oQCTZwI2LSI-jLjvqpQnnQXWr9JQwMwGWRE2s) being a possible cause of her behaviour. I took your advice and sent this to my half-bro (he replied by email today, more about that later): [https://imgur.com/a/3K7IDno](https://imgur.com/a/3K7IDno)

Yesterday I saw my doctor because I needed a note for work and possibly resources. She also happens to be my mom’s doctor and has been our family doctor since I was little. I told her everything and that I was worried about delirium or something. She was very confused, said it didn’t sound like my mom and that she had always talked about us all lovingly as her children. I left feeling better knowing that at least her doctor can keep an eye out now. She also gave me some antidepressants and I’m going back to see her next week.

This morning I sent this to my half-sis: [https://imgur.com/a/fAQPJFp](https://imgur.com/a/fAQPJFp)

She called and was very quiet.

I asked her are you not shocked?

She said no, that she had been talking with mom about it already.

I asked if she thought this might be a medical issue like delirium and explained what it was. I asked if she thought mom was acting erratically lately, and if she thinks this was out of character for her.

She said no very quickly, which makes me think they’ve been talking about this for a while now.

So I’m less worried that it is a medical issue.

I asked why she isn’t bothering to tell me what she thinks I’ve done instead of jumping right to this?

She said mom did tell me in that message, that she feels I don’t care for or respect her.

I asked her specifically something I could have done differently.

She mentioned that mom said after her knee surgery in September that I wasn’t around.

I messaged my mom the day of her surgery and she never replied [https://imgur.com/a/idazidq](https://imgur.com/a/idazidq). I also replied to my little bros updates on our family Facebook group about her surgery going well. After still getting no reply from her, I called her a week later, went over the same night with flowers and a bracelet that I made her. I offered to help out or cook dinner sometime, she said no thanks. She had my bro and her boyfriend there taking care of her so I was glad she was in good hands.

I told my sister all this and she replied that she’s not here (lives across the country) and doesn’t know all the facts, which is fair. But also said that little bro is around and he agrees with mom.

She also told me mom said she was hurt by my reply back to her Facebook message, that she felt I made it all about me.

I asked her if she could possibly understand how it would feel.

She said I should be more understanding, that mom took 2 kids in and loved us like her own.

I told her that’s not true because this wouldn’t be happening to her, but that’s okay. I accepted already that it might not even be possible for her to feel as connected to me as to her bio kids. But I still thought she loved me and I didn’t expect this.

I told my sister I was also hurt that she didn’t call me back last week when she knew what was going on.

She asked why I was making it about her, and I yelled I’m your sister and you weren’t there for me, my emotions got the better of me.

She said her life is busy and it’s been a rough year for her too (she has MS and her husband has been away from home last year for school).

I told her she could call me when it’s rough.

We said I love you and hung up.

After this conversation, big bro and I got this email from little bro: [https://imgur.com/a/NBq1CQt](https://imgur.com/a/NBq1CQt)

I did evaluate my actions and I’m still confused. I know I love her and I tried to be there, and for whatever reason she won’t see it and was willing to cut me out of her life for years to come without a real explanation or reasonable attempt at fixing it. It feels like she looked for all the reasons she could possibly interpret to mean I don’t care or respect her and ignored the rest. If I ask her to give me more examples of how I made her feel that way, I’m afraid she’ll take it as making excuses again or making it about me like she told my sister about my first message, which she never replied to.

Not even sure how to reply to little bro. He has no interest in debating or mediating, so should I be replying directly to mom, or at all?

Thanks <3

15pzrp7,My (38F) husband (43M) refuses to give up his gym girlfriend or even talk about the issue.,6320,0.96,1273,2023-08-13 19:34:46,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15pzrp7/my_38f_husband_43m_refuses_to_give_up_his_gym/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15pzrp7/my_38f_husband_43m_refuses_to_give_up_his_gym/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"On Father's Day I noticed my husband texting and smiling with someone, ignoring or not seeing me when I invited him to the table for breakfast. I got closer so he could notice me and saw he was texting an unknown woman. (We've been married for four years and have a preschooler and a 1 year old.) 

I didn't bring it up besides asking ""who is that?"", since my Mom was in town visiting. When I mentioned it later, I said I didn't know making friends of the opposite sex and not saying anything was okay for us. He didn't volunteer anything but when pressed further mentioned that he'd been working out with her (which I know is 3/4 days a week for 2-3 hours before work most mornings).

He ended up admitting he didn't tell me about her because he knew I'd be mad, moreover that he'll be working out with whoever he wants. Fast forward several one sided, vulnerable conversations and two months after a lot of feeling sick to my stomach and sleepless nights, I finally laid it out:

I didn't give him an ultimatum - I simply told him I can't sleep, that I feel heartbroken and constantly concerned. That if I was doing the same he'd feel awful. And *crickets* I asked how long it was going to last and was met with, ""There's no sign up sheet in the gym"".

I told him I can't imagine continuing our relationship feeling like this and needed to know in words how he felt. He reported feeling the same, that I'm his wife and he loves me. My boundary is unacknowledged and so far, unenforced. It's not that I think he's put his dick in her (yet?), it's that he won't budge or say anything knowing I'm hurting. I feel like I'm getting more heartbroken daily, the impulse to check his phone is hard to resist at times. I don't want to leave, but I need more than this lack of response from him.

At no point have I asked him to stop going to the gym or working out with her. I told him I wouldn't ask that, that he's free to do what he likes, but that he should think of something he's comfortable with to address the issue and rebuild trust. I suggested having her over for dinner. You can guess how that went. He said nothing.

TLDR: I'm jealous that my husband spends 8 hours plus a week with another woman at the gym, time we don't have together as parents of young kids. I want to bail.

RESOLVED: He apologized sincerely, changed gyms and went no contact (confirmed on phone records quietly). He found a therapist for us and has been scheduling our sessions every couple of weeks. Was he a jerk? Definitely. But he's acting like a jerk who loves me and wants to stay married.

UPDATE: When he left for work this morning (a day later) I told him to think about what I said throughout the week. I appreciate all the support, including the comments that bring up that I may be jealous or have let my body go, or especially that I have been too permissive as a wife. I'm completely open to criticism in my personal arena. 


UPDATE II: He came home Monday night in a mood, refusing to eat dinner and arguing over unrelated issues and eventually saying angrily, ""Just so you know, we're no longer working out because of you.""

But I had phone records and screenshots of their conversations indicating many, as in a majority of deleted texts. I will never know what they said and I frankly don't even care. Turns out he texted her showing her this post and SHE (a sweetheart and a stranger) was the one who had the consideration to not work out anymore. By the way, not ever what I wanted. I wanted to know why on earth he's hiding a friend and deleting texts. I want to know why I'm noth worth comforting or at the very least the truth, or a conversation on why he feels distant enough to lie.

He stonewalled, shut me down, gave me the silent treatment all night and all day Tuesday. When he arrived home, high, I asked him if he wanted to talk or walk. As in, we're going to counseling and you're making the appointments or I'm following through on one of my five divorce lawyer consults I had by phone on Monday.

In the end I asked to see his texts where I found out the above: that he doesn't have the balls to tell her himself what was going on, just the cruelty to let me suffer another day having read my post, and to show my heart to a FUCKING STRANGER! And act like it was my fault. 

Had he at any point opened up about why he was hiding her, had he not deleted texts after saying he wanted to rebuild trust, had he given me any information or compassion, this would be very different.

He didn't want to hand over the phone for me to check for more deleted texts one last time, and I mean the last time because I'm not losing any more sleep over this.  I had to call his mom to tell her to get his room ready before he handed it over.

He says he loves me and wants to stay, that he didn't want to hurt me. He's asking if I still love him. He knows I do. I told him to take a hard look at whether or not he loves me (in light of the many other ways he's showed me I'm worthless to him). I told him he was the most selfish person I've ever met. What a stupid and cowardly way to throw me away.

FYI:

1.) He is body building, and commuting 40 minutes to get to this gym by work, 30 miles away.

2.) He leaves at 4:00 in the morning to go to this gym, so confrontation is not a possibility. I can't get child care at that time.

3.) So many of you are absolutely right - the lack of response to me is the problem, independent of this poor other woman. 

4.) I don't have family to run to besides his mom. Last time I tried to get some space after a verbally abusive episode he gaslighted and made false claims that I have postpartum, am suicidal (really just exhausted), and threatened to call the cops saying I was kidnapping my children if I left. To a known place, with his mother."
1dt5dst,Update 1: My (28F) best friend (28F) kissed my husband (27M) and it’s destroying me. How do I proceed?,6328,0.95,1086,2024-07-02 03:31:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dt5dst/update_1_my_28f_best_friend_28f_kissed_my_husband/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1dt5dst/update_1_my_28f_best_friend_28f_kissed_my_husband/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"After reading a lot of the comments, I realized that it was possible that my husband was having an affair with my best friend and he knew about the camera and acted accordingly to make sure I didn’t suspect an affair. Her running out of the house crying, my husband showing me the footage before I asked, and his lovebombing would all make sense if he was cheating with my best friend. I can’t be with a cheater and I had to make sure my husband was loyal to me. On a side note, I made sure that my husband was okay and well after being forcibly kissed and he said he was fine and he didn’t “feel” assaulted and it was just a kiss. He said that he was just worried about me because he knew how much this friendship meant to me.

Over the weekend, I looked through my husband’s phone and laptop while he was doing yard work. Both of us have full access to each other’s phones and I didn’t find anything out of the ordinary in my husband’s phone. I checked his messages, WhatsApp, social media and deleted messages folder. There was nothing suspicious on his phone or laptop. This morning after my husband left to go to work, I arranged for our next door neighbors, a friendly, elderly couple, to watch the girls for  a couple of hours and I went to my best friend’s place without telling her I was coming. She works afternoon shifts so I knew she would be there in the morning. She let me in and she seemed scared and I demanded to know the truth. She said that she had always been really attracted to my husband and she had tried making advances before but my husband always just shut her down. She admitted to being jealous of me and my perfect life with my husband. I should have seen the signs earlier. When our firstborn was learning to speak, my best friend would always try to get her to call her “mama”. When she held our daughter for the first time, she “accidentally” sat in my husband’s lap. She has been trying to replace me for years and I never noticed and my husband kept rejecting her advances because he only wanted me. She said that she had drank more than she should have at the barbecue and she decided to try her luck when she saw my husband was going inside alone. I forced her to show her phone as well and again, there was nothing implying an affair and all the messages appeared to line up with my husband’s phone so I knew there was nothing deleted or manipulated. She apologized profusely and asked me to not end our friendship over this. I told her that she’s nothing to me and she could have been happy for me and I treated her like a sister all these years just for her to try and steal my life.

Now, I know for sure that my husband never cheated, the guilt for doubting him is eating me up. If I tell him that I snooped through his phone and laptop and met up with my ex best friend to verify that he wasn’t cheating, it’s going to impact our marriage and he’ll be very disappointed in me for not trusting him and if anything, he will lose his trust in me. If I don’t tell him, the guilt is going to continue eating me up. I’ve never lied or kept secrets from him before and I don’t want to start now but this is an impossible choice. He’s only ever shown me how much he loves and cherishes me and he doesn’t deserve to be betrayed like this. 

I will update more when I tell him the truth. 

Update: I told my husband everything, that I looked through his phone and laptop and that I confronted ex best friend. I showed him both Reddit posts and told him that even the few comments that speculated that he was having an affair made me paranoid and I acted on it. I apologized to him for doubting him and thanked him for always being an amazing husband and always turning down her advances and for spoiling me, especially when I was down. He said that he understands and he said he should have told me earlier about her trying her luck earlier. 

I’m also starting therapy next week to figure out my paranoia and trust issues, process the end of my friendship, and in general try to get into a better mental space so I can be better as an individual, wife, and mother.

We have been having bedroom issues for about 3 months now and it’s mostly my fault because usually I’m not in the mood or I’m just tired. We get along great and rarely have issues. We had a small argument about me having certain freedoms and choices without his input and the bedroom issue. 

He said he was going to the store and would be back in 30 mins at 8pm but that turned into him coming home at 3am really drunk crashing and banging through the house and up the stairs. I thought someone had broken in but when I saw it was him I just told him to take off his outside clothes and get in bed to sleep it off. A couple of minutes later while I’m trying to fall asleep he starts touching me and putting his hands down my pants. 

I tell him that I’m tired and to stop but he doesn’t and continues. He managed to get on top of me and pulled my bottoms off and we start having sex. He put his hand in the back of my head and grabbed my hair so I couldn’t move my head. I started reaching down to try and get him to stop but he was pressed up against me. When he was finished he just rolled over and went to sleep. He was always so nice to me and I thought I married a good and respectable man but obviously not. The entire time he didn’t even speak or even kiss me. He just stared at me. 

In the morning he acted like everything was fine and asked if I wanted him to make me breakfast. I asked if we were going to talk about last night and he said yes. When we sat down to eat he apologized for coming home late and not answering the phone and then coming home drunk. I told him I didn’t care about that and the only thing I cared about was him basically forcing me to have sex. He looked confused and asked what I was talking about. I told him everything and he started crying and apologizing saying he would never do it again and would never sip another drop of alcohol. He begged me not to leave him but I already have my mind set and asked that he give me space to think.

Prior to my second deployment, I was administered ""Stellate ganglion block"" or SGB treatment for PTSD which greatly alleviated my symptoms so I continue to operate within my required parameters.

I thought she had sent a friend to pick me up and drive me to our apartment.  
  
My fiancee was shocked, considering she jumped on me to give me a hug and I was thoroughly confused as to who she was. I'm having trouble putting her face to her name and her personality. It feels like I'm engaged to my fiancee but she does not look like my fiancee. All my pictures of her are the same, and I don't recognize them in hers anymore either.  
  
I've been to several therapists and psychiatrists without any help. None of them has solved these issues.

Thank you so much for my first gold, kind stranger! That's really sweet. Hugs! <3

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/901lyn/i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy_26m_i/

First of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. I never imagined that I would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. When I posted, I was in a pretty bad place (I think I typed the post out on my bathroom floor where I had been crying). Thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. Also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. I read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. I appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

Special thank you to u/Janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. I got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

About two days after I posted, I told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. He was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. He drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while I peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. I was positive for hCG so the pregnancy was real. I was about five weeks. He held me as I cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

That day, I called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for Wednesday. I was early enough to take Mifeprex (the pill). On Tuesday, my best friend (the one that I mentioned in my original post) finally came back from Africa and I told her immediately. She hugged me close and I cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

On the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. I took Mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. Right after I took the Mifeprex, I felt complete and utter relief. It felt better than the day I finished all of my college applications. All of my stress instantly dissipated. I knew I was going to be okay and that I had my life back on track. My friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. I'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and I'm so thankful for them.

So yes, I had the abortion and I feel completely relieved.

One thing that I did do that I said I probably wasn't was that I told ""Nick"". I was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. But I hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and I thought that if I do end up getting a position at the lab, I would see him everyday. It would be very difficult for me to see him and know that I kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. He's also someone that never gave me any red flags and I was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. So I texted him the day after I made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. I told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him I already schdued the abortion. He was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. He said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. He then got up and hugged me again. He offered to come with me and pay for the pill and I told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. He told me to call him if anything came up or if I needed anything. I nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. And that was that. 

I could tell he was relieved and I expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

In all, I made the right choice and had an amazing support system. Thank you especially to Reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while I was at my lowest. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

TL;DR: Got the abortion and told Nick about it. I feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. Life's good and back on track.

dkixq4,Caught my (m34) wife (f30) cheating on me and she is furious with me,6272,0.97,581,2019-10-20 17:53:37,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkixq4/caught_my_m34_wife_f30_cheating_on_me_and_she_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dkixq4/caught_my_m34_wife_f30_cheating_on_me_and_she_is/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"A week ago my wife said she was going out with univesity friends after some volunteer shifts that she does. She said she would be home late and not to worry, after 11pm she said she was going to stay at her friends house and go to work from there in the morning. This is very unusual so I started calling and messaging like crazy hoping that she could just take a taxi back. She refused to pick up the phone and told me not to worry. 

She continued to refuse and was obviously v drunk so I became worried and very suspicious. Not proud of it but I went into her emails and checked the rota for her volunteer work and sure enough she wasn't on it. This led me to check her Internet history and I found a whole heap of searches clearly indicating an affair.

I went to work that morning and she still wasn't back so I confronted her when I got home that evening. She admitted the searches and said they were just her fantasies and that she had been at an 80s night and nothing had happened. When I told her she hadn't stayed with at her friends she admitted that too but said she had been at the club all night and came straight home. Obvious lies as she was looking at hotels online and from card payments from our joint account I can see was not in a place that does 80s nights.

So I'm not an idiot and it's 100% clear what has happened but she will not admit it and becomes really angry with me when I bring it up. She says constantly that she stayed out and made the searches because I have never paid her enough attention and she needed more intimacy from me. 

I'm losing my mind because I still want to fix this but can't even proceed to the first step of accepting the situation (let alone forgiving her) as she wont admit what is obvious. Shes so angry with me and has recently told me she is scared of me now because I was so angry the evening after she was out all night. She doesn't look remotely sorry for how she has acted and now when I bring up the night she simply says I told you everything I'm not gonna talk about it. This,  even though her story is provably false.

I feel like I'm purgatory now. Together for 10 years and I don't even know this person.

I need to know is this kind of behaviour typical for someone who has been having an affair? 

If so are there ways I can get her to admit what she has done, or at least be willing to answer my questions in a believable way?

Is there a way I can move forward because everything I do is hitting a wall."

My partner of 11 years seperated with me last week, I then found out she’s been sending photos to a guy, arranging dates with him etc. I still live with this woman in a rental that I pay all the rent and bills on, she is also the mother to my 4 year old daughter. We’re not married, by the way & we’re located in the UK.

Apparently the break up is all my fault, I wasn’t there for her. Didn’t help enough, and wasn’t a committed father. I love my daughter to the end of the earth. Admittedly, I could have done more around the house perhaps? But I also work 8:30-6 Monday-Friday and earn six figures a year so my job is quite demanding. Whilst she works 2 days a week part-time.

My predicament is, she split up with me & now wants me to leave the house. She says that because of the amount of money she earns it’s her only choice, and that if I stay she will be homeless & so will my daughter. She cheated on me, separated us after 11 years, broke our family, and now wants me to leave? What on earth do I do"
a0szwb,General advice for anyone trying to decide whether to stay in or go back to a relationship,6269,0.87,343,2018-11-27 14:00:28,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0szwb/general_advice_for_anyone_trying_to_decide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a0szwb/general_advice_for_anyone_trying_to_decide/,self.relationship_advice,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"If you are wondering whether you should stay in a relationship or go back to your ex, I have a mental exercise for you.

&#x200B;

Close your eyes and imagine you are holding a puppy- any breed you like. Feel it's warm weight against your chest, it's soft sweet breath on your neck. Stroke the puppy's soft fur, feel the fineness of its skin and the delicate bones beneath, touch it's tiny paws, smooth and soft against your skin, kiss its little domed skull and look into its gentle, trusting eyes.

&#x200B;

Are you holding your puppy? Do you feel its softness, it's warmth, its vulnerability- that soft little mouth, peach like nose and all those fragile little bones? Do you feel its weight in your arms, snuggling up against your heart- trusting and relying on you.

&#x200B;

OK, now give that puppy to your partner/ ex.

&#x200B;

If the breath stills in your lungs, if your heart clenches, if you hesitate, then you need to ask yourself why.

&#x200B;

Is it because they are a bully- who would shout at and hit the puppy, bruising that thin skin and breaking those fragile bones? Is it because you know that they'd neglect the puppy, leaving it alone, possibly hungry and cold and ignoring its cries for attention and affection. Is it because they are contradictory- a person who is nice whilst the world is going their way but who will turn on you for breathing if something goes wrong in their life?

And, if you'd hesitate over giving that puppy to your partner, why the hell are you giving yourself to them?! Aren't you worth as much as an imaginary dog?

&#x200B;

Too often, in life, we seriously undervalue ourselves and excuse away behaviours which we'd find inexcusable if another person was subjected to them. However, we are just as vulnerable and breakable as the next person- and just as valuable.

&#x200B;

So, don't put up with behaviours which you wouldn't wish on a dog. If someone abused a puppy, you'd take that puppy out of the situation- do the same for yourself. If someone ignored their puppy, spending all of their time with other people/ doing other things, you'd know that the puppy was not getting the physical, mental and emotional stimulation it needed and you'd find someone who had time for the puppy- again, do the same for yourself. If someone abandoned a puppy, leaving it crying, you wouldn't chase after the person to give the puppy back to them... You're getting the drift?

&#x200B;

Value yourself. And, if it helps, think of your soul as that puppy you imagined. Look into its trusting eyes- its relying on you to find someone kind, someone patient, someone with love and time to give. You are responsible for your own health and happiness and that loving, caring person might be sitting there lonely, waiting for someone just like you to come into their life.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_EDIT\_\_\_\_\_

  
Someone asked ""What if you know you mistreat the puppy yourself too?""

The answer is simple: take a long, hard look at how you treat the people in your life and work out how you can change your behaviour so that you can treat 'the puppy' (e.g. friends/family/your S.O) well.

We're all 'bad' people to some extent; all greedy, lazy, selfish, hypocritical, temperamental, judgemental, cowardly and even cruel. However, what you are isn't the end of the story. A 'good' person is someone who looks at their options, second by second, and always tries to chooses to take the better path; it's not the only path or the easiest path but they choose the right path because they have self-respect.

These 'choices' can happen at the deepest of levels; whatever people say, we can actually control our thoughts and our feelings if we put in the effort: for example, you might look at someone and think 'ugly' but, if you're trying to be a better person, you'll then think to yourself 'No, stop that. It's unkind and shallow'. Or you might see someone with something you want and feel a stab of jealousy, then think 'why am I jealous, I've got my friends, my family, etc and that's more important than x'. Choices- every moment of every day- and if you try to think only kind, rational thoughts and feel only kind, positive feelings, then you'll find it easier and easier to do the right thing.

It is the choices we make in life which are important; make the kindest, most selfless and thoughtful choice and you'll find that you are happier because you'll be able to look in the mirror and see someone you respect.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_EDIT 2\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I've written an additional edit because certain questions/comments seem to reoccur and, as there have been so many comments, my original answers to substantially similar questions/comments are now a couple of pages back and I know repeating/copy-pasting annoys people.

&#x200B;

Edit 2A:

If you are allergic to or don't like dogs, you can also visualise another type of animal or a human baby if that is more relevant to you.

&#x200B;

Edit 2B:

A number of people have been making comments along the lines of 'my Ex/S.O. is great with animals/loves dogs but treats/treated me badly"" or ""is a vile person""

If your ex/S.O would treat/treats their dog better than they treat you:

a. make a list, one with the differences between their behaviour to you and their behaviour towards the dog;

b. do the visualisation again, but imagine that they'd treat the puppy just like they treated you.

&#x200B;

You wouldn't leave an abused/neglected dog with someone just because they were kind to their other pet and, more importantly...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*You are more important than an imaginary dog!\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Edit 2C:

Emotional distress. Some abusive behaviours, e.g. adultery, won't affect a dog like they do a human partner. However, the important point is that pain and distress caused. If a person does something knowing it will cause severe hurt, then use a comparative physical hurt in your visualisation.

&#x200B;

Edit 2D.

Finally, people have also commented that this doesn't apply to situations where people are just incompatible. No, it doesn't; it was designed to help people with high levels of empathy to realise that they need to protect themselves as much as they'd protect an animal.

&#x200B;

However, that said, anyone who has ever bought a dog from a reputable breeder will know that great humans will not be allowed to buy a great dog if they are fundamentally incompatible. If you want a collie and your favourite past-time is sitting on your backside, no reputable breeder will let you walk away with a pup because, although you might be the nicest, kindest person in the world, you will be driven up the wall by an energetic dog who will be literally running up the walls if they don't spend hours hiking around the countryside.

Where there's incompatibility, it often leads to both parties making compromises for the duration of their relationship. People rarely change in fundamentals and you need to ask yourself; 1. what compromise/s do we need to make to meet each other half way? 2. am I willing/able to make my compromises? 3. is my S.O. also willing/able to make their compromises? 4. will we both be able to live, long term, in the compromise situation? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you are going to get frustrated with each other, the frustration will probably turn into irritation and the irritation will probably turn into recrimination because we all, secretly think 'if they love me, they will change' without asking ourselves 'if I love them, why don't I change?'

So, if you are a collie and your S.O is a couch potato, then you'll either have to accept that you'll get 50% of the exercise you need and they will have to do 50% more than they want OR you go and do your exercise whilst they play video-games and you meet up for meals. Or you break up and make sure that, in the future, you automatically rule out anyone who is not in running gear!"

I proposed to her this past Fall after lurking on this sub and reading some advice that put things in perspective for me and made me realize i really wanted it. Through all of the stress of planning and financing a wedding ourselves, we have realized that we are spending WAY too much time worrying about what will make the event memorable for everyone else and forgetting the most important part, us.

He was arrested for uploading child porn. Out on bail. Told to stay offline. While compiling evidence for his jury trial, they realized it was him in a video of a little girl performing oral sex. She was later identified as his daughter. 

I have known him and his wife since middle school. Stayed close. Visited as often as possible. Love(d) both of them to pieces. Stayed at their house with my kids.

Known their little girl since she was born, obviously. Helped with her diapers on occasion. Last time I visited I thought, she's being a bit of a brat, you guys should check that! Now I feel like a piece of shit.

I had absolutely no idea. I don't go on FB often anymore. She posted asking people not to repost the news article. I was like, what? So I googled. Jesus christ. 

Now I know. I really don't know anyone. No one does. And one of my best friends and her sweet kids are having their lives turned around and fucked up and I can't do anything.

I read your responses and decided to make a big apology to my girlfriend for how I behaved. However, before I got chance, she arrived at the house. 
I'll hold my hands up and say that this isn't the first time I've jumped to conclusions and pretty much since we got together, I've had a habit of winding myself up and then checking her phone/accounts. I know it's wrong, but I always felt if I found something I'd be justified which is so messed up, I know. 

My ex did cheat on me. Well, she had an affair and left me for the other dude. I guess I projected this onto my current girlfriend. My girlfriend never, ever has given me any reason to doubt her and treats me better than I've ever been treated before. She's down to earth, honest, open, funny, kind, beautiful and she gives me to opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with no judgement. 

I don't know why I assumed the worst of her, I really don't. 
To answer a common question - she has online banking app on her phone and it's the same passcode as her mobile so I could log on. Super super fucked up, I know. 

When she arrived at the house, she was calm but sad. She explained that she knew I'd always check her phone and that I'd be ""off"" with her anytime she went out with friends but that she always hoped over time, if she proved herself, I'd let go. When she found out that I'd done what I did, it hurt even more because she was trying to do something nice for me. 
She told me she loves me but she finds herself justifying every activity she does, over explaining herself and told me she has real, genuine anxiety whenever she's out with friends because she knows I'll be sat at home imagining scenarios of where she could be. She found herself withdrawing from friends. 

She told me we were over. Not because she doesn't love me, because she can't devote her life to someone who only sees the worst in her. She told me that I could have just spoke to her and she'd be honest but that she knows even if she did, I wouldn't believe her unless I could prove it and she's probably right. I don't know why, but I know in myself I would not fully believe her because I mean, of course she'd say that, right? Anyway... She left me. Packed up her things and went. 

I know her, she's a strong minded woman. It really is over and I've never felt worse. But she's right, I'm not ready to trust someone yet and even in our last moments, she gave me the confidence and motivation to get help and be better, even if she won't be there to see the change. I know she loves me and that fact alone makes it worth changing myself. 

I'm not going to try and win her back, because I can't promise I won't do it again. I'm heartbroken and hurt but she verbalised it in such a way, it really hit home. She calmly explained it to me in a way that only showed me her true love for me. 

I'm just so sorry for hurting her, I guess. 

But, thank you all for sharing your opinions and giving me some home truths. I appreciate it more than you know. 

This is it for now, hopefully this time next year I'll be a new man and be able to treat the next woman who loves me, the way my ex girlfriend deserved to be treated. 

**Tl;Dr** my gf left me. She made the right choice. I'm reflecting and moving forward."
is9io4,My wife stopped taking her birth control without informing me,6227,0.99,903,2020-09-14 05:13:08,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/is9io4/my_wife_stopped_taking_her_birth_control_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/is9io4/my_wife_stopped_taking_her_birth_control_without/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"My wife and I have been married almost nine months. We tied the knot last December. We came into the relationship both wanting children, however we had mutually discussed and agreed to wait until we owned a home, I finished school, and we had our finances in order more to start trying. The entirety of our relationship, she's been on the pill as her preferred method of birth control. 


My wife is out having dinner with her parents tonight while I'm hanging out at the house with some friends. She had ordered groceries to be delivered earlier today, and when they arrived I, of course, started to put things away. One of the items she purchased was a pregnancy test, which was such a shock that I literally felt my stomach drop when I saw it. 


Immediately I called her, and asked why on earth she  ordered a pregnancy test. Turns out about a month ago she decided to stop taking her pill because she thought we were ready for children. I asked why she wouldn't get my input on something so HUGE and she replied that she ""wanted to surprise me."" I told her there's literally a hundred different surprises that I would prefer currently, told her I'd see her later, and ended the call. 


Her period is due later this week, so unless she plans on taking it early we won't know if she's pregnant for a few days. I'm livid! We are not in the position to become parents currently. I certainly don't want to be bringing a newborn into the world during a pandemic. I don't know if it's justified considering we are married and both eventually want children, but I feel absolutely betrayed that she would make a decision like this behind my back. We had even agreed that if somehow we got pregnant while she was on the pill that we wouldn't go through with the pregnancy. I know she'll be coming home soon, and honestly I don't even want to look at her right now or know what to say. 


Am I right to be upset about this? What should I do? I'm currently working a full time job while pursuing my masters; I literally do not have the time to be a suitable parent.


Edit: She just texted me:

I'm so sorry that you're reacting this way. You've seemed really unhappy lately and I thought you would consider this good news"""

My ex and I divorced late November of last year. I would share why but it’s a super long story. Just know that it was really messy!

Anyways, he came back a month ago wanting to reconcile. I asked him kindly to give me time to consider things and then  us time to rebuild and take things slowly if I decide to proceed. 

However, he’s giving me ultimatums stating that he wants to get back together sometime this year soon or he’ll just marry/get engaged to someone else. But he’ll “propose anyway just to give me the opportunity remarry him”. 

Like wtf.

I just came out of a whole marriage with him I’m not looking to remarry him or anyone else in the near future. 

I’m just super confused as to why I’m being rushed to reconcile with him. I would be more receptive to start all over and build everything back up. However, this is a huge turn off because I’d like to be able to see real change from him then make a sound decision."

Dated for 3 years and married for 7.
She is beautiful and amazing person and everyone in my family loves her.

4 months ago I found out my wife was having affair with a mutual friend of ours.
It was a one and half month affair, she was acting very shady at that time, she would ignore my messages, turn me down everytime I try to initiate sex. I thought something was wrong. I did snooping but found nothing, eventually I hired a PI within 1 week I got proofs. She was having affair with our mutual friend. I immediately confronted her, she confessed having affair. immediately she started Crying, begging. Basically all classic cheater moves when they are caught..

I asked her for all details, with detailed timeline, at night gave me everything basically she was using another phone for having affair. She told me she had sex with him only 4 time and rest of time they were just hanging out and having fun.

3 days later More crying and talking crap about her self she told me that she had deleted all contracts with him and do whatever it takes to make our marriage work, she suggested MC. I denied, told her to leave me alone. I was hurt, betrayed, humiliated. She moved out to her parents. 

She started  texting me every hour how much she loves me and how she regrets this, and will do anything to save our marriage. 
After completely ignoring her for 2 days. I texted her that we are getting divorce. She freaked out and started having emotions breakdown, my phone started blowing up with her parents, sister, friends 
Telling me not to end marriage and atleast give her a chance.

Later that day she made a long post on FB explaining how she fucked up and how she is destroyed her marriage, basically admitting her affair publically.

But I was rock solid on my decision. She even insisted to have a lie detector test to clear my doubts, that she never cheated In the past. Bla bla 
Bla. I asked her for some time alone to process all this. We have been living separate since.
This was all 4 months ago 

Last week I asked her for divorce and she started Crying, begging for another chance. After that she visited my parents and asked them to convince me not to divorce.
Last night my parents and her parents tried to convince me to work things out. And after she made her FB post almost all of our mutual friends were telling me how she was brave to admit her affair 
And that she loves me and I should atleast give her a chance. I'm on an edge of having a breakdown, she is truly remorseful and regrets this I can assure you this. I do love her and her cheating on me hurts the most. I don't know what to do!
Anyone who has reconciled how are things going on?

*Small update* - 
First of thanks to each and everyone of you 
The amount of support I got in last 15hr was unbelievable, I'm sorry I couldn't reply to your comments, and PM I'm trying to answer some common questions

- We don't have kids, we were planning to have kids after this pandemics was over.
- We both own a business and, we work together
- I haven't talked to her in almost 3 months, only buisness related stuff.

Here's the update.
After reading all your comment and PM's I decided,
Talk to my parents, 
I called the, and told them that I was going for divorce.
After an hour later she called me crying, not to end it.
And told me to atleast meet her in person, since the Dday I haven't seen her or talked about affair. Everytime I talked I ignored the talk about affair.  
She told me she'll explain everything, Atleast hear her side of story and after hearing it whatever decision I'll take she'll respect that. Since I don't know what was going on and don't have much information about the Affair, it will be like closure to me  
So I've decided to mee her on Sunday.
That's it nothing dramatic."
a5nqpf,My (23f) special needs brother (28m) is a savant with mixing beats.

My older brother Timothy has severe autism and will never be able to be his own legal entity so as of right now, my parents have legal guardianship over him. I love Timothy so much and when my parents pass I will become his legal guardian per thier trust.

Timothy is absolute savant when it comes to mixing beats. They are true pieces of art but the way he wants is that they stay his. He has sold a few with the consent of my parents to national advertising companies and made a decent amount of money that went into his trust.

I also have a younger brother who is the literal spoiled golden child of the family. We have never gotten along and I barely have even brotherly love for him. He had gotten into the Christian rock genere and since he has a great voice and is a decent guitar player has found a decent amount of success with paid gigs at mega churches in our region.

Well recently my younger brother wrote a new song that has really taken off on Christian radio and in August he was signed to a really large (for the genre) contract with a Christian recording house. The problem is, younger bro literally stole one of Timothy’s favorite beats for the hook to his song. It’s so blatent as to be undeniable. M

Timothy is crushed over this because the beat in question was one of his favorites and he wanted to keep it his forever. I think at the very least he deserves a song writer credit and some of the money from the contract since the cat is out of the bag. Younger brother refuses to do any of this and claims it’s his song. 

I’ve talked to my parents and a. They tell me to stay out of it since they are Timothy’s legal guardians it’s thier choice and b. Accuse me of being jealous of younger brothers success and trying to ruin his career. I am FURIOUS with my parents and brother and don’t know what to do. It’s so unfair I can’t even sleep at night.

What should or can I do here?"

I left of without saying anything and follows me to beg jme for forgiveness, and another chance saying she will do anything to fix it. And it was a one time mistake , she was drunk,and she wouldn't do that while sober and she's very sorry. I am numb, heartbroken my mind is all over the place , since we live together, I leave her and in the house,asks for some space and come back home in later in the afternoon the following day. She goes to pick something up from the kitchen and a message pops up on her phone and its my friend , making fun of me and asking how I bought her BS. I go through the messages and I find out about their affair which has been going on for a month. I confront her and admits to cheating. She then broke down crying, saying she's sorry that it didn't mean anything that she was lonely because I work a lot and she wanted to break it off, she only loves me , blah blah.  

I love her very much , I love her mom and younger sister,  my parents love her but I broke up with her and gave her 2 months to move , I quit the team and I have started the process of moving out. The thing is she's an exchange student, her mother is a widow and I have been financially supporting her as well as paying for her college. My parents wants me to forgive her and her mom also wants me to forgive her , because to them she just made a mistake and was immature and she also deals with chronic depression. She is one of those wonderful ,extra caring , hyper sensitive women who almost everyone likes.

We met through an internship in university (she came from Korea, i came from Canada), we ended up both doing a long distance relationship thing for a year before we both ended up moving to Toronto for jobs as developers. 

To make things complicated her family has never really approved of me. I know very basic Korean that she taught me, but her family up until now has cut contact with me (they didn't come to the wedding, nor have they seen their grand daugthers). However she has always been extremely independent, and despises the idea that her family can control any part of her life, so she asked me to marry her (i was fine with that) only after living together for 8 months. 

Two years ago she gave birth to a pair of wonderful baby girls. However it became very obvious something was extremely wrong, she became a whole different kind of person after the birth. She became extremely protective and borderline paranoid of anyone other than me or her looking after her kids. 

Apparently the idea of her becoming a stay at home mom was insulting to her and she told me over and over that i needed to become a stay at home dad. Since she was the bread winner it was fine for me. About 6 months ago she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and was given medication that made her much better (no more bizarre mood swings, or picking fights for no reason). 

Last weekend was the first time i have had some time off from the kids, i was going to my friends bachelor party at his cottage for the weekend and my wife was going to look after the kids. 

On Sunday morning i got a phone call from my sister who told me:

* My wife dropped the kids off with her as there was some emergency at the office on Saturday.
* She didn't come back to get them and it was now Sunday
* Her phone wasn't responding to her messages/calls. 

I freaked out and rushed home, only to find pretty much all her stuff gone. She left me a single page note that was basically told me that she was going back home to be with her family, and she was ""cutting ties"" with me as she couldn't be the person ""i wanted her to be"", and asked that i respect her decision. She also closed our joint bank accounts saying i had ""no right"" to that money as she earned it. 

I talked to one of her friends from work and she said she told me she put in her two weeks notice over a month ago so this has been planned for awhile.

I am pretty much a confused mess, my family is helping out, but its complicated. I talked to her parents and they basically refused to talk to me, and demanded that i leave her or them alone. I brought up their grand-children and her father told me point blank they aren't his.

What am i supposed to be doing. I don't really understand. 

TLDR; Wife ditched me and our kids, took our money and went back to Korea. I can't get in touch with her at all and this was all planned way in advance."
14npvha,I (39M) found out I'm the literal backup to my pregnant fiancée (32F) and walked out. She's begging me to go back - not sure what to do?,6152,0.78,1399,2023-07-01 14:06:45,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14npvha/i_39m_found_out_im_the_literal_backup_to_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14npvha/i_39m_found_out_im_the_literal_backup_to_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,5,,text,False,,False,"Bit of very relevant back history. 

We first met 6 years ago in my then job and we were just colleagues then. I split up with my ex 4 years ago roughly and we started seeing each other casually 3 years ago until she asked me if we could give it a go as a serious relationship just over 2 years ago. A lot has happened in the past 2 years - she had a preventive double mastectomy due to having the breast cancer gene, we both sold our respective houses, moved in together, got pregnant and I proposed 6 months ago. She has been telling me in the past few months she's so in love with me, can't wait to start our family and even wants more kids with me - we only planned to have the one but because she's so happy, we were even saying she was thinking about having another kid straight after our first is born so we could start our family before she has a hysterectomy due to the gene. 

So she went on maternity last week and we have 2 weeks to go before our child is born. Sods law said my phone died a few of days ago so I asked her if I could use of her old ones until my new one came - she said of course and told me which one and said it should be empty really. Important thing to note here is that she actually has 2 of the same make but different models so by mistake, I grabbed the wrong one and logged in and said oh I thought it was blank. She said without thinking she must be baby brained again so to do what I want and delete anything I don't need. 

After a short while, I start going through the phone and see she has conversations with her bestie in there and the last dates were just before we committed to each other. Basically, she was talking to her and literally weighing all her options up about having kids with before it's too late and she was going over her ""backups"" and I saw their chat about me. Basically the consensus was I was the shortest and oldest of her guys she was seeing but I had the best prospects - most stable job, best personality, most common interests, funny, good in bed and good looking even if I'm not her usual type. So she said she was going to give it a go and her friend encouraged her. Then I guess we started dating, the messages stopped when she was starting to go through her mastectomies and got a new phone. 

I just went like ""what the fuck babe"" out loud and she initially was clueless but realised what phone I had. She was mortified and she was spiralling trying to explain herself but not making much sense. I literally told her to shut up, grabbed my stuff and walked out. I've booked into a BnB and have been staying here for a couple of days. She's been messaging me, sending video messages literally begging me to come home crying so we can talk. I can't face it. 

I feel so fucking humiliated and used. I've gone from the happiest I've been in years to feeling like my last couple of years is a bit of a lie. I keep going through the messages on one hand and thinking of the way she's been in the past few months on the other - telling me how much she's in love with me, how happy she is, she wouldn't change the past couple of years and how much she's looking forward to starting a family with me. Saying things like she has an actual crush on me. Even just sends me texts with a love heart on. 

I literally don't know what to do. Do I go back and talk? Or wait it out until she has the baby then go back and discuss it then? I am a literal mess Reddit. 

Tldr; pregnant fiancée let me use her old phone and I discovered chats in it basically going over my Pros and cons as a backup before she started going out with me. I walked out feeling humiliated and don't know what to do.

Edited to add an update you're all right, I shouldn't just walk out and leave her while she's so vulnerable. I'm going to go home at least and be with her until the baby is here and we'll see what happens there. Can't say I know long term how I'll feel and what will happen or that I'm that happy but will tackle that when it comes."

My husband, I'll call him Eric, has always been a really intense person but he's a good man.  When we got together I noticed he had a much higher sex drive than I did, but I would usually have sex with him when I wasn't in mood anyway because I love him.  He's never vocalized any problems until somewhat recently. 

I should also mention, just before we got married we talked about having kids. I'm indifferent to kids whereas he doesn't want them, so agreed not to have them. 

Over the last year my sex drive has been almost non existent. I've been checked by doctors and they say nothing is wrong physically but I should talk to a therapist, which I haven't done yet. I haven't even been able to just have sex with him to have sex like I was doing. 

About 4 months ago he sat me down and we talked about all this and he said he needs sex, which I told him I understood but I can't give that to him right now. We argued for a bit and he ended up sleeping on the couch. In the morning he suggested we open the relationship. I was heartbroken. 

He explained that we either give this a try or end the relationship. So I agreed. We set boundaries: no bringing the person to our house ever, no talking about it, always use protection and regularly get tested. He agreed to all of this. 

I was actually surprised how okay I was with this as the months moved along. Even when he'd text me that he's going to be late, or when he'd kiss me and tell me has plans that night. It almost felt like a burden was lifted from me. 

Well yesterday my husband sat me down again and said he something really difficult to tell me. For the last couple of months he's been seeing this one girl and she's pregnant.  I think I dissociated a little because I heard him talking but couldn't understand the words he was saying. When I came back to reality I asked if it was his and is she keeping it. Yes and yes. And he plans on being in this child's life actively. I asked him who she was and he told me. It's someone I know, not well but I do know who she is. 

I'm utterly heartbroken. I haven't told family or friends yet, I asked him not to. I asked him if he wants a divorce, he didn't say no. He's basically leaving it up to me.

So I guess my question is, do I cut my losses and move on or give this marriage another try?

I posted an update if anyone wants to know how our conversation went.  [Update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/15wd6ux/update_husband_30m_and_i_28f_opened_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)"

Around the time we've hit the 5 year mark on our relationship, it's gotten increasingly toxic. We keep fighting about everything, she keeps calling me names (dickhead, pussy, etc.), it's just not been good. I decided that we need to break up.

And that's where the problem started. It's been almost 2 years now that I've been trying to break up with her. But every time I mention or we get to that after a fight, she starts going on about she's just gonna kill herself since I wronged her and that it's my fault and that everyone's gonna find out what a POS I am when she's gone. She keeps sending me crying voice messages, it's just nonstop. Even through all her bullying me, I still love her. I just don't want her to kill herself. I couldn't live with myself if she actually did it. I'm just... broken. I can't sleep, I've lost all my confidence, I can't concentrate. Because this basically happens every week.

When she starts going about doing it, I always tell her that I'm gonna call the cops or her mom. And she sends a photo of a window in a high floor saying that she's gonna jump if I do that, or a photo of a knife put against her forearm saying that she will cut herself and end it. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I know that I can't continue like this, I'm absolutely destroyed. But I just don't want her to die. What should I do?"

Thank you all for your wonderful support, anyways i have tried my best to follow everyone's advice. 

I sat down with my SO and explained to her how awesome she, is and explained how i don't have any romantic feelings for my ex at all, all i really have is a lot of painful and hurtful memories. I also asked her what should i do, and she suggested i respond and tell her off, to get closure of some degree.

So i did that, i told her:

* I don't want to be friends anymore
* I want nothing to do with her
* I explained how badly she hurt me
* I am happy right now and i just want her to leave me and my friends alone

She took it well, apologized one more time and then basically said ""goodbye forever"". That was honestly a huge load off my shoulders. 

I then went and told our group of friends, and explained how much she hurt me, and how i would rather we not start adding her to our gaming sessions etc. 

Unfortunately i ended up losing a bunch of friends and have irreparably caused a lot of damage to our friends group. Many of them sided with me, but a bunch of them took the stance of ""You have no right to tell me who i can be friends with"" among other complaints. A few people were very angry, and told me i am being a terrible person as my EX is trying to repent, and deal with pain of her divorce. It was confusing and frankly just made everything more of a mess. 

In the end, a bunch of us ended up getting booted out of our FF14 free company, which then my SO ended up kicking out of bunch of people from our discord. I don't really know what is going to happen.  But it really hurt to see some people i have known for years, and even helped me get through it the first time suddenly take her side.

TLDR; Told my ex off, explained to people in our group of friends how she hurt me, it ended up breaking our circle of friends."

I had proposed to my girlfriend of three years as a surprise while we were out skiing. It didnt go like I had thought it would. She said no. She wasnt comfortable because we hadn't talked about everything yet and we were still working on things. And you shouldn't pop a life changing question on someone and expect them to answer right away if you haven't previously had serious conversations about it.

Well on December 2nd, 2018, I asked my girlfriend again if she would marry me. I asked her while snowshoeing this time. She said yes!!! We are now engaged and happily looking towards the future. 
Thank you to everyone on reddit who gave me constructive feedback and realistic viewpoints. "
i3xhoe,"My boyfriend's friend filmed his girlfriend without her knowing and showed his friends.

I just learned about this and reacted with disgust. (Edit: the filming happened 25 years ago and he showed it to his friends immediately after). My boyfriend said it was a bad thing to do but the filming and showing of non-consensual porn by his friend should be forgiven because ""he was in his 20s and stupid"" and that ""the girl never knew/will never know"". 

I said his reasoning was terrible and felt sorry for the poor girl, and asked if I told him that someone in their 20s filmed me unknowingly and showed it to all his friends, would he say the same thing to me (that the guy was 20 and stupid), and he told me to get off my high horse and that his friend is a great guy.

His friend now seems like a decent person and has a loving family. He's done other awful things in his past e.g. invited his friends to hide in his closet while he had sex with someone without her knowing. My boyfriend said he hid because he didn't believe he would actually do it, and when the sex started happening he turned away. I guess I believe my boyfriend but it makes me very uncomfortable. 

I know this was 25 years ago and people change. He friend does seem like a decent person now. But I'm upset my boyfriend isn't as disapproving of this and got annoyed at me for being upset by it. Am I overreacting?

Edit: his friend's actions are unforgivable and from other things my now ex has told me and how people have made me question them, i do not believe he is a decent man from what i know of him. 

- As a victim of abuse i thought i would be smart enough to recognise it, i wasn't. thank you to everyone who has comforted me and offered me advice. this has gone beyond my original post but i realise his issues are much deeper than this and I'm overwhelmed. i won't be seeing him again, i will be looking at therapy."
bh4qad,My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),6067,0.96,673,2019-04-25 10:31:48,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,True,False,False,"**TLDR; I went through my sister's texts and found out she was sleeping with my stepdad. My mom is at my aunts house now and I don't know where my stepdad and sister are. I don't know what to do or think about all of this.**

Throwaway account because I don't want this awful part of my life on my main account. Don't really care if my sister ends up seeing it because there's obviously nothing here that she doesn't already know!!

The title is pretty self explanatory. I'm still processing everything so I apologize if this post is a mess. Some context: my sister and I have different dads (my mom has been married twice, had my sister out of wedlock). My dad died when I was 11 and my mom married my stepdad 2 years later.

I came home pretty high last night around 1am thinking everyone was asleep. I was about to walk into the kitchen but jumped half a foot because my stepdad was standing there in the dark leaning over the sink. He had to have heard me but didn't turn around, and being there kind of creeped me out so I went upstairs. I heard someone throwing up in the bathroom and when I looked out the window I didn't see my sisters car (she moved out but ran out of money half a year ago and moved back into the basement) so I knew it was my mom in the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure she was okay but she didn't answer and I could hear her crying. I assumed she wanted to be alone and I figured me being high off my ass wasn't going to help so I just went to bed.

When I came downstairs this morning I couldn't find anyone, and there's usually someone there to drive me to school (I'm in high school, don't drive, and live out of district). We never leave later than 7 but I still couldn't find anyone by 7:30 and no one was answering my calls/texts. I still felt weird about last night but thought maybe it just seemed weird because I was baked and tired but it was obvious at that point that something was going on.

I got a text from my mom around 8 saying she was sorry but everyone is okay and she'll write me a note for school tomorrow. She wouldn't tell me what was going on but my sister ended up coming home looking like shit. Whenever I tried asking her what was going on she'd either ignore me or tell me to fuck off, and she was frantically going into the basement and bringing up her things and putting them in her car.

I could tell she was disoriented and at one point she left her phone on the kitchen table and went to the bathroom. I grabbed her phone (yeah yeah I know reddit is judgmental about that shit and I get it but I had no idea what was going on with my family and I was so worried I felt sick) and saw she had been texting my mom apologizing over and over and saying she knows that she's a slut and said something about how Shaun (our stepdad) isn't even related to her and that it ""wasn't as many times as you think."" I don't remember exactly what else she said because I only pulled random words from it before my sister came out and saw me but I pieced two and two together. She ripped the phone out of my hand so hard her nail cut my thumb and when I asked if she fucked Shaun she didn't answer and got in her car and left.

I was shaking like crazy and felt like I was going to be sick. I couldn't stand being in our house alone so I got my boyfriend to leave school during lunch and come get me. I've been at his house since and haven't heard from anyone all day except for my aunt (mom's sister) who texted me asking where I was. She said my mom was staying with her and wanted to make sure I was safe and told me to just stay at my bfs if I could.

I don't know what the fuck to do in this situation. I'm so grossed out and I can't help but think about all the signs and ways that we didn't notice. Like I said my sister moved into the basement and my stepdad's office is down there, none of us have a reason to go down there aside from doing laundry so it very well could have happened there.

An hour or two ago I started freaking out because I remembered a few weeks ago I went to my sister's friend's house with her and they were asking me if I've started watching porn yet. My sister brought up all this stuff she had saved on her phone and most of it was shit like ""sexy stepdaughter caught masturbating"" or ""stepdaughter begging for cock"" or something like that idk. I asked her why she watches stuff like that and she told me to ignore the titles, if you turn the sound off the story doesn't matter... When I brought it up with my bf he said that there's a lot of that kind of stuff going around right now and some people do watch it for the visuals and ignore the title/context. But he agrees that it's probably too much of a coincidence.

For a bunch of unrelated reasons my mom and I have both had kind of a bad relationship with my sister for a long time, but since she moved back in we've been working really hard to improve things with her and I finally started to feel like we were real sisters. I really want to believe that it was all my stepdad taking advantage of her (that sounds bad when I type it out but I just can't understand why she'd do this to my mom) but with the porn and stuff idk. Plus she was apologizing to my mom a lot and my mom didn't seem to be answering her. My sister was already in college when my mom met Shaun so maybe he never thought of her as a kid?

I really don't know if he's the kind of person who does this (I mean I know he did, but yeah I don't know the full story yet) because to be honest I just don't know him that well. He married my mom pretty soon after my dad died and I don't think any of us were ready but my mom was lonely. I don't know what she sees in him, he's pretty boring and works a lot and just watches sports and stuff but he never struck me as being a bad person.

This is getting rambly and I don't know what details are important so I'm sorry if parts don't make sense. I just needed to get it out and see if anyone else has gone through this or has any suggestions about what to do? Is this a common thing that happens??

My boyfriend thinks I should give my mom space even though I want to comfort her because we're both still processing it. I don't know where my stepdad and sister are and I kind of want to know but also really don't.

\---

Edit: I couldn't find the edit option earlier, so I put a response in the comments. Please read it before commenting (Is there a way I can pin my own comment below?)

Edit edit: I realize now based off of the comments that I didn't explain this very well: my sister and I have different dads. My mom had my sister when she was really young/not married, then married my dad and had me, and then married Shaun. Shaun is technically my sister's stepdad too, but she refuses to call him that. She had already moved out and wasn't really around when he was dating my mom and moved in, so he's even less of a father figure to her than he is to me (he really isn't like a dad to me and we aren't close at all, but calling him my stepdad is just easier and technically correct)."
ik2ou3,My husband doesn't like me wearing a _sleep_ mask to bed and I have no idea why.,6065,1.0,361,2020-08-31 23:13:49,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ik2ou3/my_husband_doesnt_like_me_wearing_a_sleep_mask_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ik2ou3/my_husband_doesnt_like_me_wearing_a_sleep_mask_to/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"(I've never posted anything before and made an account to make this post because I don't know what to do in this situation. **I originally wrote this for** r/AmItheAsshole **but now it seems like it would be better here.**)

Background: I (22f) met my husband, 'Nick' (37m) three years ago, and initially things were wonderful. He was a perfect gentleman and treated me like a princess; I had just escaped an abusive relationship when we met so I was overjoyed to finally be with a man who appreciated me. We got married in August 2019 and began trying for a baby. I should also mention that we live in the UK.

I'm currently 8.5 months pregnant with twins, so on top of everything going on in the world, this year has been hard for me. I'm a very petite woman (4'11, 95lbs pre-baby) so the pregnancy has taken a toll on my body and I'll admit I've been a nightmare to be around, but Nick hasn't made it any easier. He has a stressful job and takes out his frustrations on me. He blows up when I don't have dinner ready on time and has called me a bitch/a nag when I complain about him leaving messes around the house.

I tried to ignore him but snapped back when he began targeting my appearance. Most days he makes fun of my breakouts or my gross hair or my 'disgusting ankles'. The worst insults are about my belly and how fat I am now and how I look like a whale (which is true, but it stings hearing it from someone you love).

I figured getting more sleep would help me feel better about myself; I'm always tired but the bump means it's hard to get comfy, and Nick likes the blinds open so it's never properly dark. My sister suggested wearing a sleepmask at night and it really helped. It's pink and has fluffy cat ears and cat eyes and I think it's so cute.

Nick hates it. He says it's creepy and that he doesn't like me wearing it and he won't tell me why. If I'm wearing it in bed when he gets up he won't kiss me good morning or talk to me until I take it off, which hurts because I need his support. We're going to be parents in a couple of weeks and I've considered throwing it out to keep the peace, but it really helps me sleep. How should I approach this?"

I ended up moving back home with my parents. I completely cut contact with both Victoria and my ex, and the last I heard of them was that they had started dating when I moved home.

In the past six years, I met someone new and we’ve been married for just under a year now. My husband (28) knows all about what happened between Victoria/my ex. Last Saturday, my Husband’s best friend (Julian (28)) invited us out for lunch because he wanted to introduce us to his new girlfriend. Well, his new girlfriend is Victoria. Victoria spent the whole lunch gushing about how much she missed me and telling Julian all of the good memories we had had together. She made it seem like we had just drifted apart after I moved, instead of her betraying me. Julian is a really nice guy and I didn’t want to hurt him by making a scene so I ended up faking sick so I could leave early.

When we got home my husband asked if I wanted him to tell Julian what happened but I’m not sure if that would be fair to him. I know people can change but seeing her again just brought the betrayal and hurt all back again.

How do I deal with having to see her again?

TL;DR – My husband’s best friend is dating my former best friend who slept with my (ex)boyfriend. I’m over it/him but seeing her again brought all of the old hurt back again."

Wife and I have been married for 10 years, great relationship that I put down to us always being open & honest with each other. We’d always said that if the opportunity for a threesome with another man came up we would like to go for it. Last weekend we met a guy at the bar of a hotel we were staying in and ended up in our bedroom. To begin with it was great but I came first and basically watched them go at it for the next 20 minutes. He had her in positions I’ve never even seen and I know she came at least twice. It didn’t bother me at the time and afterwards we agreed it was fun and that we had no regrets. For the past week my wife has had a spring in her step - she’s happy and confident and deep down I know it’s because she realises that she can still get the interest of a good looking younger man. I on the other hand have done nothing but relive the second half of the night over and over in my head. I’ve never heard her like she was that night and I know that I’ll never satisfy her like that. I’d love to tell her how I’m feeling and I know that she would understand. But I don’t want her to feel like she has to start faking things and over actin in order to make me feel good but I know that’s exactly what she will do. I’m hoping if I say nothing my anxiety will fade. Any advice??"

bicdpm,My friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry her and I'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. Do I say anything?,6010,0.98,449,2019-04-28 20:58:33,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Not sure if this belongs in this sub because it isn't my relationship I'm asking for advice about. If not, apologies. 

Tldr: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend of 6 years to marry him, and I'm the only one who knows the truth about how unfaithful she's been to him. He's completely blinded by love and to him she can do no wrong. I know it might not be my place to say anything but I don't want him to make a huge mistake.

So my good friend ""Aaron"" and his girlfriend ""Mary"" have been together for almost 7 years. They meet in college and are in a very close relationship. Personally I would call them extremely codependent. Neither of them really have any friends aside from each other. She doesn't let him have guy friends. In fact she doesn't let him do a lot of things. He's not allowed to go out past 11, not allowed to drink or smoke, she has to approve of all of his friends, and he's not allowed to be alone with other girls. She's got this guy on a tight leash. 

The reason why they're still together is that Aaron is completely whipped, and to him she can do no wrong. He talks regularly about how amazed he still is that she finds him attractive. (He's a decent looking guy, but she's like super model level good looking) 
They post cutesy couple photos every day (im pretty sure she makes him post them) and to everyone who sees them they appear to be the perfect magical fairytale couple.

Anyway a few weeks ago he told my boyfriend and I that he was planning on proposing to Mary. Of course we congratulated him because he seemed super excited. 

Now here’s the issue: a few weeks prior to this, I hung out with a friend of Mary- ""Alison"". Alison told me about a party they went to where Mary got drunk and slept with her ex. After the party they began hooking up regularly, and she had a threesome with him and a friend of his. Aaron has no knowledge of these hookups. 

I told my boyfriend about it because he shares my friendship with both of them, and he believes that we need to say something but I'm not so sure how to even go about that. It will destroy him, ruin their entire relationship and maybe a friendship as well. However I think in the long term he will be unhappy with a marriage where she's so controlling. Not even that, but if she's completely okay with cheating on her long term partner it will be the same once they're married. 

Is telling him the right thing to do?

Edit: to clarify, the cheating has not been going on for 6 years (as far as I’m aware) and the hookups occurred recently.

Edit 2: some of the commenters are calling me a bad friend for not telling him immediately. After giving it some thought and reading the comments, I have decided to tell him as soon as I can, most likely tonight if he’s free to hang out. To those saying I’m being a bad friend for waiting: this is a huge deal, and it will greatly affect the future of Aaron, and I want to make sure I break the news in the correct way. This man is blinded by love. He’s not going to be expecting this news at all and his whole life is about to change. I’m definitely not going to do nothing, because he deserves much better than this woman, and he deserves to know the truth about what he’s getting into if he still decides to marry her. I’m expecting a full blown shit storm, I’m expecting him to be hurt, angry, in disbelief. I don’t believe it’s wrong that I’m asking for a bit of advice on how to approach this. Should I have told him sooner? Maybe, but what difference would a few weeks make? For all those asking, I’ll post an update when I do it.

Edit 3: I've talked to Aaron since I posted this and he is coming over tonight to talk/hang out. My bf and I are going to tell him together because he knows the situation as well. A few of you have suggested I talk to Mary first to give her a chance to come clean. While that's a good idea, I'm not as close to her as I am to Aaron, and I don't see that going over well. I would much rather tell him and leave it to him to decide what to do from there

Edit 4: new information has been received from the third party friend Alison. She has sent me screenshots of texts that do prove Mary has been involved with her ex. They send messages regularly and he has sent her nudes.

Edit 5: lmao I’ll just mention that Aaron just got to our house (8:00pm EST) will update later if I can. Thank you all so much for the kind messages and helping me work this hot mess out. Ive been stressing about this all day but I believe I am doing the right thing in telling him.

Edit 6: quick little edit. (11:00 EST) We all talked for a good bit, I told him what I heard from Alison and it went better than expected, but he was still pretty mad and upset. We are all just chilling and drinking now- I’ll post the whole story tomorrow. Thanks again for all the replies!"

Her new job requires her to attend a 3 month training course on a campus in a different part of the country. She’s 2 weeks into this course and she’s just told me that she’s ending our relationship because she’s started fucking another trainee. This means I now have to move out of our apartment because I can’t afford to live here by myself (whereas she can). 

So I’ve lost my girlfriend and my apartment and naturally I’m pretty pissed. However I know that the training course she is on has a strict ‘no relationship’ policy amongst trainees, and is punishable by exclusion from the course. I’m contemplating sending an email to the company explaining the situation. I don’t have any proof but I’m sure if they monitored her she would get caught out soon enough and sent home. 

I don’t know whether or not to do it. I feel like she has just ruined my life, and as much as I’d like to walk away from this situation, part of me wants to get some payback. 

What do you guys think? Dick move or karma?

UPDATE: You’re all as indecisive as I am.  I’m going day drinking with my Dad and will likely discuss this at length. Will update later with my decision for anyone who gives a shit. (Thanks to those who have left kind words, I appreciate it. The aggressive comments have made me laugh too so cheers.)

UPDATE 2: A lot of you guys asked for an update so here it is. Despite a lot of convincing posts, I’m not going to do it. She needed a lot of support to get to this point (financial, emotional and otherwise) and without it I think she’s perfectly capable of fucking up this opportunity by herself. I’m going to keep the apartment, even if it means I have to leave down the line. I want to put her through the stress of finding somewhere new to live whilst out of the city. 

Thanks for all the kind messages (and the edgy ones). A lot of you guys are wise as fuck and gave some good advice. Sorry to everyone that wanted revenge, perfectly ready for you guys to call me boring or a pussy or whatever. 

Life goes on ✌️"

I have no idea where to start with the events that have occurred within the past 11 hours since i last   posted. I am still shaken up and this is hard to process. 

My bf finally messaged me back a few hours after i asked him to meet up with me. He agreed to meet me at his apartment. I made sure that i was going to talk to his dad before him so he could help me find the correct course of action for my bf. 

Well i met with the father (we will call him X). I was so scared before talking to X that i was shaking. My voice was unsteady and i had tears in my eyes when i walked in. I had no idea where to begin. X looked concerned so he sat us down across from each other. I told X that i believe his son has been sexually abused for 6 years now. Of course, X was taken aback. I started to tell him about what my bf told me. That’s when X started to be more and more puzzled. He stopped me while telling the story i knew about my bf and his mother. X told me that there’s no way this is completely true. When he says this i start getting confused as well. X tells me that my bfs mother died in a car accident when  he was 8. X never remarried or had a gf. At this point i am dumbfounded and i have no idea what to say. 

X tells me that he didn’t think my bfs mother was sexually abusive while she was alive or why my bf would even tell me this. X also tells me that he have no idea who “mom” might be on his phone. I take a few minutes to calm down and think before i head over to my bf’s apartment.

The drive was only 10ish minutes from X’s House to my bf’s. I took this time to process what X told me and what i would say to my bf. When i got to the apartment i promptly went inside. I demanded answers immediately. I asked the truth about his mother, the messages i saw, and if they’ve really been having sex since he was 13. Of course he apologized again and gave me the same story but it made me angry. This is where i lost my cool.

I yelled and told him that X told me that his biological mother had been dead for almost 11 years. I told him i knew there was no way the story he told me was true because his mother passed when he was 8 years old. My bf became silent and looked down. At this point i was crying uncontrollably. I felt so bad for what happened and i wanted to get him therapy. I was willing to forgive him for keeping the secret from me. My bf was silent for a few minutes then finally spoke to me. He told me he made the whole story up. The contact he had as “mom” was an ex girlfriend he regularly hooked up with. She was 20 and a bartender in our city. He put her name as mom so i wouldn’t get suspicious that he was talking to another woman so often. He didn’t think i would find out so he fabricated the whole story up. This way, i wouldn’t be mad at him. He told me he figured i would feel sorry for him and stay with him. 

I felt so betrayed when he confessed this. In past few days i went from having a healthy relationship to thinking my bf had been sexually abused by his mother then to find out it was all a lie just because he didn’t want me to know he was sleeping with this ex. He tried to justify it further, telling me it was meaningless and he only loved me. I told my bf that i want nothing to do with him and left. He tried to follow and plead with me but i ignored him. I drove home, threw out all everything he gave me, and blocked him (once again.) 

I cannot believe he lied about something so major just to protect himself. I haven’t stopped crying  since i left his apartment. I’m so hurt and now i don’t know what to do. I no longer want him in my life. I’m considering moving towns so he can’t find me. He has gotten online and used a fake number to try and get ahold of me to apologize. I need to clear my head and try to take everything in. I will turn off my phone and computer for a while so he can’t try to contact me again. 


[UPDATE:] So my now ex-bf came to my apartment and started banging on the door, begging to be let in so we could talk. At this point i have turned all the lights off. I am being quiet so he will hopefully leave. I know he can see my car out front so it’s obvious that i am here still. I want to call the cops but i am not sure there’s much they can do. I’m thinking about going back to live with my parents until this blows over with him. I am also considering talking to his ex that he was hooking up with. I got her full name and where she works. I will keep updates as i learn more about my ex-bf.

[UPDATE #2:] I am having a lot of people send me messages so thank you for the kind words! I can’t reply to everyone’s messages so at the bottom of the comments I added some additional commentary on everyone’s suspicions. Please read it to answer any questions if you’re still unsure. Please note that there are some personal details i left out in order to keep privacy! (Ex. How his mother died) There’s a reason he didn’t talk about it.

honmy1,My girlfriend is less attracted to me after finding out about my trauma. Idk what to do.,5975,0.96,576,2020-07-10 17:27:29,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/honmy1/my_girlfriend_is_less_attracted_to_me_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/honmy1/my_girlfriend_is_less_attracted_to_me_after/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"(TW: sexual assault/rape and mental health discussions) 

So yeah. This has been really fucking with my head for the past few days. Idk what to do moving forwards here. 

The trauma in question is that from ages 12-17 I was sexually abused by my cousin who is a year older than me and at one point also by his girlfriend at the time. It only stopped when it did because he moved to a different country to go to university and I only actually told anyone when I was 19 (I'm 23 now, for reference). It obviously took a toll on my mental health and ages 16-20 I had a heavy drinking problem. I rarely drink at all any more and when I do it's even more rare that I actually get drunk. 

I've been with my girlfriend for about a year now. I didn't tell her about what had happened to me straight away because honestly, I absolutely hate talking about it/acknowledging that it happened and rarely do so outside of my therapist's office. However, about six months ago she and I went to a wedding and both got drunk. The wedding was in my family and something was said that - for want of a better word - triggered me big time and that, coupled with me being drunk, led to me breaking down in tears and telling her what happened. At the time she seemed sympathetic, though I did notice she became a little more...standoffish?? Like, she wasn't mean or cold or anything. She was just less forthcoming with physical affection and stuff. I didn't think too much of it because I get it, finding out something like that can be hard and I figured she needed time to process it. That only lasted a month or two, and then things went back to normal. No harm done. 

At least that's what I thought. Over this past weekend, I dropped my phone and broke it. I'm due an upgrade soon anyway, so we elected that, in the meantime, I'll just use her old phone as a stand in since she upgraded last month and her ""old"" phone is still pretty new. She didn't wipe the phone before giving it to me so it still had some of her photos, messages etc on it. Including texts to her best friend, from as recently as five weeks ago, where she confessed that she's just less attracted to me now that she knows about what happened to me as a teenager. The message thread included things like ""it's sad, but I just don't know if I can be attracted to him anymore"" and ""I know it sounds bad but I just don't know how I feel about being with a guy who got fucked by another guy"" and ""I just don't get how he let it happen, like if it was an adult I'd understand but it was another kid???"" 

I haven't confronted her about it yet, but reading those messages made me feel so upset and sick. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell her and I wish I hadn't now. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do moving forward to get over this???"

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Woah, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to crawl into a hole after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. I wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""I love that dress! You look really good!"" We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. (For those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how I asked him out). Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me. Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what has happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

1cp52e7,My Husband (M39) has improved himself in every way over the past few years and now I am petrified he will leave me.  How can I feel secure in a marriage where I (F38) am the “worst” one in every way?,5953,0.96,975,2024-05-11 06:18:10,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cp52e7/my_husband_m39_has_improved_himself_in_every_way/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cp52e7/my_husband_m39_has_improved_himself_in_every_way/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"Background:

In the beginning of our relationship 12 years ago he was a chubby nerd with a kind heart.  I was in OK shape with a few extra pounds on my mid section and we were happy.  He is in manufacturing and I’m in marketing.  He dropped out of college and I have my bachelors with multiple professional certifications.  I have always made more than double what he did.  I didn’t really care but it would bug him at times.  He always insisted on doing the cooking, cleaning, and laundry to make up for it which I thought was cute but insisted wasn’t necessary.  We could always afford a modest lifestyle and since marriage have pooled our finances.  As we grew our lives together we both put on weight and he put all his career ambitions on hold to support my dreams and climbing the corporate ladder.  We have 2 kids and he has done almost all the daycare, sports, school, doctors, and play date chauffeuring since they’ve been born.  Honestly he has taken on far too much for the sake of my busy career and his just stagnated as a result.  He only kept the job for the flexibility it affords him as a dad.  It was the balance we struck and we were happy.  Before COVID he was  making 40k while I was at 120k with bonuses.  Then COVID happened.


COVID:

It was during 2020 that the change in my husband occurred.  He lost his job and started getting anxious for the first time in his life.  As a family we were in good shape but he individually was not doing well.  He was putting on a brave face for the kids but behind the scenes he was a mess.  He threw himself into house work, yard work, and video games to keep himself busy.  I don’t know what the breaking point was but in January 2021 something changed.  He started going to weekly therapy sessions for his anxiety.  On January 1st he started doing yoga every single day (and still does.)  We bought a Peloton and he took to it like a fish in water.  He stuck with it until he built up enough muscle and now does 200+ miles a month every month.  He started doing their workout classes and talked to a nutritionist.  The pounds melted off him.  He started applying to jobs he previously thought he was too dumb or inexperienced or uneducated for and got one.  It was amazing to watch and I felt so lucky to support his growth during this time while I plugged away in the corporate world.


The Problem:

It all came to head a few months ago.  I got laid off from the company I had worked so hard for.   The company I lost so much time with my kids for.  I had worked up to the director level and it was just gone in a flash.  After we got the kids down we had a good long talk and at the end of it he told me to not stress about finding anything, we don’t need me to work anyway.  He was right.  He makes a ludicrously large amount of money compared to what he used to, more than most doctors (since people will ask he used to be a machinist but after a lucky break followed by a promotion and then another promotion he essentially helps run one of the plants for a defense contractor).  Then the dominoes of realizations started to fall for me in the coming weeks; he makes more than enough to support us, I make nothing; he is an amazing father where as I was a career first mother (that was all for nothing) and don’t have the same relationship with our children as he does; he doesn’t just have abs but also that incredible V thing next to his abs while I have a gut and flabby arms.

The other day when I struck up a conversation at school pickup the other mom said, “o you’re the one with the hot husband, sooooooo how DID you lock him down?”  The subtext here could not be more obvious and this is not the first time something like this has happened.  I see how the other Moms look at him.  Sexually I can’t keep up with him.  He has always had a high libido while I am on the lower side.  The man is a stallion in bed and I get winded so easily compared to him.

Thank god he is a human golden retriever, oblivious to any flirting that I’m sure is happening when I’m not around.  I think the only reason he hasn’t left me yet is he’d rather be building a magic deck or playing helldivers 2 than go through the trouble of hiding an affair.  It feels like it is only a matter of time before he realizes he is out of my league now and replaces me with someone who can keep up physically, monetarily, and mentally.  We generally communicate great and he has reassured me time after time after time that he only has eyes for me.  He insists the only reason he got where he is is because of the support I gave him, how I kept the finances going for so long so he could improve himself.  He says the sex is so amazing he can’t imagine having it with anyone else.  He says there is no winners and losers in a couple and if one wins we both win.  He freely gives me access to his phone to try and cull my fears.  I feel like I struck nerd gold and my insecurity is keeping me from enjoying what should be a great life.  So how can I possibly feel secure and enjoy a marriage where I am the loser that other moms can’t figure out how I got the perfect man?

TL;DR: Was in a great relationship on mostly equal terms, then after a self improvement journey my husband became the perfect man that could easily leave me if he wanted to and I can’t feel secure or happy knowing that.

I was taken aback by this but I thought he was joking because I had told him I could charge him $30 (as a joke) for saying that this female friend of his is prettier than me (for the second time this year). Honestly I meant it as a joke at first but the more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I became. The more uncomfortable I became, the more I actually looked back at the things he did/said that I brushed off. One thing in particular that stood out was when forgot my birthday which was in May. In his defense, it was his brother's and close friend's birthday on the same day, and he was at both celebrations (True. I know them, but we are not close). I also joked about charging him $30 for that too, but the whole ""putting aside money thing"" came up when I joked about charging him for the pretty comment he made. He's not budging and I can't tell if it's a joke or not.

My wife and I have been together 6 years and married 2. We have always wanted kids but wanted to wait ans not rush at the start of our marriage. The pregnancy came as a surprise but a very welcomed and happy one. 

Everything went smoothly throughout the pregnancy. There were nevernany signs of issues. We decorated the nursery together and put up the furniture. We were so excited to meet our baby and be parents. She carried to term and the day of the birth again things were ok. She gave birth and we didn't hear any crying. We were so confused and you can see it in the doctors' eyes that they were very concerned. I can't begin to explain the heartbreak when we were told that our little girl didn't make it. We were able to hold her and she was so beautiful. 

A funeral home has a free funeral service for little angels so we buried ours just the two of us.I have never seen a casket so small. I have been trying to be strong for my wife. I only cry when she's not around so when she needs me I'm there. It's been hard to stay strong when she's crying in my arms. Seeing her like this adds to the pain.

Last night I couldn't hold it in and started bawling with her. She didn't like that at all. She started saying that I was trying to make it about me. How I should be the man and support her. She also said that I don't have the right to be so upset because I wasn't the one carrying her and giving birth. She went to bed and left me there.

I know she has it worse than me because she carried our angel and have birth to her. I just didn't expect her to react that way. But I lost my daughter too. I wanted to be a father, I didn't get to change her diaper for the first time and spend my first sleepless night with her crying. I lost her too. 

I know that my wife is hurting which is why she's reacting that way. How do I support her better but also let her know how I feel in a way that doesn't seem like I'm taking away from her?"
hlp01i,My (24M) wife (26F) keeps threatening to divorce me if I do not re-enlist into the Army.,5942,0.98,1115,2020-07-05 21:33:11,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlp01i/my_24m_wife_26f_keeps_threatening_to_divorce_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hlp01i/my_24m_wife_26f_keeps_threatening_to_divorce_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I joined the Army about 5 years ago. After basic training, AIT, and a half a year in a unit I started to hate it. I’ve felt out of place, unfree, held back, purposeless, and depressed. I’m pretty good at my job, but I’ve rarely ever had the pleasure of making any good friendships with my fellow soldiers. I feel like most of what I’ve done in the Army has in some way been a waste of time. I’ve met some cool people and done a few cool things but none of those pros can make up for the cons. I’m sick of it. 

I am not shy about complaining about this to my wife. I’ve told her multiple times how much I hate the Army, and how much I want to get out. I’ve told her my plan, probably not the best, which is to go to school full time and work as much as possible. I have been honest with her about my income shrinking once I get out. I think that between the two of us (she’s college educated and makes more than me) we can make it work. 

Today while we were driving to a hike she brought up wanting to buy an SUV before I PCS (move to a different duty station). I told her that we could not afford it. She immediately got angry and made the correct assumption that I think that because I do not want to re-enlist. I was honest and told her that I don’t want to, that the Army makes me miserable, and that I would do whatever it took to take care of us once I got out. She made goods points about health insurance, our house payments, car payments, our pets, and eventually having a kid. She thinks that I will not do enough to take care of our family. I tried to counter that I would make it work (while putting the kid off) even if our finances were tight. Eventually things got out of hand, we both called each other selfish, and we went home. 

After I got out of the car she got back in and left. She texted me that she’s looking for apartments, that she’s contacted a realtor to sell our house, and that she’s going to file for divorce. This isn’t the first time that she has done all of this, and usually I get her to come back when I cave and say I’ll reconsider. I don’t want to reconsider anymore. I feel like my mind is made up, but I love my wife and don’t want a divorce. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore."

I’m flying out to visit him for his birthday in a couple weeks.  But mostly, I’m flying out because I don’t think he’ll be around much longer.  I think this will be the last time I see my brother.  

I’m trying to figure out what my time with him should be like.  I know I need to have boundaries as to not be enabling, though I don’t think I would be.  I more or less just don’t know if I should be putting pressure on him to change or if I should just have it be a time where I’m present with him?  

I want to avoid causing him to feel more shame than he does.  I understand he probably feels very ostracised from family and all of life, really.  I’d like to show him compassion as much as possible, but I also want him to get better.  

I also just kinda feel like I’m waiting for him to die.  

I don’t know.  My thoughts are kinda scrambled and I’m not certain what I’m asking really.  I guess just general advice for the situation?  I just don’t know what this time is supposed to be like."

Hey guys, so it turns out I may have been overreacting a little bit.

I sat her down yesterday and started telling her how uncomfortable I felt because of what she said and explained to her that I was hurt because of what she said because she knows how competitive my brother and I can be. At that point if I'm being honest I was fully prepared to break up with her if she didn't get it, especially because almost all of the comments on the first post were saying that its a sign of disrespect.

But she said that she didn't realize how messed up the comment she made was until after it happened and she swears that she's never even thought about him that way and that she was just thinking of guys who had the body type she was talking about. She also said that there is no other guy she'd rather be with sexually or romantically.

She seemed really remorseful about the whole thing and even said that if I had said the same thing about one of her friends it would have killed her and she just kept apologizing, calling herself stupid and asking if I'm mad at her. So I told her to just forget about it and I know how she doesn't think before she speaks sometimes and I'm just glad to know that she didn't mean anything by it.

So everything worked out for the best and I've decided that I'm gonna try to be less insecure from now on and I'll also try to stop overreacting to stuff like that.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice (especially the top comment from the previous post, Thank you for the helpful advice)

EDIT: So I read some of the comments, and to all the people that think she's lying and that she's going to cheat on me eventually Let me tell you this, I know for a fact that she was telling the truth. I can tell whenever she's lying (we've known each other for a long time and she's not a very good liar) and I can safely say that she would never cheat on me, she's just not that kind of person. 

TLDR- She apologized about the whole thing and assured me she didn't mean my brother specifically and that she was just comparing body types, so I've decided to let it go and move on."

I hate assholes. They do nothing for me, i don’t want to look at them, touch them, have mine looked at/touched. I don’t like thinking they exist. Yeah, i know it’s weird; no, it really probably isn’t going to change. 
My other issue here is that I’m so proud of him for it. Like, he’s come so far with being comfortable with his sexual desires and i am overjoyed seeing him doing so well for himself, especially since we’re long distance. 
Occasionally I’ll send him nudes if I’m up in the middle of the night because he likes waking up to them, but my other problem is that now I wake up to pictures of him really hard with toys up his ass. 
I don’t want this. 
I never wanted this. 
Thinking about putting things in butts makes me want to vomit and i want nothing to do with it. But I’m also in the position of not wanting to tell him because i don’t want him to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Please help me. 

Edit: thank you so much for the feedback everyone, you honestly don’t know how much i appreciate it, and I’m happy i came here for advice. I’m gonna talk to him tomorrow and give an update when the time comes

Edit 2: I wasn’t expecting this to blow up, so thanks to everyone except a few of you. 

@ everyone giving the advice to tell him he’s gay(I’m bi and we’ve talked about it, he’s not)/discourage him from doing what sexually pleases him, fuck you guys. I’m talking to him today so I’ll update again in a few hours 

The BIG EDIT: I texted him this morning and we talked about it, and everything is O.K. I feel like some of you guys are looking for a really dramatic and satisfying wrap-up but it was kind of not that big of a deal to him. I did make him laugh though because he wasn’t expecting a conversation about his asshole first thing in the morning and he wants to see this post so apparently that’s happening too. Again, thank you for your help everyone besides the aforementioned people in my last edit. Perhaps in another life I’ll like assholes a little more. He might comment on this so if you scroll down you may or may not see some playful asshole banter between us below

He threw a hissy fit about it and said that it was ""basically cheating"" and guilted me into apologizing and promising not to do it again. The next time we went to use my vibrator (during sex as we basically always did)  it had stopped working (mysteriously in hindsight). I often used it in the shower I guess just because that's basically the only time I get to myself. I eventually just turned to using the shower head and one time he pounded on the door during to ask what I was doing. Again, I didn't really think much of it at the time. Tonight I was showering (and not doing anything else) and when I came out and he was being short and pissy with me. I asked if everything was okay and he says 'So how was your ""shower""?' I said fine? Confused... he goes on to say he knows what I was doing in there and I responded by asking what he was talking about, to which he replied that every time I shower he sits outside the bathroom door and listens to see if I'm masturbating. I was so shocked I didn't even know what to say. How can I tell him that this is a violation of my privacy and personal space without him feeling like I'm disrespecting him?

I don't know what the next steps are. 

I'm in my late 30s, he is in his early 40s. We have been married for almost 10 years. No kids. In the last year he came out as bisexual but not by choice. I caught him talking to men on grindr. He swore he never physically cheated and was just exploring fantasies he never had the chance to explore. We went through a significant rough patch but ultimately I decided to give him another chance.

Several months ago he asked if I would consider an ""open relationship"" to allow him to experiment with a man. I said that wasn't something I could ever be comfortable and if he needs to do this then the only option is to separate. I have tried to be patient and understanding. He said he didn't need it and I should forget he even asked.

Since the grindr incident I have no fully trusted him and i admit I looked at his phone without permission. He has been texting an 18 year old young man for well over a month. The messages are sexual and he (my husband) is very overtly asking for more. I don't know if anything has happened in person.

This is not a young man he met online, at work, at a bar. That would still be horrifying to me but at least slightly more acceptable. He is our close mutual friends' foster son who we have known for years. I was aware he was gay but I never would have dreamed this would happen. He is a child to me.

I admit that at first I was angry with the young man but I understand he is young and vulnerable and it is my husband who is in the wrong. From the messages I saw, he was not encouraging this and some of his responses to my husband seemed uncomfortable. I can't blame him.

I have not yet spoken to my husband. I don't know what to say. He knows something is up because he is being overly considerate and attentive. I know I need to leave, I couldn't ever feel the same about him after this. I don't know if I should say anything to the young man or his foster parents. 

To be very clear, this relationship is over but I need advice about how to approach it. 

SMALL UPDATE: I am currently staying with a friend while I figure out my next steps and I have been making a start getting legal and financial advice in place. I have not yet spoken to my husband. He seems to have realised something is up because he is being much ""nicer"" and trying to engage much more than usual, but staying with a friend for a few days is not terribly unusual for me in itself. I have not yet spoken to 18m and/or his foster parents, I am still trying to figure out the best approach but I have received some helpful advice from this post which I will keep in mind. I don't imagine any of this will be resolved any time soon but I expect the coming weeks to be extremely difficult. 

FURTHER UPDATE: I have spoken to the young man's foster parents and briefly to him. Some information came to light that stressed the urgency and led me to believe it would be safer and more helpful to speak to them first, despite him being over 18. I don't have the time or energy to explain exactly what happened and of course it wouldn't be appropriate to share a lot of detail. The situation is even more complicated and upsetting than I realised and my husband is entirely at fault. The young man is safe, more or less, and my husband's behaviour is no longer hidden from his carers. I am in the early stages of determining my next steps regarding separating from my husband and I am receiving specialist advice about this."

I had made the other account specifically to talk about  stuff related to my work but never actually posted with it. I made this one to comply with the sub's rules which I previously did not know about.

I will comment go out with the original to verify but I just wanted to give an update and thank everyone who chimed in from the bottom of my heart.  You guys literally have kept me sane and show me that I wasn't crazy. I sincerely thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

Original post:

> This is a sensitive topic and I'm not going to go into detail for obvious reasons. I am actively being kept in the dark by her family and honestly these days have blended together.



>  We have been together for almost 3 years off and on. This is by far my longest relationship. We've had a lot of Trials and most of it pertains to our mental struggles. Sometimes it was her, sometimes it was me but we made it work. I know this is going to sound cheesy but I really feel like she is my soulmate.



> There has been an ongoing issue with her lashing out and me enduring it. Twice, I canceled gigs for my job so I could stay up late at night to talk her out of hurting herself. That has been a constant clash between us. She feels I think she's ugly because of scars on her wrists and legs and thinks it is not my place to try to get her help.



> The past year has been rough on both of us and I've not been able to be there mentally for her as much as I was in the past. I am in a place in my career where I have been busy for the first time in my life and I'm fortunate enough to have a full-time job during these times. 



> The thing is we haven't really been fighting leading up to this. The last time I saw her was peaceful and I honestly thought we were better than we ever had been. We had just talked about finally getting to go see the ocean once everything had settled down. 

> She just asked if I could call off tomorrow to spend the day with her so we could smoke and hang out. I just said I was busy and she took it okay if I thought. Nothing changed. And I left after an hour or so because I really needed to get some sleep. 

> I got a call at about 6 the next morning, she'd shot herself with her friend's gun. Her mom told me she would rather not see me there. I didn't go to work so I just sat at my home in shock. Nobody would tell me anything. It's really broken a lot of trust with a lot of people that I would call life long friends. I don't want to know every detail I just wanted to make sure she was okay. 

> A few days later, her dad called and said I could go visit her. He didn't say much, just that something else had happened too. She's had other medical problems. She was asleep when I saw her. They think she's going to recover pretty confidently. I was there 10 minutes before her dad ushered me out. I tried to talk to a doctor but he kept nudging me to leave.

> About three more days later, her sister called me and said that she may be coming home soon. And that's when she told me I would have a chance to make things right. I asked what she meant and apparently my girlfriend blamed me for everything. She sent a text accusing me of abandoning her and saying things I never would dream of saying. She also states that I had borrowed the gun for my friend and gave it to her. That doesn't make sense.

> She ended the call with ""once she comes home, you can focus on helping her and saving your relationship"". That was a week ago and I haven't heard anything since. Social media has been quiet, no calls or texts. The only people I've been around is when I'm at the bar and people are just as surprised as I am to learn that I don't know nothing. 

> It just doesn't add up to me. If they think I did these awful things,why would anyone want me back with her? Is she awake right now? I've searched a bit but I can't really find anything out. I have called my friend who owns the firearm multiple times and I am pretty close to just driving up to his house to figure out what is going on or at least get him to tell her family the truth.

> I sent her sister a text telling her the truth in every detail how about what happened when I was there. I even sent her screenshots of us wishing each other a good night and talking about how we could hang out that weekend when I'm off work.

> Anyhow, the main thing of this post as I need advice because I'm planning on breaking up with her at the moment. This was just too far for me and I can't handle it. I feel awful just typing this, I am bawling my eyes out right now but I can't help someone who doesn't want help and would say those things about me.

> I am being treated so horribly for something I didn't do and I need peace. I really love her and I would honestly be in that hospital bed instead of her if I could. But this has crossed a line. Normally we would fight and one of us would cave. I would be mad and within a day be wanting to talk to her again.

> I don't. I don't think I could ever look someone in the eyes after they've done something like that to me. I feel like a piece of shit. Have they even deleted every picture of us off my phone and if it wouldn't stir anything up, I would remove everything related to her from social media.

> I know this is out of everyone's pay grade. I just need to know him wrong thinking this way?Is there something I'm missing?I am just dumbfounded and I don't tell who what is real anymore.

Update:


A couple days after the post, I met with the mother in person.  I asked her to meet with me through text. She has always loved me since I started dating her daughter years ago.  I can confidently say that they are not going to come after me legally or there is any malicious intent.  Unfortunately the person I loved did indeed say awful things about me and lie. She will recover from the shooting.

I showed her the messages,  I showed her a text where my girlfriend was joking about wanting to keep the pistol grips clarifying  it was my friend's gun.  I also showed her texts  during some of the rougher times,  me staying up all night to talk her out of self-harm, etc. She also agreed to me recording us talking with my phone. This time has gotten everyone paranoid and I needed to know that there was no twist or ambush coming.

 We both cried a few times talking.  I also dropped the bomb that I would be leaving her daughter.  She is officially my ex and I feel torn about that but I have to get away.  Her mom agrees that it was unfair and horrible for her to lie about me.  And that feels so validating and painful,  hearing it out loud that her daughter lied. She promised to get her help and apologized to me.She even said that she would still consider me a son.

I have no ill-will towards her family and I hope they have none for me. I understand they were just trying to protect their daughter and based on her story, I was this manipulative monster who tried rob them of her. I also want to clarify that I was unofficially barred from seeing her at the hospital. I could have gone but I didn't want to make a grieving families time harder and I am thankful for the time they did let me see her.

Her sister texted me and apologized as well.  A day later,  yesterday,  I met with my friend who owned the gun.  I showed up at his house after he continuously ignored me.  It was basically a huge misunderstanding.  He was afraid that I was angry at him for letting her borrow the gun and I took his silence on the issue as validating her lie. We're good. I have a friend now. 

I have also signed up for counseling and will be going to my first online appointment  Saturday.  As for my job, I am taking a week leave  using my vacation days,  the time I was going to use to go to the beach with her,  because while I did continue to work throughout all this.  I need a break. 

As for my ex, I believe she's home. I have blocked her on everything and I have no intention of talking to her again. Some of her eyes were very personal and there is no other way to take what she said. It fucking hurts. I have loved this person more than I have loved anyone in this world. 

But this is something I have to do completely or not at all.I have texted our mutual friends, my entire friend group, stating that I would gladly talk to any of them and set the record straight and I've even received a couple replies showing support for me. Which kinda seems hollow honestly.

At the end of the day, I think I will be okay now. I do love my ex, her family has always treated me right and accepted me in when mine would not. I will always be thankful for them. I'm pretty sure my friend group will continue on without me or her though I may end up breaking down sooner or later because of it. 

 I feel like I've lost out on a chapter of my life. Years wasted.I feel irrationally angry sometimes. I know we didn't have the best relationship but I didn't deserve that. It helps me to keep repeating that to myself. In some ways I might have saved her life. I did make a point to mention to both the mother and sister that I could have posted every bit of our dirty laundry on Facebook, but I'm not going to do that unless provoked. 

That is not a threat.  They both understood that I mean that in case my ex tries to come after me in anyway.  It still hurts like right now typing this.  But I hope it will with time."

I had posted about getting a new engagement ring for my fiancée after a bad fight. 


It’s been a long time (we’re married now) and it occurred to me to update bc the story is funny and I want people to know that really hard  moments can happen and a solid relationship can still weather them. 


I went ahead and got a totally gorgeous new ring made. I waited until we went on a trip to the city where she lived when we met. I got the keys to her old building from a former roommate, and planned to take her up to the roof of her old building with a bottle of champagne. I felt as nervous as the first time!


Day comes and I’m anxious to head toward her old hood and suprise her with the key then propose.  Suddenly, she wanted to take me to some random parkette near where we were staying. I was frustrated! As we sat on this random bench she starts telling me how this is where she was sitting the first time we talked romantically on the phone... and she pulled out a ring and proposed to ME lol (we’re both women fyi) 


Kinda stole my thunder! Couple hours later, I finally got to re-propose and we laughed and laughed. Triple engaged. [[see rings here!]](https://imgur.com/gallery/6k3htH1) 


Right after our wedding her engagement ring broke, was repaired, broke again so she was wearing the original (v modest) ring again until we got around to a repair. I took the upgrade to a jeweler and had it reset more securely, and on our 6 mo anniversary I arranged a fancy restaurant setting with a specific meal and cocktail menu named after inside jokes etc... and proposed with the repaired ring all over again. People LOVE congratulating a proposal/engagement. It’s this burst of positive energy for everyone involved. 


I am glad we didn’t flinch after that bad fight. I think I might just keep proposing until we die. 


TL;DR
I asked for advice about re-proposing after a bad (but not ugly) fight. She had the same thought. We’re married now, and I intend to keep proposing every so often."

I moved there with my family when I was very young as my mother is Swedish, however he only moved here about seven years ago. We were together for almost six years, and we married each other about six months ago. I found out I was pregnant about two months ago. I’m about thirteen weeks pregnant now, and everything seems to be going well. All our tests have been clear so far and I am healthy. My husband and I are both very happy, and I'm quite excited to be having a baby, although nervous. I was very nervous about pregnancy, hence why it was an accidental pregnancy, but so far it’s been alright, other than the nausea. This was until my husband told me he wanted to move countries. 

I am still a dual citizen of both Sweden and Belarus. My husband also is. However, I feel no need to go back there, the last time I did was when I was thirteen. I've lost most of my Russian, and I don't like the situation over there. Most of my family is here, and I've always felt more at home here than I ever have there. My husband explained he had applied for a job there, and he thinks we would have a better life there, and so would our child. I got really upset, I told him that he can't just make this decision for the both of us, and that I don't want to go back there. It scares me, I don't want my child in that environment, and I like the Swedish schools and way of life more. I knew my husband missed Belarus but I never thought he wanted to go back. 

He got annoyed at me, and said I wasn't thinking in the best interest of our child. I was honest, and said that if he made me go back there, that I would divorce him and do everything I can to go back home. And that he can't make me, and that I'm not going and I won't go. He yelled at me and said that he was my husband, and that it's not up to me to decide how our life will be. I told him that he never said that was how he saw marriage, and he was being archaic. He seemed to calm down, but later when we were sleeping together, he got far too aggressive and his hands ended up on my throat. I managed to push him away, he didn't hurt me but I was worried about the baby, but he then started for some reason complaining about how dramatic I was being about this whole pregnancy and I seem to think it makes me entitled to decide everything, and he wasn't even being that rough. 

He's never acted like this before. It's like he thinks he can control my life, and our future child's life. We're supposed to make decisions together, not just one of us. I'm starting to think I can't stay him. It's not just about moving countries, it's the way he seems to think he's entitled to decide my whole life just because he's my husband. I've always thought that men have no more rights to make decisions than women in a marriage, as that's the point of a marriage. We're together. My brain is a mess right now. I'd always thought I loved him but now I look at him and I realise that I just can't do this if he carries on like this and I feel so stupid for not seeing it before. I don't know if it's the hormones, or my own emotions becoming too involved, but I'm really doubting this right now.  "

I apologize as this is going to be a long one. Obligatory apology for formatting as I’m on mobile. 

Last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar I was at with my friends. He was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. The first thing he said to me was “let me know if anyone here touches you, I’m in a fighting mood.” ?! What. I’m just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

A couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. Stupid, I know. We ended up staying all night, I stayed over because I left my house keys in our DDs car and my friend, I’ll call her Emilia, left late in the morning. 

In that time, him and Emilia had had “life chats” and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. At one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days’ makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn’t even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. I have struggled with acne for almost ten years. I’m twenty now. He knows I’m insecure about my skin. 

Anyways. After everyone else had gone home, I was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until I finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. I was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, I asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. He hung up and yelled at me saying I was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

I got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. This time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. “Look at me, *look* at me!” Then he tells me that he has a crush on Emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who’s ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

I can’t stress enough how much I have done for this dude. We have been on and off for **THREE** years. I have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn’t have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn’t have a running vehicle, used my CAA when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. But I apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like Emilia has. 

Earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn’t even opened his [message](https://imgur.com/a/zKlRFTU), I didn’t even know he had messaged her. I honestly don’t even know what to say about it, I’m kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time I’ve spent taking care of him has been all for not. That he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

Here is the part where I ask you, dear redditors, for advice. What do I do? I’ve already broken up with him, blocked him on everything (then unblocked to tell him to get off my netflix), me and Emilia will remain friends of course but, how do I cope with the fact that the person I thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? How do I keep myself from resenting her for it? She is one of my favourite people in this world, I know that this is 100% not her fault, I just don’t want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. Lastly, what is the best way to move on? Please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

If you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.

Edit: He was not an addict when we started dating, the coke habit he picked up afterwards. I just didn’t want to see him choose that path for himself and thought that I could help him, which I know now is beyond me.

Edit 2: Holy smokes. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts. I’m so sorry I can’t reply to you all but I promise I am listening and share many of your opinions. I appreciate everything you have to say whether it is tough-love or no-love. 

To clarify some things: I dumped him! I am NOT mad at Emilia, was just looking for advice so that I don’t shift blame. We WERE dating when this happened and that is why I went to his house, when we were off we were VLC. Emilia and I became friends last year through work and have lived in different cities the entirety of our friendship which is why they’d never hung out.

Edit 3: Here is my chance to PROFIT. Please send me your pet pictures!!! I need as many smiles as I can get and your sweet fluffy babies will bring me almost as much joy as they do you💗

Edit 4: Okay I promise I’m done editing after this but HOLY. SMOKES. Gilded?! My reddit award cherry has been popped! This is nuts. I never expected this many people to read it, let alone respond or GILD me. Just a final thank you to everyone who’s reached out and offered support. You are all beautiful people and have really helped me see the light in this situation."
cj97v6,Am I [F22] wrong for leaving my family dinner after my brothers fiancé [F24] decided to publicly “joke” about my relationship issues in front of everyone?,5898,0.97,452,2019-07-29 15:34:56,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj97v6/am_i_f22_wrong_for_leaving_my_family_dinner_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cj97v6/am_i_f22_wrong_for_leaving_my_family_dinner_after/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"A bit of background: Me and boyfriend (recently ex boyfriend) definitely had our fair share of issues. He really struggled with insecurities and jealousy issues. The idea of me going to the gym alone was one he struggled with. Additionally certain articles of clothing I wore were also an issue for him (he would get extremely upset seeing other men “check me out”). He ultimately decided to seek therapy for these issues determined to fix them. After long discussion we decided it would be best for both of us to part ways as he tries to work through his own issues. This break up occurred not even 2 weeks ago, and of course still feels very raw to me. 

I regularly confided in my older brother about these issues throughout my relationship (we are very close). It has been apparent he has discussed some of these issues with his finance. I wasn’t upset, I understood it was his finance after all. I felt comfortable that these discussions were between the three of us. 

However this was not the case tonight. Everyone came to our house this evening for a BBQ. This included my parents, all my siblings, and friends of my brother and I. I walked in the door in full gym attire as I had just came from the gym. My brother finances looks at me and loudly announces “WOW you really are single now! Look at you actually being allowed to  go to the gym again! *insert annoying laugh here*”. The room instantly got silent, everyone looked to me with uncomfortable expressions looking for my reaction. I was so shocked it took me a second to process what she just said in front of everyone. My dad quickly realizing how uncomfortable I was, changed the subject and everyone began talking again. 

I was hurt by this so called “joke” but for the sake of the night I decided to let it go thinking that would be the end of it. NOPE. Not even thirty minutes later, everyone is gathered around the table getting food buffet style. She looks at my outfit and announces “Oooh you wore leggings to the gym? Must be nice to finally be able to wear leggings again without (ex’s name) telling you what you can and can’t wear” again followed by her fake laughter. I instantly felt my blood boil (from anger and sheer embarrassment). I politely corrected her saying I was always allowed to wear what I like, despite his feelings of insecurities. 

NO ONE in my family knew these details about our relationship. I had no intention of ever telling them. This was extremely personal to me. I excused myself to the restroom and quickly grabbed my car keys and slid out the backdoor. As soon as I started driving, I started bawling my eyes out. I know this may seem dramatic to some, but I was really effected by this. I was so shocked and angry by how another adult could ever think this type of behavior was ok. I received several texts asking where I was, and saying how I made a “scene” by leaving the dinner. I only responded to my parents letting them know I needed a bit of space. I also feel extremely hurt for my ex, as some of his friends were in attendance at this dinner. She has no right to publicly air my ex’s very personal issues to his friends or to my family. Am I wrong for abruptly leaving the family dinner and creating an apparent “scene”?

Hi everyone, sorry for the late update, life gets in the way and been really busy. Anyway, I thought I'd make this update for those who were curious about how it all went.

The meeting actually went really well!

So after a couple reschedules, we drove to hospital to see Ken and his mom earlier this week. We arrived quite early in the morning (around 8 am). His mom stays with him overnight most days, so it was good timing for her to ""hand over"" Ken to us while she goes back and rest. A redditor suggested an idea that we brought in a care package for her and we did, it's just a box filled with a couple pairs of warm socks, mosturizer, books, and toiletries. She burst into tears when receiving those. It was such a great idea.

Anyway, so firstly we came in together (my wife and myself) and we did a small catch up. It was a slow process since Ken couldn't really speak too long in one go (if I make sense), so it had to be broken up in sections. I asked him if he would like some time alone with Susan and he said yes, so I left both of them alone and went out for a walk/do a bit of remote work on my laptop. I just told her to text me if she needs anything.

So I left Susan and Ken for about a couple hours before Susan texted me that I can come back up. Anyway, during this time basically Susan asked ""what happened?"" to Ken. Why did he move interstate so soon, and was there another motive behind it. Well the story goes as follows:

* Ken was working a low paying job at the time and was feeling like he's never going to get any career progression
* Susan and myself knew Ken has always been creative-minded (he got a diploma in film and everything), but what we didn't know is that behind everyone's back, during that time, he was searching for career opportunities in film/animation industry.
* He put in a job application for fun, and a few months later, got offered a position as an intern animator (something along those lines according to Susan)
* He was stoked, but he didn't expect that he would actually get the job. Therefore, he actually never planned anything in advance.
* The job required him to move interstate ASAP, and Ken felt pressured to say yes, since he's applied to other similar jobs in the past but got rejected (hence why it took him by surprise and he didn't do any planning - it's the ""well I won't get it anyway so why I should make arrangements"" mentality, according to Susan)
* So he asked Susan to move with him, but left out the job details since as an intern, he will get paid even less than what he's earning, with a lot of voluntary work. He was scared that Susan will not approve of the lower wage, so he left out the details and just asked her to move out with him.
* He admitted it was stupid, and apologized for being immature about it.
* After the breakup, and after working a few months as an intern, he said that working in that industry is not like what he thought it would be. There were a lot of ""crunch"" time, to the point where him and the other interns were spending most of their time in the office, even sleeping while waiting for the program/code/animation to finish compiling (I'm not tech savvy, but I figured animations take a long time to set up).
* He then got into alcohol, since everyone in the office also drinks. This then turned to severe drinking to cope with stress. This then turned to smoking and drugs.
* Anyway, he stuck it out and became a ""technical lead"", but he said he had 0 social life or support apart from a couple colleagues, and that he's burning himself out everyday. The ""support"" he got was basically a small group that goes out on social drinks only. That's why he kept going back into alcohol and drugs etc. He's been in and out of hospital with alcohol poisoning and actually never sought help. He said he might also be depressed but he's earning enough just to pay rent (with all his alcohol expenses etc...) so he didn't seek any help.
* He also did a lot other bad decisions that are popcorn-worthy but way too long to include here. Things that got him arrested, fired from his job (so he had to find another), etc etc
* When asked about the park situation, he said there was no malice intended, it was only because he was ""sick of being in hospital all the time with no window of opportunity to go outside"".

And... that's it, really. His substance abuse got him to where he is now. I managed to catch up with him and reminisce about the good old days when we were still hanging out together (told him it's hard to see anyone these days due to COVID). He said that a few of his old friends from school have visited him, and he was so happy that they still care. He told me that he tried reaching out to his former girlfriend as well to apologize, but only Susan turned up (he has had other relationships since breaking up with her). He said he's sad about it, but he would like to tie up loose ends while he still has the time.

In terms of his prognosis, I asked, and he said he doesn't know, though there are plans for him to continue end of life care at home (and he would prefer it that way).

When we left Ken,  I asked Susan what she thought of everything and she told me that she felt a lot better now that she's gone and seen him. She then told me all of the story above during the ride back home. Plenty of time she was cursing and saying ""man I can't believe he did that, what a dumb person"". So for those of you who were worried that she might go back to Ken, sorry to burst your bubble, I don't think it's happening.

I asked her how she's feeling again the next day and she's pretty much forgotten about it, and just hoped that his mom can cope with the stress since she's a nice person. She does look a lot less ""guilty"" though, so I'm glad we did went. We haven't really touched on this topic again for days now, since we've been focusing more on work and our upcoming road trip.

Thanks for all the redditors who chimed in and helped, from both prespective.

In these uncertain times, we should still try to be kind to others. And if there's any takeaway from this, is to seek help if you need it. Obviously Ken was in a bad spot, but spurred by bad influences. If you know a friend of yours who are spiralling out of control, or starting to get into destructive habits, reach out. Who knows, you might save a life."

And I couldn’t control her, I could either be angry or be okay with it so I decided to just act chill and be okay with it. She said it was only girls and they were going to Miami for innocent fun. Drinking and dancing and no guys allowed. I believed her but I am needy and I love her so every morning while she was gone, we would FaceTime for a bit, just say good morning and stuff. I would miss her. 

She was out having fun but she’d still FaceTime me every morning and I loved that. I looked forward to seeing her. I FaceTimed her this morning and she kept declining it and I texted her asking her what she was doing that for. She said she just didn’t wanna talk because she looked ugly and I was very confused since I don’t care about that. So I kept calling and she finally picked up and she was with one of her girl friends eating breakfast in bed with some random Italian looking guy. She tried to purposely hide him from the camera but I’m not dumb. I asked her who that was and she immediately was like “listen nothing happened, I didn’t do anything, so don’t yell at me. We met him last night at the club, he’s nice and let us spend the night and he slept on his couch, nothing happened so don’t worry.” I was pissed off because she was implying that I’d be overreacting if I got mad that she was in bed with another guy but I continued with our morning talk. She’s still on her trip and I don’t know what to think. Does it seem like she was lying"
em08o5,I (41M) am struggling with new fatherhood and my wife's (40F) cancer diagnosis,5855,0.97,315,2020-01-09 04:10:38,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/em08o5/i_41m_am_struggling_with_new_fatherhood_and_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/em08o5/i_41m_am_struggling_with_new_fatherhood_and_my/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Fuck, so where do I start? I guess by justifying my throwaway: I don't post personal shit on my regular Reddit account. 

A year and a half ago I married the woman of my dreams. I met her almost 15 years ago and life just didn't line up for us until then. In early July we found out we were pregnant with our first child after 8 months of trying, a baby boy. Life seemed so perfect and I was on cloud nine with everything. 

Right before Christmas, my wife went into preterm labour and we found out then that she has advanced ovarian cancer. The doctors all said that we were lucky because it's particularly aggressive and if she wasn't pregnant it would have been disastrous. 

On Christmas Eve she was induced and we welcomed our baby son at 33 weeks. He's doing great in the NICU luckily. But two days later she had her cancer surgery and scans. They had to take her whole uterus and ovaries plus big tumors from her stomach and one kidney and they found cancer cells in her lungs. She's going to go through chemotherapy soon, 6 months. 

The doctor's prognosis wasn't very positive. Her survival rate is around 10% and that's only if the chemo works. Because it's so aggressive they're afraid it won't. 

I'm struggling pretty hard at being a husband and dad right now. I love her so fucking much but all I want to do is run away. I can't handle seeing her so sick and I know it's only going to get worse. I can't handle knowing that she might die. I can't handle seeing my son in the NICU even though he's doing really good. 

I can feel myself checking out because it's all too much and I know I need to be there for them but I don't know how and I don't know how to tell her because I know it's not her fault. I feel like I'm failing and I don't know what to do so I'm turning here. How do you support the people who need you when all you want to do is run? How do I be a good husband and dad when I feel like I'm not equipped for any of this? I see these super supportive husbands on oncology and dad's in the NICU and I feel like shit that I'm internally screaming and feeling so hopeless and they've got it all together, you know? My wife and baby boy deserve the best and I don't know how to give it to them. Help?"
16krqne,How to avoid telling my (25f) best friend (25f) that her fiancé just died?,5841,0.97,357,2023-09-17 10:17:55,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16krqne/how_to_avoid_telling_my_25f_best_friend_25f_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16krqne/how_to_avoid_telling_my_25f_best_friend_25f_that/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Last weekend, my best friend and her fiancé were in a severe car accident. Unfortunately, her fiancé passed and she suffered severe life threatening injuries. 

She has just come out of her coma and doesn’t know why she’s in the hospital. She keeps asking about her fiancé and where he is. Her medical team and family have refrained from telling her because her vitals are currently unstable, and a spike in BP could onset another stroke. 

I’m visiting her at the hospital tomorrow. How do I handle the questions about her fiancé without responding in a way that will make her mad at me later on. I don’t think she’d ever get over it if I lied to her about this, even if for her health. To clarify, I have *no* plan of disrespecting her family and medical team’s wishes. I just want to strike a balance of evading without sparking more concern. 

***Edit 1***: just a gentle reminder that I’m grieving a really difficult situation. Comments that I’m a bad friend or that this post is fake (even though I realize we’re on the internet) are a bit hurtful atm. Please see my comments/replies for further clarification on how this is very much our tough reality ❤️

***Edit 2***: thank you to everyone for your thoughtful and sincere advice. After much thinking, I’ve decided to stay home—she’s verbally communicating now (woohoo!!) but isn’t necessarily feeling up to visitors. Plus, this gives me time to speak with a professional. That said, ***I still would very much appreciate input people may have for supporting her in her grieving process once she knows!!*** If anyone has any recommendations or experiences with grief groups or other resources, I very much welcome that input. Everyone’s kind words and support has selfishly helped me process this even a bit more. I’m very grateful for you all."

We were friends and I bought her when I was 19 because her father wanted to accept an offer by another dude she hated. We were able to work and study at university thanks to the facade marriage and always intended to leave the cult after we had stable jobs which we have now. We live together ever since our marriage but we have different rooms, split the bills and can date who we want of course.

A couple of months ago we went to our hometown for a few days to see our familes and she kissed me a lot (we were both single) which we never did but it would have been weird if I refused too many kisses when we had to act married. After that we went to the airb&b room for the night, and we got a bit drunk and she kept making sexual jokes and we ended up having sex. We didn't even talk about it and kept acting married for the rest of the time there and then dropped it when we came back home, it was reakly weird. Then I had a girl flirt eith me like 1 month later to a mutual friend's graduation party, and she interrupted and said to a friend of her "", I want to introduce you my husband...

Also she's been very moody when I told her I was talking with a girl, and she invited her brother home exactly the day I was supposed to go on the first date. So I had to rescheduled another day and she told me those day she wanted us to go for her aunt's birthday, we never went to her birthday before. 
Also she looks happier since when the girl said she doesn't want to date me anymores and is trying to get physical contact eay more often like hugs or tickling me. Two days ago we were out to buy stuff forvthe house and it felt like we were an actual couple, and I can tell she felt it too and there was this weird tension. Then yesterday she was messing with my hairs and I really wanted to kiss her and can't stop thinking about it since then.

I've been talking about divorce for a while but she's making excuses and saying we'll talk sbout it kater and we never do. I'm really confused about all of this, I've never been so attracted to someone before and she's a great person. We always had a great chemistry as friends and housemates. There were also moments in the past I thought about he this way but never this intensely. I'm becoming really really attracted by her.

I always imposed myself not to do anything about it because it would be like abusing my position of power, as I literally bought her and was still paying back the loan. But then again now we're independent now and we split everything, is it ok if I wanted to date her? What should I do? If I do date her should we still get a divorce first? Or just date and see what happens? Wouldn't it be weird to start dating eith someone who is technically my wife? I'm think I'm going crazy and I need to take a decision soon, I very much doubt I will be able to not kiss her if she messes with my hairs again like that"

Short history, my wife is 10 years younger than me. I met her in Cambodia and we got married. We have a couple of gorgeous kids and have lived in the UK for more than 3 years. Having children has definitely put a strain on us, we were happy and care free prior to that and the last couple of years have been tough. She has settled here but does feel isolated sometimes and has admitted taking it out on me. She has hit me a few times and when angry says very, very hurtful things that aren't true to try and break me. She then apologises after the storm has calmed.

Anyway, it's mother's day weekend and we were watching a funny film and sharing a glass of Prosecco. Things going well. We get to the end of the film (which had a sexual theme to it) and asked me to explain in detail about my sexual history before her. Please note - previous sexual partners in Cambodia is considered wrong and you should be pure for your husband/wife. I had explained this to her in Cambodia before we got married as I knew she was upset that I had slept with other people before her. But it was only 2, which in western society isn't really a massive number, and they were both long-term girlfriends. I said I didn't want to talk about it again because it would make everyone unhappy - I didn't want to think about it or talk about it as I was a very long time ago, I was with her now and have a brilliant family, and she wouldn't want to hear it anyway as she'd get upset. But she persisted and accused me of hiding information from her again and again until I just said ""Ok, ask me. Whatever you want. Up to you.""

So I told her again that I had had 2 girlfriends before her, she asked me how was it, where did we have sex, how many times etc. I explained honestly - my first time was terrible, between the 2 girlfriends we probably had sex  over a hundred times in the course of a couple of years. Tears filled her eyes and she turned to me and said ""You are fucking dirty and disgusting. If I find out that you old girlfriends have a baby from you then I would fucking <inappropriate and serious threat>. You took my pure body and made it disgusting and I am now dirty inside. You told me before but my English wasn't good. If I knew this before we got married I would have said no. NO. You're fucking dirty.""

I left the room angry and confused and went to sleep on the sofa. I turned on my phone this morning and she'd sent a message saying ""You destroyed my pure body"". I am so confused. We DID talk about this extensively before we got married as it was a dealbreaker and she was unhappy I wasn't a virgin but accepted it. We then went on to have a family, start a new life etc. We love each other and why this has turned into such a serious problem tonight is confusing and hurtful. Any help appreciated, my mind is spinning."

Then it escalated and I found my car tires had been slashed, the back window to my house smashed and - presumably - this person had gained access to my house. But I couldn't find anything missing/moved so I don't know if he actually entered my house.

At this point I told my girlfriend that we had to get the police involved, but she absolutely REFUSED and said she would not forgive me if I went against her wishes on this. Then I asked her to meet me half way and tell me who this mysterious ex-BF is, but she again refused because she thought I would tell the police about him.

Now I am wondering whether this person actually exists. I can't comprehend why my GF would be opposed to me going to the cops about a potentially dangerous stalker. I have no evidence this is a real person, only my GF's word. On the other hand, WHY? why would she fake this? Our relationship has never been perfect, but we also aren't abusive or dysfunctional

Requesting advice from you lot on how to confront my GF on this. I don't want to give her an opportunity to spin an elaborate set of lies if this is indeed a fiction. Anyone got advice?

tl;dr: gf has a stalker,  I'm beginning to doubt stalker exists"

g6duct,"UPDATE My wife ""baby-trapped"" me",5804,0.96,1825,2020-04-23 07:02:49,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g6duct/update_my_wife_babytrapped_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g6duct/update_my_wife_babytrapped_me/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Hey guys. The other post got way more attention than I expected so I figured you guys probably deserve an update. The last post was  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/fpxm56/my\_wife\_babytrapped\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fpxm56/my_wife_babytrapped_me/) .

To start - yes, I get it, I know how it looks. There's a lot of comments calling bullshit, r/PinkpillFeminism called it MRA fiction, it's perfectly balanced and so on. Yeah, I know, my life feels like a joke right now. Honestly, there's little point in me trying to defend it because first of all, if you don't reply to comments saying it's wrong you're intentionally ignoring them because they're right and if you do you're trying way to hard to patch up the holes. It doesn't really matter what I say, you guys won't believe me. And at this point it doesn't even matter because I'm looking for advice, I don't care if you think it's true.

So, let's start from the beginning. Wife is still at home. I'm going out of my mind. Kids don't understand what's happening and keep on asking why I won't talk to Mommy. Blah blah blah. It's been close to a month since then and I've been following the advice I saw. I lied and said I was going for a drive, she tried to come along but it's a 2-person limit per car and who's looking after the kids then.

I called my dad's best friend, she's a lawyer and told her everything. I screenshotted the texts and sent them to myself, and at night time I asked her to talk and pressed my phone on record and I asked her why she did it and she went on about ""completing our family"" and how we need a third kid and she knows I'll love them more than anything when they're born. She apologized profusely as well, and told me she knew she hadn't gone about it the right way and she should have accepted it and I'm within my rights to do what I want but please stay for the kid, and now that it's on the way we can take it positively.

Anyway, that brings us to today. I'm back on civil terms with my wife and I've started acting like everything's okay between us. She's happy. The kids are happy an excited for their new sibling. Everything's going great except for the divorce being planned. I've got the evidence and I've got the lawyer and I'm preparing to present her with papers. I've talked to my lawyer about how it's going to go because of quarantine, and where we are technology is being used. Online documents and video conferencing, this thing called ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution). 

So that's pretty much it. I've got all my ducks in a row. My wife doesn't know anything. I think I'm doing fine. But I have a lot of doubts. Every day when we go to bed she kisses me and when she thinks I'm asleep she always whispers about how she loves me. Waking up next to her is sad because I know time is running out. She always makes me breakfast in the morning. She hugs me all throughout the day. She's happy and close with me and thinks all our problems are solved and I feel so guilty with what I'm doing. It just feels like everything's going so smoothly, the kids are enjoying quarantine and we're all doing stuff together as a family and I'm just about to drop a nuclear bomb on all this. 

I kind of hate that everything's going so well, and how happy everyone is. I just want to make everything that goes ahead comfortable for my kids, and for my wife. Any advice on how?"
adxude,I [31m] found text messages from my gf [26f] of 3 years to another man including “I love you”. Should I kick her out?,5813,0.95,1120,2019-01-09 00:49:54,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adxude/i_31m_found_text_messages_from_my_gf_26f_of_3/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adxude/i_31m_found_text_messages_from_my_gf_26f_of_3/,self.relationship_advice,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"So this happened a week or two before Christmas. We work opposite schedules so one of us can be at home with our kid at all times. She works weekends (and the occasional week night) at a local children’s hospital and I work 9-5 weekdays. 

I had recently grown suspicious of her “friendship” with this guy she would bring over for play dates because he also has a young daughter. They were texting a lot and making plans to hang out together more and more frequently. 

One Monday night when she had to work I decided to snoop. I logged into her iMessages on the kids iPad and immediately saw that they were regularly texting. She was not texting me at the time but she was texting him, and very flirtatiously. Kissy faces. Heart emojis. All that. Stuff she used to do with me! I kept my cool and kept watching to see how far this actually went. At first I was in shock and couldn’t believe that was actually happening.

By the end of the night I saw it. They exchanged “I love yous” and they spoke of each other as their “missing puzzle piece” while making future plans to hang out together, alone. I still have all the text screenshots saved.

The next morning I brought it up to her and in my anger told her to move out. She claims that she didn’t mean it and she was going to “break it off” with him after Christmas but I find that hard to believe. She also claims they didn’t sleep together but they had hung out together multiple times before without me so who knows. She even bought tickets for them to go to a hockey game together! Plus I don’t know what she’s doing at home when I’m at work all week. 

Part of me wants to believe her and let it go because we have a kid together and it was supposedly just “meaningless words” but shouldn’t she have thought about before she decided to have an emotional affair with another man? She hid it from me so she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong.

The house and bills are in my name because we are not married so she has no legal right to stay here as far as I know (I have consulted with a lawyer already).

Am I blowing this all out of proportion or is forcing her to move out the right thing to do despite how hard it may be?"
fqc5qh,I (29M) don't know how to deal with my obese wife (31F),5791,0.96,965,2020-03-28 08:39:21,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fqc5qh/i_29m_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_obese_wife_31f/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fqc5qh/i_29m_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_obese_wife_31f/,self.relationship_advice,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"The last couple years she has severely been letting herself go, I think it began soon after we were married. I don't know exactly how much she weighs but I'd guess the number begins with a 3. Possibly a 4. It's that bad.

She doesn't seem to care a single bit. 

I've tried everything. There's no way to force an adult to take care of themself so I thought I could at least tighten up my own act. I thought maybe she'd be influenced to start doing what I was. I started paying more attention to my diet by buying healthier foods. I took up an exercise routine and jogging (now I've grown to love this, it's keeping me sane during quarantine.) I didn't need to lose any weight, but I did tone up and feel like I have a lot more energy physically and mentally. When I mention this to my wife she just says that's nice. No interest or connection to herself.

I got more direct eventually by telling her I was worried about her health, but she didn't see why, because ""nothing is wrong"". Well, it is. But somehow she doesn't see it? Literally there's a mirror in our bedroom and the bathroom, and she doesn't realize. She's outgrown multiple clothing sizes. How do you not realize you've gotten THIS big? Being unhealthy doesn't have to look like a medical emergency like a heart attack. There's signs long before that happens and she ignores them. I pointed out how out of breath she gets going up or down stairs, and snoring at night, and bad hygiene, and she either had an excuse or said I was imagining things. She insists she's fine. She won't even walk anywhere except to get food and smells downright nauseating some days! 

Meanwhile every day she eats pretty much all the time, nonstop snacking punctuated by huge portions of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have even woken up to find her snacking in the kitchen in the middle of the night. On average she doesn't go more than an hour or two without eating something. All the snacks are junk food, the meals are either healthy things I cook for the both of us or fast food delivery. 

Since I'm now working remotely I've been able to see over the past couple weeks just how much she eats while I'm at work. This is her usual routine. She always said she didn't eat much during the day because she preferred to eat more at dinner once I was home. But that's not what I've seen. She goes out daily to the corner store for junk food and soda.

My problems are that she doesn't really clean up her trash and food that falls on the floor, the mess and sound of her eating is distracting while I'm trying to work unless I work in the bedroom, speaking of the bedroom it's getting hard to sleep comfortably because of how much space she takes up (sometimes I've been sleeping on the couch), also we obviously don't have sex, and I find myself being attracted to other women. I would never cheat, I just wish my wife was someone I could have a sexual relationship with. We used to, and it was great, before all this started.

Also the laziness and dismissive attitude, is something I really dislike. Does she simply not care? Is that all it is?? I keep thinking there's gotta be some REASON. It can't simply be this is just what she wants to be. No one WANTS to be this fat. I mean right?? And yes I've asked. She has a neverending supply of excuses and denials, but no explanation.

Lastly she has no sense of finances. I feel used sometimes because she'll spend money on whatever food she wants and the amount has steadily gone up over the years. She won't get a job because she thinks she's disabled (I don't believe this), but refuses to go to any doctor so therefore has no diagnosis to make her eligible for disability payments. I wish she had some form of income, I don't care what it is.

Also, what's finally pushing me to write this is her opinions have gotten more extreme the more weight she's gained. She's sometimes hateful towards people for no reason. For example she has made racist comments about how covid-19 is ""because Asians eat gross shit."" And refusing to be in the same vicinity as anyone Asian. That didn't stop her from ordering enough takeout for 3 people tonight from a Chinese place. I don't tolerate racism and I've shut this down when she starts saying it. Now I'm just wondering why can I not do the same thing with the obesity. 

What do I do about her? Is there any chance for getting through that she needs to stop all of this, and now, or do you think it's hopeless?

TL;DR: Don't know what to do about my wife refusing to lose weight and being lazy and other things."
ch8hrv,[UPDATE] I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,5775,0.81,624,2019-07-24 19:25:44,relationship_advice,13741346,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch8hrv/update_i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch8hrv/update_i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than/,self.relationship_advice,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i\_32m\_make\_significantly\_more\_money\_than\_my\_new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cgcwwy/i_32m_make_significantly_more_money_than_my_new/)

Hello, it's me. Sorry about the new username, I made the first account thinking I would just post & read the replies, so I couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. Didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&#x200B;

It seems folks were split on whether I was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. I think it was probably a little of both. After spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and I probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. It wasn't meant to be condescending, I just want to share my newfound wealth with the people I care about. But, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. In the future, I will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&#x200B;

This is kind of a non-update, but I wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that I will take your advice and ease up a bit. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. A couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday I texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and I quote), ""Yes, of course! Budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&#x200B;

Color me skeptical. But she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

&#x200B;

One more thing, to everyone who thinks I just came on here to brag about my wealth: the next time you're rolled into the OR, you'll be glad to have a competent, well-paid anesthesiologist in the room to take care of you. We're the ones monitoring your vitals and keeping you in a controlled state of death while the surgeons operate, so if you've had surgery and didn't wake up with your chest cavity open, thank an anesthesiologist!"

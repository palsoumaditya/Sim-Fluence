I went to the pyramids of Giza and they were truly majestic, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without being harassed and hustled by the many of the touts trying to sell things or services. They were trying to sell me camel and horse rides, trying to give me a guided tour, trying to sell me worthless crap trinkets, trying to take my phone from me and take pictures of me and my family and then demanding an absurd amount of money.

One guy that I got on top of his camel for pictures asked for money so I gave him $10 USD and he started yelling and screaming at me asking for $100 USD. I thought he is going to attack me, my family and I just quickly ran away from him.

My family member got her phone snatched and the guy took pictures of her telling her to make all these poses, and then he wouldn't give the phone back to her until she paid him $20 and then he kept complaining about how $20 is nothing and that he deserves more.

One guy came up to me to pose in a picture with me and I told him to go away but he wouldn't. He stayed in the picture while my family member was taking the pictures and then he asked for money, I got so extremely mad and I screamed at him at the top of my lungs to go away. All of the other travelers around there heard and were looking and then only did the guy go away.

Then trying to walk around Giza and Cairo, just forget about it. It's virtually impossible. All of the touts coming up to us and asking if we need a ride, or if we can buy their whatever shit trinkets they are selling. We couldn't walk more than literally 60 seconds without someone new coming to harass us.

What is it about this place that makes visitors feel so unwelcome? Why do they do this? There is so much rich history and culture to Egypt that I am sure everyone all around the world would want to visit, but why do the touts push us away instead of making us feel welcome?

When I came back to the US and all my coworkers asked me how it was, I told them the pyramids and temples were amazing, but the touts were absolutely horrible. I told them not to go, and that I would never step my foot back in Egypt ever again."

She loved the country, spoke Turkish, and returned nearly every year. She took me there about 20 years ago and as a 12 year old, I really loved it. 

Fast forward these past two decades and I’m so excited to take my spouse there. I am now sitting at IST feeling completely the opposite. Here is just a small section of why I felt so scammed by nearly the entire experience in only 3 days:

- The airport approved taxi with fixed price tried to rip us off for 3x the fixed price into Istanbul. He locked the doors when I refused to pay the inflated price and threatened to call the police. I managed to get the locked door open and leave the agreed upon payment on the seat. 

- We had the “tourist price” menus constantly given to us with massive price gouging. Then when a Turkish friend joined us for dinner, we found out what was happening. Not to mention the constant yelling and cajoling of street scammers trying to get their next victim. 

- My spouse fell for the common shoe shine scam. This is my fault for not warning her so shame on me. She is also the nicest person I know so it feels even worse. But this guy actually ended up reaching into her bag and grabbing her wallet and removing 20€ (all that was in it thankfully) before running off. So aggressive. 

- I wanted to take a photo of the building where my great-grandfather worked. It used to be an embassy, but is now a social club. I was angrily screamed at and told to leave despite being on a public sidewalk. I tried to explain why I wanted a photo using Google translate and the “security man” only screamed more and threatened to call the cops unless I paid him. I just ended up walking away and into the hotel across the street. 
- We just wanted to buy some Turkish delight to take home to my spouse’s mother. The shop owner charged us 4x what was told to us it would be when he wrapped it up. He threatened to call the cops if we didn’t pay, so we did, and now I am contesting the charge with the credit card company. We are two women in a foreign country so it’s not like we are going to keep arguing with some random man we don’t know.

- Our hotel demanded we pay half our room in cash and were pressuring us at check out to write a “five star” review online while standing there. Constant two-faced behaviour, especially when the wifi stopped working and the lift went out. 

- Finally, let’s just even look at this airport. The view that every foreigner is a piggy bank continues. 22€ for a f***ing burger at Burger King even at an inflated airport price is insane. There are not that many places to fill up water bottles either, so I suppose it’s 10€ for a bottle or just dehydrate yourself! Oh, and want internet? You only get it for an hour and you have to go get a special password! World’s best airport? Maybe world’s best scam airport. 

I’ve lived in multiple Global South countries and never have I been so eager to leave a place, even where less developed than Türkiye so this is not some “western tourist” issue. Türkiye really has an issue on its hands and it is very lucky it has such beautiful and significant historical and religious sites to encourage people to come. It seemed every time we left our hotel we were barraged with scammers viewing two Dutch blonde women as being rich. One of us is a school teacher and the other works in international development so we are not flush with cash. From start to finish, I felt extremely sad and guilty for feeling so upset and angry since this was my grandmother’s favourite place. I pride myself in being culturally respectful and sensitive, but even trying to take a step back and looking at it all from their perspective didn’t help. I would never dream of scamming anyone out of money while also pretending to be kind. Another box of worms: these guys scam, never face any consequences, but me, the gay person, has to pretend not to be while I’m in the country to be respectful of the homophobic culture and protect myself from being the victim of discrimination and crime. Makes total sense. 

For a country that wants so badly to be part of the European community, shame on it for supporting and tolerating this culture of scam. I’ve travelled plenty throughout countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, etc. also wanting to be in the European Union and never once felt like every move was vulnerable to being scammed. 

I have many Turkish friends in the Netherlands and now fully understand why they wouldn’t want to live in Türkiye. I understand this population of scammers represents a small portion of Turkish people and most people are good, but the country needs to stop allowing this sort of culture. Tons of police officers stand around doing nothing. There’s almost no way to report this sort of thing to be taken seriously. These men are allowed to yell from their shops and overcharge “idiot” foreigners. 

I really supported the country before this, but now I will never come back to this country that my grandmother loved so dearly. I really am heartbroken.

I've been here before but not them so she thought it'd Also be nice for me to guide them around for a bit.
 My cousin is the pickiest eater I have ever had the displeasure of travelling with. Such a royal pain in the butt. For her, even jokbal (pork trotters) is too ""exotic and weird"". We passed by a dakgalbi restaurant and she also refused because she's worried it'll be spicy (it's literally not...). We had a delicious kbbq dinner but she only ate plain meat and rice because she refused to eat any of the free side dishes. She sulked the whole dinner and we had to go to Subway after that. What about Korean fried chicken? Who doesn't like that?? HER.
The most irritating and audacious thing happened today. We went to a Korean Chinese restaurant and I ordered my favourite jajangmyeon, my aunt ordered jjampong and cousin ordered... dumplings. Yay. Something she's willing to eat. When my jajangmyeon came, she looked at it with disgust and let out a silent ""Eww"". And at some point even said something along the lines of ""that looks disgusting"" ""you really like that?"" ...I was really annoyed and pissed at that point but I didn't want to get angry on vacation so I just said ""Yeah it actually tastes better than it looks, want some?"" She shook her head and didn't say anything else. I just found her comments so stupid and uncalled
for because I spent some time on the map app searching for restaurants that has food her stupid palate can handle. 
Anyways we're fortunately parting ways tomorrow as I am moving to Suwon and then Busan so I can't wait to enjoy the rest of my trip eating all my favourite Korean food and she can eat all the sandwiches she want. I don't care if I sound childish or petty because I just needed to let this out because I've been so sick of her.

Korea is amazing though I highly recommend. "

I am from Europe. The Netherlands specifically.

This is not my first time in the US but it is my most extensive. It strikes me how vastly different the USA is compared to my country or Europe in general.

I'd just like to give my thoughts here from a European perspective. Which things I think are better here and which are worse. I am also keeping this limited to a tourist perspective, so I'm going to stay away from things that are only relevant when I would actually live here, like healthcare, taxes and politics.

I am aware that the vast majority of Reddit users are American. I do not intend to offend in any way. Just putting my personal opinions here.

Thinks I like

* Nature. Raw, wild and untouched and - most of all - VAST. The sheer vastness AND variety of nature and pure wilderness here is definitely unmatched in Europe. Specifically the little nature we have in The Netherlands is laughable compared to the USA.
* People are generally approachable and friendly. Yes I do like Americans, at least their overall demeanor. I would be greeted and asked where I'm from even by someone at the 7 eleven. In general Dutch people are quire rude.
* Free refills! This is a small thing but really unheard of in the Netherlands. In my country you pay the same price for just one tiny cup of coffee. In fact, all drinks you order are tiny in The Netherlands and you pay for each one.
* Traffic lights across the street. I can't for the life of my understand why we still have to lean over the steering wheel and get a sore neck looking straight upwards at the traffic lights in Europe.
* The doggy bag. You MIGHT be able to get to take your leftover with you in certain places in The Netherlands, but it really not the norm and would surely raise an eyebrow if you ask. Here it is normal and I find it very good to not let the food go to waste. Besides, I did pay for it so its nice to be able to take it with me.

Things I don't like

* Tipping! Why the heck do I need to be partly responsible for a proper salary for these people? Also it is just annoying to have to calculate the tip every time. It is also annoying that listed prices are almost exclusively without tax. In my country - and across most of Europe as far as I'm aware - you pay exactly what is listed as the price. No hidden surprises.
* The food, especially breakfast. Almost everything contains sugar. Breakfast is never with fresh bread and fresh good meats and cheese. In fact American cheese is awful, but maybe I'm spoiled living in cheese country. For dinner the food isn't quite as bad, but its still nowhere near the quality and variety that you find in Europe.
* Plastic! Too much plastic is a problem in Europe also, but the amount of plastic (and styrofoam or other disposable crap) used here is bizarre. I also find it really bizarre that in every hotel breakfast its all disposable cutlery and plates also. You really NEVER see this in Europe, not even in the cheapest hotels.
* Imperial measurements. Gallons, miles, feet and especially Fahrenheit is so bizarre. Also because the conversion factor to metric is odd. Almost all the world, as well as the scientific world, uses metric which makes so much more sense in every way. Why does the US hold on to such an archaic system?

So here are some of my thoughts. Feel free to add your own, or tell me where you agree or disagree. I'd love to read the same perspective from Americans who have visited Europe."

I used to LOVE AirB’nB. In fact, I haven’t stayed in hotels since 2016, always choosing AirB’n’Bs instead. I always found them simply better quality — more space and utilities for less money. However, now…sadly I think some precious part of the AirB’nB magic is gone. It’s like it sold its soul. 

The last place I stayed in (November, 2022) had a pretty high cleaning fee AND I was left with a list of chores to do before I left. Actually, I’m neat and tidy so I clean up anyway but what got me most was the little laminated signs hung up everywhere. They all said “If you use it, YOU CLEAN IT”. The last part was in all caps, bolded and underlined. It was like being stuck in a passive aggressive employee break room. Yucky.

And the worst thing is, I felt compelled to keep this feedback private for fear of retaliation from the host. 

AirB’nB have either failed to see this trend coming, or they think its negligible from a business point of view. I guess the gradual swing away from AirB’nB isn’t hurting their balance sheet enough…yet. 

It reminds me a little of the way eBay went. Once upon a time eBay had charm and was all about peer-to-peer commerce. Then all the mass-produced items flooded the site and it’s just a poor substitute for Amazon.

Edit to add: a helpful commenter shared this: https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-is-introducing-total-price-display-and-updating-guest-checkout/
Seems AirB’nB is at least trying to tackle some of the issues. 

Edit also to add: yeah, I know I spell AirB’nB weird now. 😂"

Within the first few hours, thanks to the extremely negligent (bordering on the reckless) decisions of the company and guide (edit: see company name below), we were completely lost deep in the Amazon jungle with no food, water or any safety supplies. Guide had collapsed from exhaustion and lay down to die, refusing to get up. Rescue was nothing short of a miracle. Full story is below - Any thoughts on how to make the company take some sort of responsibility are appreciated.

——

My brother (21M) and I (27F) have always wanted to do a trip into the jungle, so planned an entire itinerary in Peru around doing so. We looked at a few different online tours, and booked a two-night tour leaving from Iquitos and going into the Amazon. The tour was one of the less luxurious options but had very good reviews so we felt it was a safe choice. We spent the days leading up to it in Lima procuring and stocking our day packs with safety supplies (correct clothing and gear, strong insect repellent, flashlights, medicines) and researching how to be safe. We were worried about lethal snake or spider bites, jaguars, caimans, mosquito-borne diseases etc, but the golden rule from all of the advice online was to always trust and follow your guide and you’ll be safe, as they know the jungle and will always cut a safe path for you and point out dangers. Thousands of people do Amazon tours every year and have a great time. We were really excited.

On the day the trip was starting, we met at the office in Iquitos and then took a boat for about an hour and a half down the Amazon river. The small group doing our tour included our guide (Peruvian \~35M but seemed to speak good English), a young girl who seemed to serve no purpose except to accompany him, and a mother and daughter (\~55F and 30F), the latter of which spoke fluent English and Spanish.

The boat made a couple of five minute stops along the way, firstly to get some gas and then to let some other guests off. It stopped a third time at about 11am and our guide motioned for us to get off. We thought we must be starting the tour so picked up our bags, but he told us to leave our bags on the boat. We assumed this was just another five minute stop. We asked if we needed our gumboots, and he said no.

We follow him off the boat. When we get up the river bank, he looks at our empty hands and asks “do you not have any water?” We were extremely confused as he had told us to leave our things on the boat and hadn’t explained what we were doing. He says “don’t worry, we are just doing a short 20-minute walk down the the track to a local village so you'll be fine.” The guide didn't have any water either. My brother and I are a bit concerned, but by the time we turn around the boat has already left with our stuff (including our water, carefully chosen repellent etc), so we trust that we only have a short period of walking and we follow the guide down the track into the jungle.

The first 20 minutes are lovely and the guide is exemplary of what we had read online, pointing out interesting insects and telling us which ones to avoid, and showing us the safe places to step. At some point though, he leads us off the track and into the deep jungle. I’m completely unconcerned and assuming this is all part of the plan. He tells us later that this is because he came across a large fallen tree over the track and we had to go around it.

Things start to go a bit awry from here. We walk through the deep jungle for an hour or so, and our guide is becoming less responsible. He’s charging ahead and leaving us to cut our own path (he doesn’t have a machete or delicate instructions of where to step like the guides we read about online). We have to clamber over trunks, under vines, avoid vicious ants, and get stuck in mud. Luckily we didn’t encounter anything more deadly; god knows it was definitely lurking. The mother who was with us fell over a few times and the guide didn't seem to care.

Eventually we make it to a small clearing and are starting to get a bit fed up, given we are yet to reach the village and are getting hungry, thirsty, sweaty, muddy and bitten. But, we are relieved to be out of the thick forest. The clearing has a basic bamboo shelter, and a little stream with two small aluminium boats. Is this the village? Our guide tells us to wait here and disappears for another half an hour without communicating anything to us, which is extremely irritating. He eventually returns and explains that we have to go back as “the boat that was meant to pick us up isn’t there”, which doesn’t make any sense as we thought we were heading to a village. He says it will be 20 minutes maximum to get back to the river and, to our relief, starts leading us along a small dirt track. At this point (probably around 2pm) we just want to get back ASAP - we’re hungry and thirsty. To our dismay, he shortly leads us off the track again back into the jungle, pointing at the sun and saying that he can tell which direction the river is in. Although annoyed that we have to wade through mud again, I still at this point have no suspicion that we are lost, and trust that he knows exactly where he’s taking us. My brother isn’t so sure, and says to us “if he’s using the sun as navigation I’m not that confident about this”. The rest of us laugh and follow our guide as all of the online advice told us to do. Stick with the guide, you’ll be fine.

We stumble our way through the deep jungle without any assistance. By now, the guide is charging so far ahead that we can barely see him and have to keep yelling out to him. We are being bitten by red ants which is very painful, falling over and wading through mud, where we could hear running water bubbling underneath us. At one point, I fell thigh-deep into a muddy swamp and screamed, half expecting a caiman to bite my legs off (our gumboots would have come in handy if we hadn't been told leave them behind). The guide did not seem to care. At this point we scream to him to slow the fuck down and wait for us because this is extremely dangerous. He eventually does and stops to talk to us, saying that we should wait here (in the middle of nowhere) and his colleague will bring us food and water. Again, we are confused. He then leaves again into the jungle before we can stop him. We are in disbelief.  We look around and there is dense forest/swamp in all directions and we are being constantly bitten by mosquitos. We don't want to wait here for long, especially without water and repellent.

He returns a few minutes later looking extremely exhausted, having taken off his shirt, and collapses onto the forest floor. Between desperate gasps for breath, he finally drops the act and admits he has no idea where we are. We are completely lost.

It soon becomes clear that we have been lost for hours. We figure the guide was charging ahead to try and find a familiar path and completely exhausted himself doing so. He has collapsed shirtless on a muddy log, with loads of insects biting him. He is too exhausted to care. He is delirious and completely incoherent, seemingly forgetting how to speak English except to ask for water (which we didn’t have) - luckily the daughter in our group could translate for us, because he managed to get a bit of phone reception and called his boss. We learned from her that he could not explain to his boss where on earth we were. He was even trying to describe the clearing with the two boats (which the boss did not recognise), showing that we were already lost all the way back then, and he had tried to hide it from us all that time. He had nothing with him to prepare for this situation: no flare, no water, no machete, no GPS, not even a compass.

We spend the next hour or so trying to think logically about how to survive. We got the guide’s phone password and contacts as it seemed that we were going to lose him at any minute. Although I didn’t have reception, my google map had partially loaded so that we could perhaps see the direction of the river and hack through the jungle to make our way to it and hopefully flag someone down. I was nervous about doing this because (1) it meant leaving the guide (who kept insisting he couldn't stand), leaving us without his knowledge of the jungle but also leaving him to die; (2) I really doubted whether the map was correct and (3) it would mean hours navigating the thick jungle by ourselves, risking encountering deadly animals, dangerous tribes, anything. And, we probably only had an hour of sunlight left...

We were all extremely thirsty and were trying not to panic, but things were not looking good. It was extremely hot and muddy, mosquitoes were flying everywhere, and we were on constant alert for snakes, spiders, jaguars etc. Everyone remained extremely calm and thought logically which was a blessing (the mother and I shared a hug; I think she suspected I was about to get upset), and we were so lucky to have the other two in our group, but it was looking like we were going to have to try and survive the night (or longer) in the Amazon jungle without water, without a guide, and without any of our supplies.

The daughter then manages to get a bit of reception on her phone and can speak directly to the boss herself, although we still have no way of describing our whereabouts. We send him a screenshot of my half-loaded map image. She contacts her boyfriend and tells him that she will likely die in the jungle and that she loves him, but can he please contact the authorities asap. We ask our guide what the emergency number in Peru is and he brazenly refuses to tell us (I guess because he was worried about getting in trouble). So does his pointless girlfriend.

We discuss our options, including the risk of leaving the guide behind, as he is still refusing to move or offer any advice despite our pleas. We eventually decide that, because the sun is going down and because of the risks associated with trying to get to the river, we are safer trying to go back the way we came and at least find the dirt track, which is safer from nature than the deep jungle and which also has a better chance of someone coming along the track and finding us. My brother is confident that he can remember the way back (I’m not). The guide, realising that we are about to leave him here on his own, gets a new lease of life and we are able to heave him to his feet. He stumbles ahead behind my brother, and I’m at the back with the other three girls. We are all trying not to break down.

Eventually, dozens of ant stings later, we hear a faint motor engine in the distance. We start screaming for help at the top of our lungs. To our dismay, it sounds like it has gone past without hearing us, but then we hear the noise stop. We keep screaming for our lives until, a few minutes later, we hear voices coming towards us through the jungle. We start crying with relief. Six villagers reach us, drag us back through the jungle, and load us onto a tray on the back of a motorbike, with water and biscuits. We learn that they are from one of the jungle villages who were contacted to go out looking for us, which is why they were on the track.

I think by now it’s about 4pm. The guide has  attempts to explain what happened, stating that he has over a decade of experience in the jungle and this has never happened before. We tell him that we just want to go home. He starts off saying it’s not possible to get back to Iquitos tonight and that we will need to stay at the jungle lodge with him, but we won’t take no for an answer. We don’t trust him one bit with our safety. He eventually agrees to arrange for a boat to take us back.

We ride on the back of the motorbike for about half an hour, over bumpy terrain and occasionally getting stuck in the mud (it seems like this track hasn't been used in a long time). We are still being bitten by ants - my brother has hundreds stuck in his trousers. But we are all so thankful to be alive.

On our journey back, we learn that my map image was completely wrong and that it seemed to be a snapshot of my last downloaded location many hours ago. We also learn that the villagers on the bike didn’t hear our screams over the motor - one of them happened to fall off at the exact right time, so they stopped the bike to let him back on and that’s when they heard us.

From speaking to locals and looking online, it seems like this is the first time a guided tour from Iquitos has got lost in the Amazon.

We eventually got back to the office expecting apologies and compensation. Obviously, the money is not important at all when compared to our survival. But, to our huge surprise, the boss said we couldn’t get our money back because “it’s already been spent on the lodge”. We argued and argued and he eventually agreed to give us some in cash back now and another portion later to our bank account, but we won’t see that in our account for a couple of weeks and even then it would only be a bit over half what we paid. He basically called our bluff on bringing them to justice. He only gave the other two about half of theirs back as well. We ended up giving up as he was being pretty menacing and we felt unsafe, and just wanted to get the next flight out of there.

Of course we plan to write a bad review for the company but we want to see the money first, although might cut our losses on that. We just feel like it’s perverse that we were left to die in the jungle in extremely dangerous circumstances and it was completely the fault of the company that we put our trust in. They were severely negligent sending us with an incompetent guide without any supplies for the worst case scenario (which is what eventuated). It was an absolute death trap. We are still very shaken by the whole experience (this happened 4 days ago). And are also sad to have not had the adventure we dreamed about for ages.

Although we were still a few hours or days off dying of thirst, the scary part was the prospect of having to survive the night, or longer, in the jungle alongside all the horrors of the Amazon and still being no closer to being found.

One of our group videoed the entire thing. We are hoping to get the footage from her and can post the link once we do.

Any thoughts on what we can do are welcome. Thanks for reading!

EDIT:

Name of tour company: Canopy Tours Iquitos

Itinerary and trip we booked was called Iquitos: Amazon Expedition 3 days, can find the itinerary on Get Your Guide, seems to not let me post with the link but should come up with a google and had good reviews on there.

EDIT 2: we booked directly through the company’s website after finding itinerary and reviews on GYG, their website can be found online too"

Restaurants, ok I get it.. the going rate now is 18% minimum so it’s not small change. We were paying $30 minimum on top of each meal. 

It was asking if we wanted to tip at places where we queued up and bought food from the till, the card machine asked if we wanted to tip 18%, 20% or 25%. 

This is what I don’t understand, I’ve queued up, placed my order, paid for a service which you will kindly provide.. ie food and I need to tip YOU for it? 

Then there’s cabs, hotel staff, bar staff, even at breakfast which was included they asked us to sign a blank $0 bill just so we had the option to tip the staff. So wait another $15 per day? 

Are US folk paid worse than the UK? I didn’t find it cheap over there and the tipping culture has gone mad to me."

Dear god, what a mistake. If this post can deter anybody from going and spending money in this country, it served its purpose. I’ve never been anywhere where the general population was so misogynistic and disrespectful to women. You are completely and blatantly lied to and ripped off by everyone everywhere - regardless of how “savvy” of a traveler you think you are. When you are not dealing with that you are battling constant food poisoning despite ""playing it safe"" and eating in the higher end hotels (Sofitel, Marriott, etc). The street food in Southeast Asia is safer. The joke is truly on the tourists who choose to come here. Want to go to the Pyramids? Prepare to get harassed and haggled into getting on a dying horse that will be beaten and whipped to keep moving. Want to go inside the Pyramids? Prepare to be cornered and shaken down for everything in your wallet. The same goes for Karnak and The Valley of the Kings in Luxor. Make sure you don’t go into any corners or tight spots because the people “working” there will block you and make you pay them. Sharm El Sheikh? If you are a diver than the red sea is beautiful, everything else including the hotel is an absolute Russian wasteland (my wife is Russian I can say this). Think it’s cheap? Speak English and your prices are pinged to the dollar. Even the doctor at the Sofitel in Cairo will charge you $300 USD for a covid test (costs around $80 USD everywhere else). I consider myself a savvy traveler and I have been all over the middle east, some places better than others. This is the worst place I have ever been to and I highly recommend you pick another destination. A real tragedy for 50% of Egyptians who are nice people, because the other 50% have ruined the country. I am a male in my 30's."

I was a bit annoyed at the condescending tone, as I told them that my vacation is ending soon and I have to go back to work the day after I land home. We can’t all afford to leave our jobs as and when we please. We, the miserable 9-5 people, keep the economy going so people like you you can afford to do this whimsy take after the wind travel you so desire. I used to work in hospitality and received an average of 20 emails a day from travel bloggers who wants a stay for free in exchange of a shitty blog and Instagram post. I usually read their ‘about’ page and they’re ALL the same - they left their deskbound job la la la, they want to see the world la la la. Like I too travel and see the world AND get to keep my day job. What makes you special?? 

Don’t look down on the 9-5 folks and assume we are all miserable. I keep this steady job because it allows me to be wild and fancy outside of it."

From the moment we landed to the moment we left-

Endless street harassment! For what it’s worth- we’re seasoned travelers who have been to over 20 countries, and coming from an even poorer country myself it was appalling the level of antagonizing we got while there!

To start of with the good- I have never seen anything as incredible as the pyramids, or the temples in Luxor. Like I couldn’t wrap my head around how something that beautiful and precise count have been made. Especially Hatshepsut temple. Definitely worthy of all the bad we endured. But holy hell, my partner and I were saying how, at the end of 4 days, we would never want to go back.

The usual camel hawkers and the knee selling junky items for 10x the price didn’t bother us. We got a tour guide which was fine but he went so fast. So we came back the next day on our own to try and slow down and enjoy. Well we were walking around and an official looking guy in a suit blew his whistle and was like “ticket”? To which already paid. He went on the whole spiel about how he’s a friend, waved us through , and then tried to push us through the”correct “ pathway. We followed and of course immediately cornered us and asked for money. Gave him $5 usd and he was like “give me more. I see another $5” to which we refused. To anyone who said we should have been smarter- there’s a ton of police around the pyramids, if someone blows a whistle at you, you stop and comply; you don’t expect it to be some scumbag.


The most egregious one was in the airport, we had to pass a tunnel to get to our terminal. It was really early so it as just my partner running around. An official airport security man asked for his passport (normal) where he was going , and at the end REFUSED TO GIVE THE PASSPORT BACK AND JUST HELD OUT HIS HAND EXPECTING MONEY. Said nothing, because he knew my partner was alone and would not make a fuss.gave him $1 usd bc he was holding the passport hostage and again he had the audacity to say, that’s it?


We had people follow us for several hundred feet to our car asking us to buy shit. That’s annoying as hell and out of sheer spite I refused to buy anything.  The whole dropping you off at some crappy papyrus/essence/stone store at the end of the tour put a really bad taste in my mouth although I know we could say no. EVERYONE was all “my friend my friend” but no one treated us with genuine kindness when we needed help.

We ran out of cash but only had a credit card-  no one at the bank would help. We desperately asked a restaurant- well they did, but at a 15% fee AND MORE TIP FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE on top of that. Knowing damn well the actual cash advance fee is 5% at most and they pocketed the rest.

Then they have their women and children monopolizing most toilets, handing you paper towels you didn’t ask for in one hand, hand out reached for tip in another. For effing paper towels that I can just get myself.


Unfortunately my pity for them is mixed with resentment and anger. Poverty is no reason to be dishonorable, that is an absolute insult to poor people everywhere.

But at the end I was getting terrified that we couldn’t leave, someone would extort us, and we’d be stuck in this country. At one point, we even drafted an email to the us embassy for help bc we were stranded without money (had lots of credit cards though) 

Asking us embassy for help! Who would have thought we’d have to resort to that!"

I feel I really got into the lifestyle there. Sitting outside to eat on summer nights. Walking and taking transit everywhere. Seeing people outside everywhere partaking in the city. Enjoying the historic charm that is in abundance, feeling safe everywhere at all hours(maybe with the exception of Marseilles and parts of London), etc. 

I feel like the US in comparison is just...underwhelming. I currently live in Nashville and most of my life have lived in Los Angeles. I want to move to a new city but really don't like any city in the US enough to be excited about going there. And it seems the only places in America that might give you a slice of that European lifestyle are prohibitively expensive, like San Francisco or NYC.

I feel like most Americans cities are sprawling, bland, built around cars, terrible transit, unsafe. A few years ago I was walking through downtown Atlanta on a weekend in the afternoon and was stunned that there were no people walking other than me. It was like the city had been abandoned. I could not imagine the center of a European city being completely empty of pedestrians. There is more vibrancy in a European city of 200,000 than in an American city of 2 million. 

After the architectural splendor of Prague and Edinburgh. the Mediterranean charm of old town Nice, eating in the medieval alleyways of Croatia, I come back to America and feel kind of depressed at the landscape of strip malls, drive-thru Starbucks, urban blight, sprawling suburbs with cookie cutter houses and no sidewalks or pedestrians in sight. Maybe one little historic ""old town"" street downtown that you have to drive into and that's full of souvenir shops and chain restaurants. 

I guess I'm just ranting and experiencing post-vacation blues, but I'm missing the European lifestyle so much it hurts and I'm having difficulty adjusting to America. I liked just about every European city I visited. There are very few American cities I'd bother visiting unless I had a specific reason to go there. 

On the plus side, the variety of natural scenery in the US, particularly the western US rivals anything in Europe and maybe surpasses it. And increasingly I'd rather rent a cabin in some place like the Smoky Mountains or Sierras in California than visit the cities."

We fly out of Italy and have a layover in Frankfurt before heading back to the states. We are wondering what to expect at the airport. Will Italy be the determining authority on this since it’s where we initially fly out of or will we be questioned in Germany as well? What is the likelihood of a fine, ban, or worse punishment. 

Any advice or info would be great, thanks y’all

EDIT: for everyone wondering if we intentionally did this, no. We traveled to Morocco for two days thinking that would reset our 90 days which we obviously now know it does not. Yes we were stupid and should’ve looked more into it before assuming.

UPDATE: we changed our flight to go directly from Italy to the US. It departs tomorrow 9/16 in the morning. I will post another update after going through security.

UPDATE 2: just made it through security. No fine, no deportation, no ban, no gulag. No one even said a word to us. They didn’t scan our passport just stamped it. Cheers y’all"

I’ve stayed in probably 10 hotels this year and all of the nice 4-5 star hotels have switched their showers to these weird open concept stalls. Sometimes it comes with three and a half ish walls but other times it’s just a slanted floor and a shower head in the corner of the bathroom. 

Who has asked for this? Why are we trying to make showers modern art? I want four walls that close off. I want to not be huddled in the corner of the shower trying to find the position that jets the least amount of water in the rest of the bathroom area where I’m about to spend the next 20 minutes getting ready and trying not to slip and fall on new, sneaky puddles. I want to be brushing my teeth at the sink and not get sprayed with the rogue shower head by my husband trying to find the right position too. 

Trash concept, get rid of them. "

She exited the subway car while her little sister yelled ""No, wrong stop!"" and everyone in the train looked. It took a second but my wife realized what was happening and tried to get off too but she was slowed by the packed crowd (our kids had gone to sit down, so we were separated a bit.) She shouted ""Stay at that station!"" A young guy by the door heard the commotion and jumped out the doors right before they closed.

Early in the trip, we had told my daughter if we got separated to wait at the next station and we would come get her. So, my wife got out at the next stop with my younger daughter and I rode the subway going the other direction back a station. 

Back one station, I saw the young guy standing with my daughter. After checking if she was OK, I bowed deeply to the young guy and said ""Arigato Gozaimasu"". But he was barely paying any attention to me: Someone else had gotten off the subway with me, the young guy's friend I presume, and they were pointing at each other and laughing. The young guy must have texted his friend to tell him to come back a station as he had unexpectedly gotten off the train to help my daughter.

My daughter told me she had cried a bit but then the young guy used Google translate to have her try to call me but she  forgot to dial the country code so the call failed. He then tried to take her to the station master but the station was unmanned. Then they just came back to the platform to wait for me.

The four of us (young guy, his friend, my daughter and me) hopped back onto the train going in the original direction again. I tried talking to the guy but he didn't speak English and we couldn't pull out our phones for Google Translate as it was too crowded and we were both holding stuff.

Thank you young guy for providing company and comfort to my daughter when she got lost! I feel bad I was unable to express my gratitude appropriately due to language barrier. He was very nonchalant and humble about the whole thing but it really meant the world to me and her. Travelling in foreign places, when your are most confused and lost, you meet the nicest people.

After that, my older daughter was really slow getting off the subway."

Southwest Airlines cancelled nearly 2,000 flights this weekend, citing ""weather"" as the issue, when other airlines were flying to Florida just fine.

We’ve just finished up an awesome 2 month trip around Europe, ending the last week in Amsterdam. We of course got amongst the coffee shops in amsterdam and had a few joints here and there and I forgot that I stored one in my backpack. When I ‘double checked’ my back pack before heading to the airport, i didn’t find the joint as I didn’t even realise I had one in there, as I thought I must have smoked it. Low and behold, we go through security at Dubai, which we were planning on a hop on hop off tour as we had a 15 hour layover, and the security guard pulls out none other than the joint i had forgotten was in there. No good. Spent most of the day getting finger printed, questioned and searched to the point I’m now being deported and never allowed back in the UAE. If this was 2 years ago I would be locked up for 4 years minimum, so I consider myself lucky. This goes for anyone buying weed or any other substance that may be legal where you buy it, do NOT store them in a difficult-to-find pocket in your backpack and forget about it. And before I get flamed saying this was just stupid, I already know, I’ve heard it all day.      EDIT: I would just like to clarify for the people accusing me of ignorance about taking weed to a country that it’s not allowed. I didn’t do it intentionally and I never would. I put this joint in my bag at the start of the week in amsterdam. I had even bought more joints throughout the week as I thought I didn’t have any left, because I forgot about the one in my bag. I may be stupid for forgetting it, but I’m not a complete asshole with a lack of respect on laws of other countries. It was an honest mistake, which I have paid for. I do not need people telling me “next time just don’t do that.” No shit. It wasn’t mean to happen in the first place."

And I paid for it with giant blisters on my feet so bad I could not walk without limping. I told her about it during dinner yesterday and thought nothing of it (although it was broken Spanish). Well today she hands me a tube of creme, and explains that it was to help heal my feet, and how to use it. 

I won't lie I almost cried right there. This sweet woman, who I haven't been able to talk to very well, cared enough to buy this for me. When I went to my room I was curious and looked into it.

Y'all... She went to her doctor to get this for me.

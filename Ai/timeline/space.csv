___________________________________________


I ordered a 'Moonbox' from NASA contractor Astrobotic last October. Essentially, I purchased a very small area of cargo space to send something to the Moon. 

In it I'm planning to put two 1TB microSD cards for a project of mine. This ended up being *way* more space than the project required. One of the cards is completely empty!

Therefore **I'm giving out 10MB of storage space for free on a first come, first serve, limited supply basis.** Again, I'm doing this *completely* for free and asking for nothing in return. 

**If you are interested in sending up to 10MB of data to the Moon for free:**

    1. Your Reddit account must have been created prior to January 25th, 2021.
    2. You can send 10MB in images, video, audio, and/or text. It's up to you how you want to divide this up, but please keep submissions within 10MB. I'm happy to compress your files if you know a compressed version is <10mb
    3. Submissions that are..
        3a. Images/Video/Audio must be loaded to an image host such as imgur.com or a video host such as vimeo.com. You would send me the link to the Image/Video/Audio file when you're ready to make your submission.
        3b. Text can be commented below or sent in a PM to me. Just make it clear by saying you want your message sent to the Moon.
    4. All submissions must be SFW & legal. Be mindful of copyright & distribution laws. 
    5. All submissions must be sent by February 8th, 2021.

Your submissions will be placed in a folder under your Reddit username on the drive. For multiple submissions of the same thing (ex. Rickroll video) I'll have a list of all the people who wanted to send that on the drive with the video.

If you have any questions let me know here or PM me


**EDIT:**

I can't tell you all how happy I am that so many are enthusiastic about this.

With 2.3k comments, 1.5k messages, and 1.3k chat requests at the time of this edit, it'll take me some time to get back to everyone. If I haven't responded to you yet, I will in time.

So far we're well below the threshold and, everyone who has requested a slot either via comment, message, or chat has one. 

Thank you all for being so patient and participating! Keep the submissions coming, we still have a lot more room to go!

**EDIT 2:**

**As of 7:00pm EST on January 26th there are still tens of thousands of slots available**

* If you have sent a request or submission by the time of this edit via comment, mail, or chat, *there is a slot for you even if you have not gotten a response yet*. We're checking each submission individually to ensure they're within the limitations. 
* I now have 23 amazingly generous people assisting me with compiling the data! Note that if you have sent me something private via mail or chat, it will remain private and I alone will compile it into the drive. 
* The users /u/UndiesMorita, /u/ValphonsHelper, /u/Supa_Mom, /u/hammer3344, /u/LunaTheLark, /u/Eleksploded, /u/GratefulDrifter, /u/JTGrey, u/cotton_corpse, /u/TROL2292 and /u/theblackrosetta will be replying to comments approving submissions. 
* I'm unable to respond to chat requests at this time. I've sent a ticket and hopefully this can get resolved soon. I am receiving your chats and adding them to the drive. Apologies chat users!

Thank you all once again for your contributions!


**EDIT 3:**

**As of 7:00pm EST on January 27th we still have thousands of slots available**

* If you have messaged me before this edit via comment, message, or chat, you have a slot. We're going through the process of approving each post individually and sending confirmation. It will take time to respond to you, but we'll respond to everyone we have approved

* I can respond to 'Messages' but I cannot respond to 'Chats' due to a limitation set by Reddit. If you made a submission via 'Chat' and you do not get a response within a week, you may consider your submission accepted and loaded onto the drive. If I have any issues with your submissions, or if your chat request was a question, I will reach out to you via the 'Message' system.


Thank you all for your patience and contributions! Everyone who made a submission so far within the parameters set will eventually be added on :)

**EDIT 4:**

**As of 9:00pm EST on January 28th we still have thousands of slots available**

* The team of 20+ helpers are methodically going through, approving posts, and loading them onto the drive. In addition to the comments, there are (currently!) 16,000+ Messages that are being checked. If you're accepted we'll let you know - Please give us at least a week to get back to you!

* If you send a 'Chat' request instead of a 'Message', I cannot respond to you due to limitations with Reddit. The best way to receive confirmation your submission has been accepted, or to have a question answered, is either by commenting below or using the 'Message' system. Apologies for the extra hurdle!

As always - THANK YOU all so much for your enthusiasm with the project. It's a ton of work but we're enjoying it immensely!


**EDIT 5:**

**As of 6:00pm EST on January 31st, everyone who has requested a slot, has a slot. We have not run out of room yet!**

* We've been spending the weekend approving, confirming, and loading submissions onto the drive. We've gone through tens of thousands of submissions and have many more to hit - For those who haven't been approved yet, thank you for your patience! 


* If you sent a 'Chat' request and have not gotten a confirmation - We will be sending you a confirmation via a 'Message'. ~~However, we're waiting on approval from Reddit to send these confirmations out as it'll be a few thousand messages and could be interpreted as spam.~~ We've got the greenlight! We'll be responding to the 'Chat' requests that have been backlogged since the 26th over the next couple of days.

Apologies to those who have not heard any word from us - We will reach out to you when we can :)


**EDIT 6:**

**As of 8:00pm EST on February 3rd, everyone who has requested a slot, has a slot. We still have not run out of room yet!**

* We're still in the process of responding to 'Chat' requests per edit 5. Thank you for your patience as we make our way down the list :)

* If you're just seeing this now, feel free to make a submission! We still have a ton of room left - Just make sure it's sent by **February 8th**

Thank you all for your submissions, patience, and enthusiasm with the project!

**EDIT 7:**

**As of 8:00pm EST on February 7th, everyone who made a submission has been considered with a majority being added! More info:**

* The entirety of this thread (13,000+ comments) was copied - Any text posts that were a submission in compliance with our acceptance policy was loaded on. If you haven't gotten a confirmation from us, but your post was within 10MB, SFW, and legal - You can consider it loaded on! We'll still send out confirmations for peace of mind :)


* If your submission contained media of some form we're able to strip most of these off. For other hosting methods such as Google Drive/Dropbox - We've been doing these manually and may not have gotten to yours yet. Please keep media links live for us until the 22nd so we don't miss your submission!


* Submissions close on the 8th, but we'll be spending the next two weeks (until the 22nd) ensuring everything is proper. We might reach out to you if there is an issue. 

As always - Thank you all!


**EDIT 8:**

**Submissions are now closed!**

**If you've made a submission prior to this notice at 1:00pm EST on February 8th, you've made it in time! We'll be spending the next two weeks compiling submissions and sending out confirmations. If you've submitted media links please keep these live for us until the 22nd.** 

**If you have any questions, feel free to message myself or one of my helpers listed above!**


# Final Edit:

All submissions that both followed our submission policies *and* we could access have been loaded onto the drive. In order to prevent anyone from being missed, we scrapped off all comments/messages and their contents and put them into an archive. That archive was also included on the drive. If you're concerned that you were missed - One way or another you're included on the drive!

The night before the space shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986, a three-way teleconference was held between Morton-Thiokol, Incorporated (MTI) in Utah; the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, AL; and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. This teleconference was organized at the last minute to address temperature concerns raised by MTI engineers who had learned that overnight temperatures for January 27 were forecast to drop into the low 20s and potentially upper teens, and they had nearly a decade of data and documentation showing that the shuttle’s O-rings performed increasingly poorly the lower the temperature dropped below 60-70 degrees. The forecast high for January 28 was in the low-to-mid-30s; space shuttle program specifications stated unequivocally that the solid rocket boosters – the two white stereotypical rocket-looking devices on either side of the orbiter itself, and the equipment for which MTI was the sole-source contractor – should never be operated below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Every moment of this teleconference is crucial, but here I’ll focus on one detail in particular. Launch go / no-go votes had to be unanimous (i.e., not just a majority). MTI’s original vote can be summarized thusly: “Based on the presentation our engineers just gave, MTI recommends not launching.” MSFC personnel, however, rejected and pushed back strenuously against this recommendation, and MTI managers caved, going into an offline-caucus to “reevaluate the data.” During this caucus, the MTI general manager, Jerry Mason, told VP of Engineering Robert Lund, “Take off your engineering hat and put on your management hat.” And Lund instantly changed his vote from “no-go” to “go.”

This vote change is incredibly significant. On the MTI side of the teleconference, there were four managers and four engineers present. All eight of these men initially voted against the launch; after MSFC’s pressure, all four engineers were still against launching, and all four managers voted “go,” but they ALSO excluded the engineers from this final vote, because — as Jerry Mason said in front of then-President Reagan’s investigative Rogers Commission in spring 1986 — “We knew they didn’t want to launch. We had listened to their reasons and emotion, but in the end we had to make a management decision.”

A management decision.

Then I opened that in the Google Street View app and can see what Neil saw, like this https://i.imgur.com/dsKmcNk.mp4 . Download the second image and open in it Google Street View and press the compass icon at the top to try it yourself. (Open the panorama in the imgur app to download full res one. To do this instal the imgur app, then copy the link above, then in the imgur app paste the link into the search bar and hit search. Click on image and download.)

Edit: Craig_E_W pointed out that the original photo is Buzz Aldrin, not Neil Armstrong. Neil Armstrong took the photo and is seen in the video of Buzz’s POV.

Edit edit: The black lines on the ground that form a cross/X, with one of the lines bent backwards, is one of the famous tiny cross marks you see a whole bunch of in most moon photos. It’s warped because the unwrap I did unwarped the environment around Buzz but then consequently warped the once straight cross mark.

Edit edit edit: I think that little dot in the upper right corner of the panorama is earth (upper left of the original photo, in the visor reflection.) I didn’t look at it in the video unfortunately.

Edit x4: When the video turns all the way looking left and slightly down, you can see his left arm from his perspective, and the American flag patch on his shoulder. The borders you see while “looking around” are the edges of his helmet, something like what he saw. Further than those edges, who knows.."

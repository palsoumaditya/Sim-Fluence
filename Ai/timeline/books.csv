ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

To reach the call in line directly by phone, **call 202-930-8550**.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say: 
> I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

muule5,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,39076,0.79,2039,2021-04-20 22:14:23,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/muule5/unpopular_opinion_leaving_negative_reviews_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/muule5/unpopular_opinion_leaving_negative_reviews_on/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,,False,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying *""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""* etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as **triggers** in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes. 

If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it. 

Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit. 

What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.

&#x200B;

To quote a classic:

> “But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”

**Edit**: Wow, maybe it is not such an unpopular opinion after all,but certainly a bit controversial. Thank you for the awards.

Also, many of you tried to guess or messaged me asking what trilogy I was referring to. It is The Captive Prince trilogy by C S Pacat."

""Now let's take up the minorities in our civilization, shall we? Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog-lovers, the cat-lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade-journals.""  

""Yes, but what about the firemen, then?"" asked Montag.  

""Ah."" Beatty leaned forward in the faint mist of smoke from his pipe. ""What more easily explained and natural? With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors. That's you, Montag, and that's me."""

I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.

Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.

""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""

And thats when some gears started turning. 

So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.

Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

I had no idea the books were free. I went to the library the very next day and got a card. Then I find out I can rent the books online and have them delivered to my kindle!

This is a complete game changer and I feel so foolish for not realizing this sooner!"

When I'm out with my wife and she's shopping at a seemingly endless stream of clothing stores, I find the nearest bookstore I can -- which isn't always easy -- and lose myself in the stacks. I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing. 

I'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping. 

I love bookstores and will be sad to see them go. I'll miss them when they're gone. But they don't have much time left."

In reality, it's about people getting offended over nothing and demanding the government destroy offensive media but eventually  the people get too sensitive so that the only thing left is meaningless entertainment. The parallels to today make me feel uncomfortable.

Am I misunderstanding or were most people misquoting?

EDIT: I see now, I took a shallow view of what I remembered. Actually going back to it, especially Beatty's monologue, I see both ideas are a part of it but so is people not wanting to bother with complex ideas, and apparently Bradbury hates technology. Maybe one part over sensitivity, one part government involvement, and two parts people wanting instant gratification. I still believe it's mostly the fault of the people

The parents are ruled by a grudge preventing the happiness of their children and causing violence and death in the town they live in because neither wants to forgive the other. Like, their *unnamed* grudge causes fights to break out in the streets, causes deaths of people who have nothing to do with their grudge. You could make the argument that the fact that no one can name what caused this animosity, that it must not have even been so terrible, and they are holding onto it all out of pride.

Romeo is introduced to us by saying how he wants to *kill himself* because his romance with Rosaline ended, then immediately falls in love with the first cute chick he sees that same night, implying that he falls in love easily- that he is more in love with being in love than anything else. This is further exemplified by the fact that, unlike with many of Shakespeare's couples in other plays, we really don't get a chance to see either Romeo and Juliet as individuals with their own personalities other than ""in love"". Romeo, what about Juliet do you love so much other than her appearance? Anything? Wit? Kindness? Determination? What, other than appearance, makes her worthy of your obsession? He never takes the time to praise anything other than her surface qualities.

Romeo allows his obsession to shut down any thought of the potential consequences in eloping with Juliet. This is seen by how cluelessly he responds to Tybalt on encountering him, post marriage. He doesn't even behave rationally, just thinking: Well, I love Juliet and she loves you, therefore we're buds now.

As for Tybalt, his failure is giving in to blind rage, provoking a fight between himself and Romeo, which results in Tybalt's death.

Mercutio is pissed cuz he knew all of this needless fighting and death was based on these two families being made up of absolute drama queens all worked up over some straight-up bullshit and that *none of this had to be this way,* but because Romeo is his himbo friend he goes ahead and gets murked trying to keep his buddy from killing himself. This is why he dies like: ""For the record, you guys' families are toxic af. Bleeehhhhh...""

Finally, if Romeo had given a moment to think about *anything at all* in the crypt (self-reflection, analyzing the damage this family grudge has done to everyone, commentary on the crypt's interior decor) rather than *immediately making decisions based on his powerful emotions* neither Romeo nor Juliet would have died.

Stop teaching Romeo and Juliet as a romance. Especially to teens. Teens are *often* influenced by their emotions into making knee-jerk decisions that they often come to regret or have dangerous consequences. They *need* to hear the allegory as it was intended to be taken.

&#x200B;

Edit: no, I didn't *just* realize this. I am frustrated because as a librarian that works with teens, I have heard this is how it's being taught to them, and when I was in high school I was also taught to interpret it as a sad love story about true love. I am frustrated to hear that it is still being taught this way by at least some teachers.

&#x200B;

Edit edit: I did not add the spoiler tag. No clue why it's there, but meh.

&#x200B;

Edit the 3rd: Some of you guys are thinking I see this as my raison d'etre or that I'm rabidly angry about this, but really it's just an annoyance. I ended up really liking Shakespeare in college but the way Romeo and Juliet was taught to me in high school had left me feeling frustrated and angry and I just assumed it was because I must not like Shakespeare. So I missed out on really enjoying his works for years because I assumed that my frustration was with Shakespeare's work, rather than my teacher's interpretation of it. "

dhgug9,"10 years ago I was the type of person to always have a book in their hand, on their nightstand, in their bag - I was reading upwards of 20+ books a year. Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!",31104,0.9,878,2019-10-14 02:56:51,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dhgug9/10_years_ago_i_was_the_type_of_person_to_always/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/dhgug9/10_years_ago_i_was_the_type_of_person_to_always/,self.books,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share! 

Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them. 

I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page. 

I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying. 

But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book. 

Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around. 

Edit: everyone’s complaining about my one-paragraph-mobile-formatting-brick so I fixed it, hope that helps"

I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.

Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.

Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?

Edit: Thanks for the gold, but if you find yourself in a giving mood think about donating to the National Center for Family Learning or your local literacy programs!"

I used to LOVE reading when I was younger, even in the early years of high school I would sometimes just go to the library and read during lunch. And then I just stopped. 

I always told myself “I’m just too stressed with school”, “oh I’m just in a reading slump I’ll come out of it soon”, but I never got back into reading. I would try and try but as we all know, forcing yourself to read is not going to help. And then the diagnosis of depression came and even then, I still put my lack of reading to being stressed and in a slump. 

It wasn’t until yesterday when I was talking to my sister about how I was getting back in to reading again and I was nearly finished my second book in three days. 

She said “oh you’re turning into me”. 

I wasn’t. She had turned into me, a lover of books and getting lost in the pages. I then realised that it wasn’t a slump. It was my depression that had caused my love for reading to just disappear and I think that is a valuable piece of information I want to share because it has been nearly 5 years since I really sat down and read and read and read, and now that I’m somewhat on the uphill, I’m finding my footing in the reading world again.

Edit: I want to preface that I am not implying that if you have lost your love of reading that you have depression, nor that if you have depression you will lose your love for reading. As a nursing student I know that the signs are different for everyone. I am aware that this is not always a sign of depression for everyone. I just know that if I were back in the darkest spot in my life, seeing a post like this where I can relate to what the OP is saying and feel justified in my feelings, would have positively impacted my journey to where I am. 

We are not all the same in our journeys but we are all the same in our need for justification in the feelings that we may have when in a period of depression. Many people do not feel that what they are experiencing is valid and do not feel like what they are feeling is important. Raising awareness for even the littlest of signs is the least that we can do to push someone to seek the help they need. Justifying their feelings so that they feel that their experience is valid is the most important tool in helping people to get help. 

My goal was to help just one person realise that they are not alone and that losing their love of reading is a valid feeling in the dark times in our life."

I hate being this picky but when I know the original cover art for the book is nice I don't want a film poster on it. I almost don't even want to get the book. I've seen this trend happen with a lot books that turned into movies and frankly I don't care that it's a movie. I'm here for the book!

I know I was being over dramatic here and I still wish with certain books it wasn't so hard or expensive to get their original books ( Im looking at you ""Let The Right One In"" ). But as someone who has always been passionate about writing and reading I can't ignore the fact that movie covers helps the book industry and authors. So for that I'm super grateful! Anyways I just want to say I love you all here and thanks for educating me on the importance of them❤ I also want to say it was so fun seeing all you passionate readers here it warms my little heart."

""Wow"", I though, ""this AMAZING game is based on a book, must be doubly amazing, I must read it!""

Oh no, and so I have. Atlas Shrugged is a **terrible** book. It reads like fanfic. Atlas Shrugged is like ""50 shades of gray"", but for the economy.

It's a long winded love letter to capitalism, with engineers and CEOs being by far the smartest, purest and best beings on our Earth, basically Disney princesses in suits, with doves landing  on their lapels and everything.

Being an inventor or a capitalist basically means you're the world champion of philosophy, limbo and sex.

This goes for women too! Well, A woman who's equal to them in every way, except when she gets horny and requires a good tending to, you know, like a silly woman does. But only by her intellectually and entrepreneurial equal, can't have some schmo with no patents to his name caress your snow-white complexion with his rough inventor hands, looking at you with steely blue eyes.

The grand finale is some guy reading out a manifesto on a radio or something to the entire Earth, everybody sits and listens in silence for hours because that's what 80 pages of it felt like.

Why is Atlas Shrugged so revered?

**Edit:** half of the comments answer it's not revered at all, the other half are calling me an idiot for not understanding its majesty.

It's not a book about economy or capitalism because they don't work even close to what the book describes, the version of capitalism and social dynamics outlined in the book is the ""Saturday morning cartoon"" version at best."

Edit: this is truly amazing. I've said mostly everything I can for now. Alll commenters will receive a signed first edition if these dreams really do come true. I love you all

Edit #2: how the fuck did this happen

Edit #3: I want to take this opportunity to say a few things about borderline. Honestly I really don't like referring to borderline with that particular moniker, because I find it reactionary and overt and misleading. I prefer Emotional Regulation Stndrome because it's nicer and more accurate. I find my condition to be more akin to autism than something like anti social personality disorder or sociopathy/psychopathy, all the things media sources tend to group us capricious messes up with.

ERS people can and often are insufferable  under the right (wrong) conditions, which seem to be rampant in the context of our current social conventions.

 It is wrong to institutionalize us, as you watch us lose all sense and reason, using our reaction to your reaction as the means to dignify grouping us up with damaged strangers in sanitary squalor. You crumble our precarious psyches, which then become pernicious, and then the marginalization of our lives becomes the natural needed course of action for everyone in our lives, our vicinity, our perceived reality.

 It is sad and it needs to stop. Determinism is at play and the means and the end in terms of how you treat us is fucked, we do not want to become this. 200,000 men with BPD/ERS statistically will commit suicide and it breaks my heart because I know what feelings they will use as fuel.

Final update: this post will be referenced as I shop my manuscript around to publishers. Almost a quarter of a million views....still unbelievable. I'm about 70% done with the edits I was given and then....man, who knows.

Thanks for everything Reddit. You made me feel amazing and increased my chances ten fold. I love you all, truly."

It is one of those books that actually makes you think and not the one that thinks for you. The quote “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view. Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.” will always stay with me.

What quote/scene from To Kill A Mockingbird is unforgettable for you?

EDIT: Just to be clear, when I said “60 years ago, Harper Lee was already advocating for Black Lives Matter” I didn’t mean to single-out every person who had been fighting for it since day 1 or that it was Lee who first fought for it. This is my first time to actually get this tons of upvotes here on Reddit and I’m just surprised how some people could easily misinterpret what you genuinely mean. 

On the other hand, I truly appreciate all the recommendations which people said to be better representations of the long fight against systemic racism than TKAM. I’ll definitely check them out.

Lastly, a lot of you were saying that if I loved TKAM that much, don’t even bother reading “Go Set A Watchman” because it’ll definitely ruin the former for me and the characters I’ve learned to love. Well, if I’m being honest here, that makes me want to read it even more. I guess I will have to see it for myself in order to fully grasp and understand where people are coming from. Also, people were saying the latter was a product of exploitation and actually the first draft of TKAM which publishers rejected hence I shouldn’t really see it as a sequel. But I beg to differ, why can’t we just see it as a study of how the novel we know and love that is TKAM came to be and how Harper Lee’s idea evolved and changed instead of seeing it as a separate novel?"

Or that nightmarish quality when you're reading in pitch-black off your phone in bed, and your limbs can't be anywhere near the sides. Or you have to go to the bathroom, but can't reach two feet to your lamp because you know something is gonna grab you.

My most memorable book as such would have to be *Misery* by Stephen King. Even with the lights on I finished it with a thickening terror which didn't want me turning off the lights.

What's a book (or anything) that had a similar effect on you?

Edit: You guys are killing it! Keep it up!

Edit 2: Shit guys 10k+? God bless you goddamned bookworms!

Edit 3: Guys can you tell me if I made the front page yet? Cause I promised my mom I would make the front page in 2017. Without cats.

Edit 4: Feliz Navidad you goddamned saints.

A recent realisation is that I have read my last ever book in the usual sense. It's quite sad when I think about it given how much I love reading and even have a library in my house. What makes it worse was the last book I read was rubbish, I didn't really enjoy it at all but read it as I don't like leaving books half started. It was 'How Not to Die Alone' by Richard Roper. Had I have known I might have re-read an old favourite or tried a random new genre. I've never tried audiobooks, and I know there is a debate as to if it constitutes reading, but for me it's going to have to be the way forwards."

I was expecting it to be interesting - I'm blown away.",27242,0.93,1666,2022-08-11 19:12:27,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wlrpr6/currently_reading_jennette_mccurdys_memoir_im/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wlrpr6/currently_reading_jennette_mccurdys_memoir_im/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"There's been a lot of hype for this book, so I was expecting a more-so-than-normal interesting celebrity memoir, but what I'm reading goes so far and beyond what I expected. The subject matter itself has been talked about to death by now in the news cycle and on Reddit so I won't go into that too much - you know what you're getting into here. Instead, I wanna talk about the rest of what her book is about.

Jennette has a distinct writing voice and we learn quickly that she always wanted to be a writer since it was the one part of her life she had any control over, to the point where she wrote whole screenplays just for herself which she shared with her mother (the titular, *ahem*, well... you all know at this point).

This book has completely changed my perspective not only on iCarly (I don't know if I could honestly ever watch it again and be able to enjoy it in the same way after this), but child stardom in Hollywood in general. The abuse she went through as a child went far beyond whatever you're expecting to the point where you will probably be shocked by how underdeveloped and naive she was even at the age of 18. There are genuinely moments where I wanted to put the book down because it got so uncomfortable to read but it was so engrossing and affective, so *honest* that I burnt through half the book in just a few hours.

I know it's sold out in so many places already, but I highly, highly recommend any 90s/00s Nickelodeon fans to pick this one up (or download the Ebook) if you can. She's also working on a novel right now and I can say with confidence as I read this that I'll be checking it out.

Also just want to add that I have an incredible respect for Miranda Cosgrove now, more than I would've expected, and the chapters dealing with their initial friendship are particularly interesting when you juxtapose them with their characters from iCarly - almost a role-reversal in the real world."

I loved it again, fantastic movie.  As good as when I was a child. My wife wanted to get the full experience with the book, so she bought a copy on the ol' Amazon.

It shows up. She starts reading it and realizes, ""damn, this is a long intro of some random dude."" I pick up the book, look at the author and I'm like, ""sweetie, who is this author? The author from the movie is S Morgenstein. Who is this William Goldman? Some dude trying to profit on some classic.""

This William Goldman's guy is on the front of the book, but the book I know - the book mentioned in the movie - the author is S Morgenstein. Like, what the hell is this William Goldman think he's doing putting his name on it?

It gets worse. After an intro that is like a sixth of the book by this rando, he starts interjecting in the middle of the book. Or worse yet REMOVING parts of the book and then letting us know he cut some of the story out so we wouldn't have to worry about it. Oh my gawd. The nerve on this guy.

I'm thinking, ""This idiot must have bought the rights from the estate of Morgenstein and then brutalized the book without consequence and republished it. This is the worst.""

So my wife sends the book back and buys another copy.

IT'S THE EXACT FUCKING SAME THING!!!

Surely there are some actual original publications out there right?! Without all this extra crap!!! SO we can have the ORIGINAL experience!!!

I literally pull open reddit to write this very tirade expressing my frustration and I think, ""Hold up. Who is this William Goldman?""

Turns out... it was originally written this way.

So yeah. I'm an idiot.

Edit: Well shit, it's spelled ""Morgenstern."" Ty for the solidarity those who have fallen for sneaky Goldman also. We stand in our united in our gullibility."

rsyjml,Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago,27104,0.91,1711,2021-12-31 22:44:45,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rsyjml/sir_terry_pratchett_was_making_fun_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/rsyjml/sir_terry_pratchett_was_making_fun_of_the/,self.books,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"So I'm reading *Discworld* for the first time (yes I know, quite late to the party on this), enjoying it so far, but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor. I thought I'd share it here because it shows that this kind of thing has been prevalent in fantasy (and to be fair, many other kinds of) literature for a long time now.

From *The Light Fantastic* (I don't think this counts as a spoiler since it doesn't give away any of the plot, mods please let me know if I'm wrong):

> ...this particular hero was a heroine. A redheaded one.

> Now, there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one's shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at length about leather, thighboots and naked blades.

> Words like ""full,"" ""round"" and even ""pert"" creep into the narrative, until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down.

> Which is all rather silly, because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword isn't about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer.

And then Pratchett does communicate that this character is attractive, but he does so almost grudgingly, as though it's some kind of concession to the reader:

> Oh well, all right. The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling's Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chainmail, soft boots and a short sword.

> All right, maybe the boots were leather. But not black.

This book was published in 1986, so this was an interesting (and funny) glimpse into the fact that the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy (which still persists today) has been around for a long time."

Very rarely can I actually get immersed in a book, oftentimes I feel like Ron Burgundy who spoils humorous moments by bluntly remarking 'we are laughing!' - but in the context of reading I'm sitting there scanning the words thinking 'wow would you look at me reading Dostoevsky. Quite the learned individual aren't I.' and I sometimes go into a fuckin weird inner monologue that ends with a David Mitchel rant 'words don't really exist do they, they're just a collection of squiggly lines that someone gave meaning to...look at how stupid that one looks'.

It sounds a bit amusing but it's really fuckin frustrating.

Then there's the ambience of the room and external distractions, the discomfort of holding the book open, my itchy ass, not wanting to crease the spine of the book too much blah blah... I'm just disappointed with myself for struggling so much to read. I went years without much reading, and I was expecting some challenge upon returning to it, but not to this level.

Has anyone had similar experiences?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** 

Well It appears that I'm not alone in this issue... I'm not too sure if this should come as a relief or not...

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** 

For the record I wasn't trying to be a pretentious bastard with my writing. If it came across that way it's because I actually went on a crusade to learn every word in the English language over half a decade or so  - I've forgotten most of them but occasionally an obscure word will slip into my writing because it's actually the first word that sprung to mind, not because I was looking up rare synonyms on [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) to prove how intelofgent I am.  

I have had a bit of fun calling girls pulchritudinous and watching them got offended before discovering the meaning of it, but overall it's been a waste of time and all it's really done is get me mislabelled as being a pompous prick when I'm not trying to be. "

It should be a must read in school and shows key economic problems (e.g. economic inequality, affordable education etc). and facist tatics which should be dealt with to maintain healthy democracies and identify extremist politicians.

Edit: Wow this blew up more than i expected! Through the discussion i had so far I have to admit that reading only a book from one point of view is in some way political indoctrination if the book is not sufficiently cricitally analyzed and discussed in class which is difficult as teachers may not be completely umbiased. Thus a book covering opposing views should be covered aswell to provide a full overview. However, all in all i believe reading these books are better at giving an understanding of these forms of governance  than just plain theory, films or fictional books.

Thansk for the great discussions so far!"

However, I finally got to read Brave New World last week. And man, it is actually the true order of the world. This post is not argue which book is better. It's just an appreciation of Huxley's world-building. As per me, we're being controlled yes, but without 1984's upfront and ruthless hate. 

 I'll let this quote by Neil Postman sum it up: 

""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.

In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""

I always loved books but found reading through the same page 4-5 times daunting. With this font paired with the dark mode option, I’ve even read an entire 345 book in one day! 

Dyslexia prevented me from fully absorbing the material. Now I’m whisked away to whichever world I choose. I never thought I’d ever be able to enjoy reading as I do now. I’m incredibly grateful.

**EDIT: Sorry guys, it gets really busy at 6 am! 

I am aware that audiobooks exist. I listen to people talk all day. I can’t listen to two people at once. I’ve tried them and I don’t enjoy them. 

There are absolutely studies that show the font DOES NOT help you to read faster, more accurately, or even help at all. This is NOT a remedy for dyslexia.

I’m NOT advertising the font as a cure all. Just stating that with MY Dyslexia it helps ME feel more comfortable. I misread words, skip over entire paragraphs, lose my place frequently, flip letters that look similar, mirror simple words, all the good stuff. I can read and read and read the same page and still feel like I don’t understand. 

Theres also more than one form of dyslexia. What makes me feel comfortable might not be comfortable for others. Is it a placebo? Probably! Is a placebo that’s made me more confident while reading? Absolutely. And I’m stil happy with that. 

What helps ME to feel more comfortable while reading is the spacing. 

“Venice &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cats.” 
“Venice is a city of cats.”

Thicker bottoms and lines on the letters/longer  “tails” help me a little bit with flipping and keeping my place. I feel like don’t fixate as long as a did after I grew comfortable with the font. My font size is pretty large as well. I’m a die hard Helvetica fan but I’ve grown to like this more while reading long passages. 

As for my spelling thank duck for autocorrect 🦆 **"

Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .

History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.

My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .

There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .

And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .

So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”"

When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.
But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions"". In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.

This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.

edit: Woke up in the middle of the night to my dog jumping on my bed and licking his crotch and saw this post blowing up. Glad to see it resonates with so many beyond myself. I would also like to plug Infinite Jest and DFW's work in general, one of the reasons I found Neil Postman. Infinite Jest is about a Huxley-an dystopian future where advertisers buy the rights to name years, therapy tries to get you to release your inner infant, and a wheelchair-bound group of assassins tries to destabilize the world by disseminating a video that is so entertaining you desire nothing else in life but to watch it. A little verbose(lol) but imo worth every word."

They mention that they ""read"" the book, and there are a *lot* of upvoted comments telling OP that OP didn't ""read"" the book, they listened to it. Some of these commenters are more respectful than others, but all of them have this idiotic, elitist attitude about what it means to ""read"" a book. Why do you care? Someone is sharing the joy they experience while reading a book. Isn't that what this sub is all about? Get over yourselves.

There are also quite a few upvoted comments telling op that if WWZ is one of the best books they've read, then they need to read more books. There's no nuance here, these commenters are just being straight up rude.

Stop gatekeeping ""reading"" or whatever. Someone referring to listening to an audiobook as ""reading"" does not harm you in anyway.

EDIT: I am getting a lot of comments about about the definition of reading. The semantic point doesn't matter. As one commenter pointed out, an audio reader and a visual reader can hold a conversation about the same book and not realize they read in different formats. That's really all that matters. Also, when I see these comments, they usually include or imply some kind of value-judgment, so they aren't just comments on semantics."

This is a adults who read YA need to remember who YA is for post. 

I've been floating around the arc (advanced reader copy) circuit for a while. Read some good stuff, read some bad, read some meh. This past weekend I had the privilege of reading one of the best books I've had the privilege of reading in a long time. YA fantasy that was beautifully written and equal parts dark, funny and suspenseful. The teenaged characters acted authentically like teenagers, which unfortunately is incredibly rare in YA. 

Edit: For those who are interested, the book is Remnants of Atonement by G.P McKenna. It doesn't release until October, so likely only available through netgalley, but if you have an account and enjoy ya fantasy, I highly recommend requesting it. 

Today I logged on to leave my feedback and thought I would nosey around in the reviews, only for my heart to sink. Everybody seemed to agree the plot was good and the writing was fantastic, but so many people were complaining that the characters acted too much like teenagers. One reviewer even praised the plot but only gave it one star because ""it was too obvious that the characters were 15/16 years old and that annoyed me.""

Again, these are YA books. They are intended for teenaged readers. If you enjoy reading them too, that's great, but understand that. If you find teenagers annoying, go read literally anything else. You have the rest of the book store, the rest of the library. Don't complain that the 16 year old character acts too much like a 16 year old because what happens then is -because as adults we have the money - the market will continue to push YA characters who are 35 year old accountants stuck in the body of a 17 year old assassin. The list of books teenagers can relate to goes down, isolating them from their own catagory. 

Long story short, let teenagers read teenaged characters who act like teenagers. Stop isolating real life teenagers by appropriating the ya catagory when you have every other book to choose from if you don't like the teenaged voice. Support young readers by letting ya characters be kids!"

Too many relationship counselors offering their services for free tonight when their generosity is not actually needed. 
—————————————————————————————

So, I’m going to gripe about it here. 

First off, who is this book even for? It reads like it’s written for middle schoolers, but everything revolves around 80’s references that they wouldn’t understand. I feel like I’m too old to for the book yet I’m a 90’s kid (born late 80’s). 

Second, let me talk more about the terrible writing. Nothing is implied in this book and the reader discovers nothing. Aunt and aunt’s boyfriend = bad people 🙁Wade = super clever and righteous 😊 Samantha = sassy and smart 😉 and Sorrento = EVIL! The characters have no nuances whatsoever. The only interesting character development was Aech actually being a chubby black girl, but from I hear about Ready Player Two (more on that later), it just doesn’t go anywhere. Overall, it reads like a book for 13-year-olds, but I just don’t feel like it was intended to be directed at 13-year-olds...?

Third, the “love” story between Wade and Samantha is cheesy, forced, and kind of misogynistic. Like, I thought that he’d realize that he doesn’t actually love her, he’s just crushing really hard. Maybe she’d help him understand that by saying how they haven’t even met and he doesn’t actually know her. To be fair, she tried a little bit, but her main argument was, “you don’t love me because you don’t know that I’m actually ugly!” What the fuck? The author can tell me that Wade loves her for who she really is and doesn’t care about her looks, but everything always ends up coming back around to her looks anyway. And she falls for him in the end! Why? This relationship makes no goddamn sense. It especially makes no sense because even though she’s way better at the Hunt than he is (sans playing playing a few classic arcade games), Wade still somehow becomes her white knight in shining armor. It’s gross and I hate it, and I’m a dude. Also, I can’t even begin to process how ridiculous a lot of the plot points are, like IOI not being able to beat 4 kids with their team of scholars. Wade even discovers how much info they have on Halliday, and not one person on their team, who have more information than Wade, could figure out the stuff he did?

I’m here to rant and say what I can’t to my friend so I’ll be done now, but I’ll make one comment on Ready Player Two. I just got it from the library, read the prologue and immediately returned it after spending a minute reading about Wade eating fruit.

Edit: Did the kid even give one solitary fuck that his home was blown up and his family murdered? I mean, he almost got killed as well."

How badly could it affect your bottom line to use plastic stickers that come off clean?

I found 6 of the Chronicles of Narnia books at a bookstore once and got the missing one from Abe Books a few years ago and it came with a sticker on the spine, making the set not really a set. I contacted their customer service just to say, ""Hey, not sure if anyone has said this but the janky stickers kind of harm the product."" They gave me a refund but I didn't want a refund, I just wanted the title of Prince Caspian to be visible when it's on the damn shelf!

Booksellers at Barnes & Noble are really suffering right now. Other than the usual frustrations of being booksellers in the year 2021 we have also been the subject of constant abuse from customers. All we’re asking is please be patient with us. Here are somethings t be aware of and please spread the word:
1) if we could have every book ever made in stores we would. We’re not Amazon, we can’t have dozens of every small press title ready to go and in your hand in two days. 
2) Shipping delays have affected us too. We want your order to come ASAP but we don’t control the shipping lines or the warehouses and we’re not given any real means of tracking your order either. 
3) we’re short short staffed. Like everywhere else. We’re paid minimum wage and people are going anywhere else quoting after two weeks and they can’t even hold onto managers. We’re doing our best but a lot of us are new and still getting used to the job and we don’t have a lot of backup for when we get busy. Please have patience with us.

So many of us have been reduced to absolute tears the past few weeks from customers yelling at us. Throwing books around and just the stress of each person trying to the job of three or more. We love books and love bringing those joys to people but we definitely need help and support during these trying times.

EDIT: thank you everyone for your massive outpouring of support. It’s incredibly heartening. This account was made from a group of us just wanting to get our experiences out there and it quickly changed the mood of our night. We hope that perhaps some word of this makes it to someone with the power to make a difference."

How do you deal with that?

They also say the same about lectures though. They say that as soon as you walk away from a lecture, you already forgot 95% of the material covered in it.

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""

This is just me though, that’s how I felt about it but i’m sure many students out there probably feel the same. Let me tell you, read those books. I’m currently a college senior, and only recently started reading for leisure. The emotions that these books evoke while i’m reading is truly amazing, to the point where I find myself lying the book on my chest and relishing the messages that just pop out of the page. Books are a tool used to deepen ourselves and change the way we see the world around us, the authors of the past have so many great insights that I wish I appreciated earlier in my academic and personal life. Just do yourself a favor and read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, Sinclair, etc.

EDIT: Hey guys, after reading many of your comments, I realized I may have come off a bit strong in pushing what’s assigned to us in school. However, that wasn’t truly my intention. What I more or less meant to say is you should give the assigned readings a chance, because we may often overlook some good pieces of literature. With that, “try to read your Faulkner, Twain, Huxley, and Sinclair.” Also, I have nothing wrong with spark-notes, I shouldn’t have made that title. Spark-notes is a wonderful resource that definitely helps us better understand some really difficult reading material, but it should be a supplement and if you’re really really not enjoying the book, just spark-note the dang thing!"

Five children are forced to engage in guerilla warfare, espionage and repeated murder to protect their loved ones from alien parasites as they wait for the other, heroic aliens to finally arrive.



 When they do, the “good” aliens turn out to not give a shit about humans, caused the whole intergalactic war through their own shittiness and are willing to exterminate whole planets themselves to get at their hated enemies.


A child repeatedly experiences his intestines hanging out of his body while in various animal forms


A child is mentally tortured until broken and never gets better

A child in the form of a fly experiences getting splattered and smeared against a ceiling until his friends who are also flies at the time can peel his body off and take him somewhere he can transform back into a whole human before his insect mind fades completely


A child is shrunken and experiences having her eyeballs digested out of her head inside her friend’s stomach while she’s in the form of a tiny elephant


The heroes are forced to permanently imprison another child in the body of a rat because he knows too much and they abandon him on a tiny island with only other rats and garbage for company.


 Rumors circulate that the island is haunted but it’s actually his psychic screams reaching distant boaters.


A race of devastatingly powerful, violent aliens turn out to be mental toddlers who don’t know what they’re doing and are just bred to think they’re playing one big game before they’re killed at age three so they don’t learn the truth


An alien spends a few centuries hanging from the parasitic tentacle of a much bigger alien, surrounded by millions of rotting corpses attached to its other moon-spanning tendrils. They engage in mental warfare until one finally absorbs the other completely.



It turns out another seemingly “evil” alien race is simply driven to kill and eat everything in sight because it was separated from its original world where food was continuous and the entire specie’s life is the torture of perpetual starvation


A peaceful robot willingly removes its inhibition against violence to help in the war, only to slaughter a huge number of alien-controlled humans so gruesomely that nobody dares think about or speak of it again and it is the only thing left undescribed in a book series that already describes entrails getting torn out and skulls getting smashed


A child stays too long in the form of a flea and instead of turning back into a human, accidentally turns momentarily into one big, giant flea that can only writhe and moan because it shouldn’t exist and can’t live at that scale.


The kids discover Atlantis, then discover that Atlanteans are inbred mutants who paralyze any humans they find, dissect them alive to figure out how their organs work, then stuff the corpses as kitschy museum displays for their children.


An ordinary ant gets transformed into a human child. It has no idea what’s happening and is so overwhelmed by its huge new brain and sensory input that it can only scream until it dies

I don’t know why it hit me. I’ve seen that kind of motivational shit spread around all the time, but just the simple way such a harsh truth was worded so succinctly and the way it related to that point of the story really made me think.

1984 is great at illustrating the warning behind government totalitarianism. The characters live in a world where the government monitors everything you do.

Brave New World is a similar warning from the stand point of a Technocratic Utopian control

F451 is explores a world about how ignorance is rampant and causes the decline of education to the point where the government begins to regulate reading.

-offering discounted entry to local museums/attractions

-holding educational/arts events for kids/teens/adults

-holding (free) small concerts for local musicians

-lending books between themselves to offer a greater catalogue to residents

-endless magazine and newspaper subscriptions

-free tutoring spaces (provide your own tutor)

-notary services

-access to the internet for those without, along with printing

-career services resources/ test guides

I have no problem with knowing the year the specific edition I was reading was published and in many cases that could provide helpful context. But they display the date the edition was published in a prominent place and in a way that leads you to believe it is the original publication date. 

I feel like there could be a pretty simple fix to this and save a lot of headaches, at least on my end. Idk am I crazy in letting this bother me as much as it does?

I got back into reading just a couple of months ago and I read a lot of fantasy in English (currently reading mistborn). A few days ago, I was interested in seeing if there are any fantasy classics from the Netherlands. So I looked up online, to see if there is some kind of ""Dutch Tolkien"". I couldn't find a lot, so I went and asked my Dutch Literature teacher if there is a fantasy genre in Dutch literature and if she knows of a ""Dutch Tolkien"". She told me bluntly that I shouldn't read fantasy and that she doesn't consider it to be ""real literature"". She basically thinks that Tolkien's books aren't ""real literature"".

That teacher is one of the biggest gatekeepers I know. She keeps rambling about how sad it is that kids don't read much anymore and then she literally claims that certain genres shouldn't be read. She's also one of those people who say that listening to audiobooks doesn't count as reading.

Well I'm just gonna keep reading my ""not real literature"" and my teacher can continue being an ignorant gatekeeper.

Edit: I wrote this post during my lunchbreak so I didn't have any time to respond to the comments since I was in class all this time. I'm going to discuss many of the points you guys brought up here with my teacher and I hope that I can convince her to perhaps change her views regarding fantasy.

I also didn't expect so many comments so my post isn't as nuanced as it probably should be. I wrote it right after asking her and this post became more of a rant than I intended. I don't actually think that the teacher is an idiot, but she is unfortunately very close minded.

*Keep in mind that she teaches Dutch literature in high school. I see many comments of people in the Netherlands or Belgium who have had the same experience with Dutch literature teachers, so this might be some form of Dutch snobbery or maybe it just has to do with the fact that the fantasy genre is very uncommon in literature here, so she thinks that it's only for kids. Either way, I would've expected her to be less of a gatekeeper and more of a teacher.*

To clarify about audiobooks: in Dutch schools you are required to choose a list 12 Dutch classic novels that you have to read in your 3 years of high school (if you do vwo). My teacher doesn't allow us to listen to any of these books on our list in audiobook format, because ""it's not reading"".

Another edit: wow this blew up and got way more upvotes and comments than I expected. Also thanks for all the great (Dutch fantasy) book recommendations. Apparently these kind of posts get posted very often, so I'm sorry for accidentaly making such a generic post while ranting about my Dutch teacher lol. "

And I'm too excited; like, I want to suggest this book TO EVERYONE! Damn! 

Crichton originally wrote this book in 1969. And the most wonderful aspect of this book (apart from the brilliant story) is its scientific accuracy. Being in the 6th semester, we've come across almost all the topics discussed in TAS— Microbiology, Biochemistry, Enzymology, Biophysics, Immunology...and it is correct in its assessment everytime.

Another beauty is Crichton's ability to blend in fact and fiction in such a way that it would seem as if it is actually happening, in real time. At moments I held my breath for as long as 20-25 seconds.

If anybody is keenly interested in biological sciences, this is a book for them. It'll make you 'scared-to-death' (spoiler?).

Happy reading!

EDIT: Maybe, even more fascinating than getting 3 awards (THANK YOU!) is to go through the comments section, where redittors from all across the world and of all generations are sharing their experiences with the book (even now, a notification pops up even other minute). 

Some have loved it, and I couldn't have agreed more to this; some have pointed out flaws, which I think are truly disappointing. 

Many others have shared stories from life, how this book taught them something, or how they read this repetitively, or how they've liked and/or disliked his other works, and it is very enjoying and encouraging to get such responses. Thank you for contributing to this conversation!"

HOWEVER, I am a Chinese girl with a Chinese name - I grew up in England, and my sister and I were the only Chinese kids at our school. Cho Chang was the first Chinese character I encountered whilst reading. I felt seen. Her name, and even the fact that she was the only Chinese girl (that I knew of) at Hogwarts, resonated with me. I also think this reflects the time in which JK Rowling wrote the books: there just wasn’t as many Chinese people in the country as there are now. 

I don’t think the problem is Cho Chang - I think it’s that I haven’t come across another relatable character (ethnicity-wise) whilst reading.

On Sunday evening I was looking through books available on my daughter's Kindle for her to download and read at her leisure when I say that ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was available for free.  I grabbed it quick and hoped that she would begin reading it soon.  Then the thought occurred to me, why not read it to her?  I haven't read a book to my daughter in years.  I read the first chapter and she was enthralled.  Having read the series myself years ago I knew what was going to happen and reading it aloud I am able to put the right inflections into the parts as they are needed.  And to say she's enjoying it is not even close.

Since that night I have read a single chapter to her each evening, sometimes staying up past her bedtime to ensure she gets the prerequisite chapter finished.  When we get to the end of the chapter she is begging for more.

As a parent I know that in the future when she is much older and has kids of her own she will think back to this time in her life fondly.  It warms my heart to know that I am making a memory that will last her lifetime and it is even more special because I know it now.


Edit:  Wow, Front Page and Gold!  Thank you all for enjoying this post.  And thank you kind stranger for the gold!   I am just glad to get to share this moment in my family’s history with you. 

Edit 2:  there have been a lot of replies about Sorcerer’s Stone and Philosopher’s Stone. In the US it was released as The Sorcerer’s Stone. Prior to today I had heard of The Philosopher’s Stone and it appears both are correct depending on region where it was released. "

**Notes:**

\- They've only released 8 lists thus far, starting in 2014 and ending in 2020, with one year having two ""official"" list releases. I put this data together months ago, so I'm a bit hazy on the reason, but one of those two lists seemed to make far more sense to me at the time as the true list, so I just chose that one and disregarded the alternate list.

\- I hope the intro is understandable, but in case it's confusing: If a book appeared in at least 5 of 7 yearly lists, it is not penalized/lowered in rank for not appearing in the other 1 or 2. But books with 4 or less appearances are always ranked lower than books that appeared more often, even if they ranked higher on average. The number 5 may seem arbitrary, but I had to have some system to avoid outliers and that made the most sense to me.

\- The genres and page counts are shoddy. I wanted that aspect of the list to be simple so I just had one figure for each, and of course you can find a ton of different figures online. The page counts are primarily B&N, and the genres are primarily Wikipedia.

**Observations:**

\- Books by American authors appear more than twice as often as any other nationality, with 29 occurrences. Then, English with 14, Russian with 11, French with 9, and Irish with 7. 61 books are from Europe, 4 from South America, and 2 from Asia (excluding the Bible, and Russian literature since it is usually grouped separately). Nearly half of the Russian novels appear in the top 20, though - their five novels in the top 20 fall just short of the 6 American novels in the top 20.

\- 4chan validates its reputation somewhat, as the list only features three female authors, one being JK Rowling. Notable authors like Jane Austen and Mary Shelley are absent. Virginia Woolf does have two submissions though.

\- 18 authors have multiple appearances. The most appearances made by any author is a three way tie between Dostoevsky, Joyce, and Pynchon with 4. Faulkner has 3. Fourteen authors have 2.

\- By far the most popular century is the 20th century with 60 occurrences. The next highest (19th) has under 20. The oldest book is the bible (considering the old testament), and the newest is Jerusalem, by Alan Moore (2016). There are 5 books from BC.

\- The average submission (including series) is 570 pages. The lowest page counts belong to Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* with 102, and *Hamlet* with 104. and the most are the Harry Potter series with 4,224, and Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, with 4,215.

(Prime price is 20 bucks) What a deal! I thought, and soon after I ordered, I got that feeling of dread you get when you think that something may be too good to be true. I immediately canceled my order and looked at the seller profile. It was all caps with a name ""JAMESHALEY"" I believe, and their profile was just recently created. Their items for sale included pretty much the entirety of best sellers on Amazon. 

I did a quick google for JAMESHALEY and found a blog post detailing the scam. Scammers will open up new selling accounts, listing almost every book imaginable at an unbeatable price, knowing that due to Amazon's 1-click purchase feature, they will get a lot of hits. Of course the shoppers will cancel their order, but more than likely they will already have your Name, Address, & Phone #, which is what the scam sets out to accomplish. 

I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident and reported the seller. They sent me a swift response and even credited $5 for my trouble. So today I am browsing for books again and lo and behold, a different seller name has a great price, same situation. This is happening all over the site in different categories with more and more accounts being created everyday. So when shopping for a deal on a good book, please check the seller profile before you click ""buy""!"

A lawyer was speaking to a character explaining a charge and said: 

“Murder in the second, which is the most serious charge for murder that is premeditated but not involving a police officer.” 

And it completely took me out of the situation because I immediately went no that’s not how that works. 2nd is typically NOT premeditated which is its main distinguishing factor from 1st. The involvement of a police officer does not have any bearing on it at all. Unless I’m severely mistaken, but I don’t think I am.

Has this happened to any of you where you’ve seen something obviously wrong and it just kills the mood for you?

EDIT: apparently in NY where this book is set saves 1st degree murder for really specific circumstances and then labels all other premeditated murder as 2nd so I was mistaken. I googled second degree murder premeditation before posting to confirm what I thought and all the links I got told me I was right and that premeditation made the charge first degree. I did not think to try googling NY 2nd degree, because I didn’t realize there would be a difference. I guess I suffered from confirmation bias on this one. Thanks to you guys who picked up on it!

EDIT 2: Yes I was wrong. Yes that makes this post an irony. But I won’t delete it. It’s interesting seeing the discussions you’re all having and at the end of the day it’s better to just admit I was wrong then try and hide it.

EDIT 3: I never thought this many ppl would see this post. The egg on my face is thoroughly cooked and my tummy is full of crow. A lot of you have been kind about my error and some of you have not. You reading this are allowed to be wrong. You’re allowed to not know everything. You just need to own up to it when you’re called on it and learn from it. Even if that mistake might be seen by a crap ton of ppl on the internet. My apologies to Adam Mitzner."

The Book has such warmth, such love for family, and Jack's struggle. Danny is a complex character, as is Wendy.  None of the actual scary spooky monster stuff happens until near the end...and that's brilliant. 

I know this book was near and dear to King due to his own drinking problems.  I also know authors sometimes tend to get a little heated about adaptions and it's overblown sometimes. Not in this case.

Kubrics movie, while an enjoyable watch, has lost all flavor to me after reading the book. It's liked someone ready a summary and bullet point presentation, but missed the entire point.

I finally decided to read it after watching Doctor Sleep and loving it.  Decided to read them both. I know Kings books are often pretty different than their TV or Movie Adaptions, but this one...wow.  It feels so shallow now. Jack in the movie feels crazy from the start, ready to murder his own family at the drop of a hat.

In the book, his struggle is so heartwrenching.  His desire to be a better man. To resist the hotel. Seeing him ultimately lose in the end, knowing it was coming because of the movie and Dr.Sleep of course, I still was like ""Please don't do it Jack, resist!"", I couldn't help myself.

It really touched me on an emotional level, Jacks internal monologues.  I don't drink or have kids, but it resonated with me so strongly, the feeling put into those.

Instead Kubrick made it a generic horror movie."

If you would like to follow me/follow each other on Goodreads, Just PM your profile link and I'll add you :) Although you should know I dont review books on there, I simply use it to track the books I'm reading/want to read but I will gladly follow along to your reviews!**


[Here's a link to every book I've read, feel free to ask me about any book in this list if you're on the fence about it.](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE) PS: the link works best in browser, not thru a mobile app! 

**Science Fiction**: 

*The Three Body Problem trilogy, Cixin Liu* -- This trilogy is always getting thrown out whenever asks for a good ""alien"" or ""first contact"" book, for good reason. I dont think any other book(s) goes such in depth when it comes to character development and global politics than these. The books span from the cultural revolution in China, to many centuries in the future. 

*Dune, Frank Herbert* -- I dont think I've ever read a sci-fi book so beautifully written. From the dialogue between the characters to everything else. This book was one of those books you enjoy to actually read more for the writing style than the story itself (not that the story was bad, it wasn't) similar to the book Lolita. I loved this book and wish it was longer. 

*Extracted Trilogy, RR Haywood* -- This is a time travel trilogy where everything is very easy to follow. Its not one of those mindfuck reads where you have to do extensive mental gymnastics to keep up with the plot. You will immediately fall in love with the characters and their collective humor.

**Fiction**:

*The Goldfinch, Donna Tartt* -- I enjoyed this book more for the characters than the story itself. Boris to this day is still one of my all-time favorite book characters of all time. I dont think this book is as good as Tartt's other novel ""Secret History"", but I enjoyed this one more. The movie is set to come out next month as well!

*The Great Alone, Kristin Hannah* -- This book takes place in the late 70s and is about an abusive Vietnam vet and his family and their quest to ""start fresh"" in Alaska. This is a relatively new book, having been published last year but out of all of the novels I've read, this was one of my favorites. Good character depth and a long timeline of events that dont feel rushed or glossed over. 

*The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles, Haruki Murakami* -- This is by far my favorite Murakami book. There's a part in the book where a general is telling a war-time story, those that have already read the book know what I'm talking about. Its one of the best parts of the book and a story within a story that has stuck with me since reading it. If you haven't read Murakami yet, this is a good place to start. 

**Non-Fiction**:

*Missoula, Jon Krakauer* -- You probably know Krakauer from Into Thin Air (worth the hype), but in this book he tackles rape, rape allegations and the legal process of rape within Universities, specifically Missoula. This book was very eye opening to me because it delves deeper into victims and their experiences. Before this book, all I knew was what was said on television about rape trials, basically he said she said, and the trials' verdicts. Reading this made me much more sympathetic to victims/accusers. Given the current #MeToo movement and the empowerment of victims to come forward, I think if there's one book you take away from this post, it's this one. 

*Tribe, Sebastian Junger* -- This author is the mastermind behind the famous documentary ""Restrepo"" that followed Army soldiers in the dangerous Afghan Korengal valley. In this book he focuses a lot more on returning soldiers, PTSD and how to better understand combat and non-combat veterans. This is a very short read (45mins - 1hr) but you come away with such a better understanding of veterans and their difficulty of readjusting to civilian life.

*Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11, Mitchell Zuckoff* -- This book on 9/11 focuses less on the actual terrorist actions, and what led to those actions, and more on actual people impacted by 9/11. I have to warn you though, this book is extremely heart-breaking. You learn a lot about victims and their final days, their final actions and final moments of life. It's a gut-wrenching read that gives you a whole new intimate understanding of the suffering that went on that day and the days, weeks and years that followed. I've never cried while reading a book but this book was as close as I ever got to doing so. 

*No Place To Hide, Glenn Greenwald* -- Greenwald is the journalist who broke the Snowden/NSA mass surveillance story in 2013. This book covers the events of before, during and after his Snowden meeting in Hong Kong. He also goes into depth of some of the NSA spying tools, how they work and who they target. Its a very digestable book and you dont need to be a computer whiz to understand the programs he lays out. Greenwald is one of my favorite journalists and this book further cemented that for me. 

*The Anatomy of Terror, Ali Soufan* -- Soufan is a former counter-terrorism FBI agent who in this book details exactly how radical Islamists think, operate and specifically on the rise of the islamic state in the Middle East after the US invaded Iraq. He also goes deep into the sectarian wars between terror groups themselves (Sunnis vs Shias etc). This book gave me a better understanding of how from nothing in 2009, IS rose to power.

**Science**:

*A Crack In Creation, Jennifer Doudna* -- If you've heard of the gene editing method ""CRISPR"" and the many many medical benefits it can have for humanity, it is because of Jennifer Doudna, the scientist who in 2013 discovered that CRISPR Cas-9 has the ability to edit DNA. This book was really fascinating and very easy to read. You dont need to have an interest in biology or genetic engineering to enjoy the book. This book led me down the DNA subject rabbit hole and I wound up reading books on Paleontology, ancient human DNA from Neanderthals and Denisovans, to evolution and ancient life. If you want to learn more about the benefits of gene editing, this is the book to read. 

*The Hidden Reality, Brian Greene* -- Greene is a world-renowned physicist most notably known for String Theory. This book is a layman's introduction into String Theory and the multi-universe theory. Again, you dont need to have an interest in physics to enjoy the book. I have never even taken a physics class before reading this book and deeply enjoyed it. If you like watching youtube videos by PBS Space Time, you'll enjoy this book. Greene does a good job in laying out all the information in a way anyone can understand it. 

*Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari* -- If you've read Sapiens by this author where he focuses on who we are and how we got here and enjoyed it, then you'll enoy this book that focuses on who we're becoming and where we're going. A bunch of broad subjects are discussed in this book and you'll walk away having digested a bunch of information. He's a historian so we wont dive too deeply into a subject but you'll instead get a broad picture of it. 

**History**:

*The Road To Jonestown, Jeff Guinn* -- Before I read this book, I always thought of the Jonestown event as a mass suicide by a bunch of religious cultists following a crazy ass religious/socialist zealot. I remember watching YouTube videos on the event as well and forming my opinion on it from them. But there's just so much more to it. It gives you perspectives from former members, how they were either brainwashed or coerced to remain in the 'Peoples Temple'. How the vast majority of the residents of Jonestown were actually lied to and fooled to going to Guyana to how those that did not commit suicide were either shot or forcibly injected cyanide. A very powerful book with insight on how cults operate.

*The Billion Dollar Spy, David E. Hoffman* -- This book follows Adolf Tolkachev, a soviet engineer turned CIA spy during the cold war. For years he fed military secrets to his handler, secrets that saved the US over a billion dollars earning him his nickname and the title of this book. I had never heard of this man until reading this book but I'm glad I did. The man had massive balls and risked everything to do anything he could to topple the soviet union. 

*House To House, SSG. David Bellavia* -- Of all the war related books I've read, this is the most gripping and exhilarating one yet. Its a memoir written by Staff Sergeant David Bellavia that takes place during the height of the Iraqi insurgency in Fallujah. If you read this book, you immediately think ""bullshit, this doesnt even happen in movies, this is obviously fake"" because of how crazy the events in the book are. But they're not only 100% true, but were all captured on film thanks to journalist Michael Ware. It was just a few weeks ago too that the author was awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military honor in the US, for the actions he took which he laid out in this memoir of his. Great read. 

*Man's Search For Meaning, Viktor Frankl* -- Frankl is a psychiatrist who was sent to a concentration camp by the nazis during WW2. He observed and noted the behavior of his fellow prisoners and saw how despite the horrid conditions they lived in, they continued to find meaning in their lives. This book is very powerful and it is also a short read given the book is 2 parts. You can make do with only reading the first part, the second part he does a deeper dive into psychology and logo-therapy. Many people on this sub have recommended this book and its with good merit. This is a powerful book. 


**Books that live up to the hype**:

*Harry Potter Series, JK Rowling* -- Dont ask me why I like these books. Im a 24 year old dude who could not turn away for one second after picking up these books. I owe an apology to all those kids I mentally judged as a kid because they were really into HP. I thought the allure of these books would be lost on me because of my age but that wasnt the case. If you havent read them yet, you should at least give them a chance. 

*A Song Of Ice And Fire, George RR Martin* -- I am very glad that I decided to read these books before starting to watch the HBO series. I loved these books and although it was challenging, for me at least, to get into Martin's writing style where he goes back and forth between characters, it became easier as I read on and started to catch on to the plot and I grew to like the style. I've expressed to my family how much I like this series so I'm looking forward to getting Winds of Winter for my 40th birthday. 

*Anything by Kurt Vonnegut* -- I've read about half a dozen of Vonnegut's books and havent been let down by any of them. They're a treasure trove of quotes and analogies. There are those who are contrarians and say he's overrated because of how much hype he gets but dont be turned away by them. He's a good author who deserves 100% of the admiration he gets.

*The Kite Runner & A Thousand Splendid Suns, Khaled Hosseini* -- I read both of these books my senior year in high school and decided to re-read them because I thoroughly enjoyed them back then. They were just as good as I remembered them. Hosseini gets recommended a lot on this sub for tear-jerking books and rightfully so. His books take place or have root in Afghanistan given hes an Afghan native himself and he gives good insight on what it is like coming up as an Afghan youth. Great author.

*Dark Matter, Blake Crouch* -- You probably already read this book for the off chance you havent, you should. Its recommended here religiously for good reason. You get sucked in from page one and the story is very easy to follow. His new book ""Recursion"" is also worth a look if you read Dark Matter and enjoyed it.

**Overall favorite book**:

*East of Eden, John Steinbeck* -- Out of the 250 books I read, I have not enjoyed one more than I have East of Eden. This was a very easy choice to make, about one third into the book I knew I was reading something special. The characters, Steinbeck's way of writing, the story-line, everything. There's a very good chance that no book will ever dethrone this one as my favorite and that makes me a little sad. Nonetheless, I am very glad that I read it. Its a beautiful book that I look forward to re-reading. 


I should clarify that the above list is just my very humble opinion. I have a certain taste in writing and information that the previous authors knew how to struck. I've included a screenshot to all 250 books I've read at the top of this post, [and here as well](https://imgur.com/a/sOwySVE). Feel free to ask me about any single one of them, I remember them perfectly and will to respond to everyone :)"

I reward myself for a hard day of work by coming home and browsing the little rectangle while the big rectangle plays in the background, and perhaps using the medium rectangle to inject dopamine points into my eyeballs with video games for an hour or so.

My parents were for whatever reason a little slow to allow me my first smartphone (I had a flip phone until about 2012). I was a quiet, well behaved, and very obviously outwardly depressed student, so most of my teachers would let me either sleep (during periods 1, 2, and either 4 or 5 depending on which one was immediately after lunch) or read in the back of class (during periods 3, 4, and 6) because I was doing well on all my tests anyway. 

(I also just want to take a second to say fuck high school schedules. I was and am a natural 3-11 sleeper like a lot of high schoolers were, and having to get up at 6:30 to go to learning jail should be against the Geneva Convention)

Reading used to be my escape, man! I remember when Inheritance came out and I was so stoked for it and I finished it in like 3 days. It was so immersive and I would often maladaptively daydream that I was in the book doing something awesome.

What happened? Now I can't go more than 5 minutes without my hand instinctively reaching for the Reddit or Facebook button. I know because I uninstalled them, and so my reflex would happen and I would find myself staring at a blank page wondering what I even got out my phone to do.

I've had Way of Kings on my Kindle (probably one of the better rectangles, if I had to choose) for like, 2 years now, and have only made it through 400 pages, all of which are..... walking.... and talking...

Anybody else feel like this?"

It was my first time reading it, also. He loves all things to do with knights, castles, and dragons so I knew it would be a big hit.

Over the course of two months, for roughly 30 minutes a night before bedtime, I acted out, as best as possible, the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and Company. I immensely enjoyed voice acting the various characters and could slip into Hobbit, Dwarf, Elf, Smaug, and, most enjoyably, Gollum at a whim. 

We finished last night and today I overheard my son singing the Misty Mountain song (I got several requests to repeat that part and I was able to sing it well thanks to YouTube). That experience brought us closer together and it warms my heart to know how much he appreciated our Hobbit time each night.

An unexpected journey, indeed!"

tq8spe,"Ender's Game seems like the poster child for 'support the art not the artist'. I don't understand how an outspoken homophobe wrote this amazing book that champions the power of empathy, but thank goodness for libraries and used book stores so we can still read and enjoy this wonderful book.",18847,0.83,2427,2022-03-28 18:31:28,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tq8spe/enders_game_seems_like_the_poster_child_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/tq8spe/enders_game_seems_like_the_poster_child_for/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"Orson Scott Card is an outspoken homophobe who donates to anti-gay causes, so its a pretty natural response to not want to support him financially. Here are a couple quotes from him on the issue:

>""Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down.""  
>  
>""The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.""

So, gross is a bit of an understatement. That said, Ender's Game has an incredibly important message that it would truly be a shame to lose. Thank goodness we're fans of a medium which has options for consuming the art without financially supporting the artist.

If you haven't read the book, here's the setup (no spoilers IMO, back of the book kind of thing, but I'll still put it in black in case you prefer to go in with a blank slate). >!It's the story of Ender Wiggin, a boy who is recruited into the elite orbital Battle School. There, young men and women are trained into the next generation of military leaders to command the forces of humanity against the buggers. The buggers are insect-like aliens who have attempted to invade the solar system twice, nearly wiping out humanity in the most recent invasion, and now humanity is preparing for the next battle.!<

>!Ender is a brilliant, empathetic kid, but has felt mostly alone his entire life. His older brother Peter is a violent sociopath, and only Ender’s older sister Valentine prevented Peter from attacking Ender. Now, at battle school, Ender feels even more alone, surrounded by children older than himself and adults who are constantly pushing him to his limits and trying to force him to be violent in an attempt to either break him or mold him into the best military commander Earth has ever produced.!<

This book is so many wonderful things at once.

First, the core theme of the book is the power of empathy and how, even if you're only goal is to 'succeed' in life, you still should strive to put yourself in other people's shoes. Sure, you need intelligence and drive, but if you truly understand other people and how they think and feel, you'll both be the kind of person other people want to be around and able to understand other people's motivations and values. I don't know about in the rest of the world, but in America we have far too little popular art that highlights the power and importance of empathy - and by showing how empathy is invaluable even to people who only want to 'succeed', I think Card has made a truly unique argument for a habitually undervalued virtue that speaks perfectly to the people who most need to hear it.

The book is also just an unbelievable page turner. It's the classic hero's journey - and Ender is a hero that you absolutely will want to root for. How can you not be on the side of the brilliant, sensitive six year old kid who is taken from his family and put through hell to try and save the whole human race? It's also got one of the best twists of all time, which in addition to blowing your mind on the first read, also brings home subthemes about the importance of communication to avoid conflict, and a general anti-war message as well.

For lots of other kinds of art, its very hard to consume that art without financially supporting the artist. Thank goodness that we have libraries and used book stores, which make it possible to read wonderful books by problematic authors without sending money to that problematic author.

He has made no formal update in 8 months.",18816,0.94,2796,2022-08-01 23:53:19,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wdoiq2/in_december_readers_donated_over_700000_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/wdoiq2/in_december_readers_donated_over_700000_to/,self.books,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"Just another update that the chapter has yet to be released and Patrick Rothfuss has not posted a blog mentioning it since December. This is just to bring awareness to the situation, please please be respectful when commenting.

For those interested in the full background:

* Each year Rothfuss does a fundraiser through his charity
* Last year he initially set the stretch goal to read the Prologue
* This goal was demolished and he added a second stretch goal to read another chapter
* This second goal was again demolished and he attempted to backtrack on the promise demanding there be a third stretch goal that was essentially ""all or nothing"" (specifically saying, ""I never said when I would release the chapter"")
* After significant backlash his community manager spoke to him and he apologized and clarified the chapter would be released regardless
* He then added a third stretch goal to have a 'super star' team of voice actors narrate the chapter he was planning to release
* This goal was also met and the final amount raised was roughly $1.25 million
* He proceeded to read the prologue shortly after the end of the fundraiser
* He stated in December we would receive the new chapter by ""February at the latest""
* There has been zero official communication on the chapter since then

Some additional clarifications:

* While Patrick Rothfuss does own the charity the money is not held by them and goes directly to (I believe) Heifer International. This is not to say that Rothfuss does not directly benefit from the fundraiser being a success (namely through the fact that he pays himself nearly $100,000 for renting out ~~his home~~ a building he purchased as the charity's HQ aside from any publicity, sponsorships, etc. that he receives). But Rothfuss is by no means pocketing $1.3M and running.
* I believe that Rothfuss has made a few comments through other channels (eg: during his Twitch streams) ""confirming"" that the chapter is delayed but I honestly have only seen those in articles/reddit posts found by googling for updates on my own
* Regarding the prologue, all three books are extremely similar so he read roughly roughly 1-2 paragraphs of new text
* Rothfuss has used Book 3 as an incentive for several years at this point, one example of a previous incentive goal was to stream him writing a chapter (it was essentially a stream of him just typing on his computer, we could not see the screen/did not get any information)

Edit: Late here but for posterity one clarification is that the building rented as Worldbuilder's HQ is not Rothfuss' personal home but instead a separate building that he (""Elodin Holdings LLC"") purchased. The actual figure is about $80,000.

Edit 2: Clarifying/simplifying some of the bullet points."

I love seeing dragons and magic and struggles between good and evil. It's all amazing to me. But when some people get their panties in a twist about forced diversity because one background character is darker than others it just makes me think that you're too indoctrinated by this political climate we live in to enjoy the actual story. There's a fucking dragon getting slayed but you are pissed there's an Asian wizard in the background in the climatic fight scene? That doesn't sound like an actual grevience. Sounds like a personal problem.

I'll take it a step further. I don't care if main characters are diverse. If it's a fictional world not based on any real people I say go nuts. People say it's pandering but litterally it's all pandering. White dudes get pandered too so much they don't even notice it like a fish in water. Let me have a bad ass Asian dude on a quest to unite the four kingdoms with a bad ass party full of knights and wizards. I don't care as long as the story is good but someone being a different skin color in a fantasy setting that's not based on actual things that happened doesn't and shouldn't bother anyone.

Edit: Quick notes because I got pretty overwhelmed with the response.

* when I say Asian I mean people of Asian decent in the story. Not litterally from Asia in a fictional universe. Like you'd describe Asian coded people in your world like how the shu are described in 6 of crows. Not put Asian products africa in your fantasy world.

* I don't mean only Asian or black people. It's every miniority underrepresented people in fantasy. Gay, Indian, trans, Hispanic etc etc.

* saying ""but what if they changed black Panther white isn't a gotcha. It's a really cliché disengenous argument..

* Diversity doesn't ever need justification. Ever. I shouldn't ever have to justify my existence. Especially when you never try to justify the existence of white people.

* representation is important. Just because you don't personally see the value of it doesn't mean it isn't valuable.

* yes I have read more than one fantasy book. The fact that people would attack me and gatekeep because I haven't read your favorite series is messed up. I'm just as real of a fan as you.

* me making this post isn't forcing diversity down your throat.

* saying I don't want diversity I just want good stories is just telling on yourself. Firstly, wanting both is perfectly okay. Secondly, they aren't mutually exclusive.

* no, ""just imagining the characters as whatever you want"" isn't an answer. If the character is clearly described as a white dude, and is casted as a white dude in the movies, me imagining he looks like me does nothing to fix the issues we're talking about.

* asking why people still care about skin color ignores how many people can't choose to ignore their skin color. In America people are still treated differently and have very different lived experiences because of their skin color. Stop saying that like it's a obvious answer it's not and it's off topic.

* no wanting more diversity isn't racist.

* I truly don't care about karma. It can't buy me anything. I never understood reddits obsession with karma. I didn't realize there's an unwritten rule about not crossposting after a certain date. So if that bothered you I'm sorry. I updated the post with the bulleted thoughts because the intention wasn't to do that. 

Look man all I wanted to do here was vent about how I wanted to see more diverse fantasy but yall one one. No one should be called racist because they care about representation."

It's amazing how they have changed with the times! 

My library has three media rooms, a 3D printer (plus classes to take on how to use it), a video production library full of equipment you can check out, a teen game room, yoga classes, small business classes and more. I was really amazed at how much of a central community hub it had become compared to my old public library which was still a bit older and dated. 

You can even check out a kindle while you go on vacation! You can preload books to read and take it with you. Simply return once you get home. Now I live on the road and constantly travel. I use their online catalog to rent ebooks onto my kindle. I literally have a library with me wherever I go! 

I can't overstate how much I love my library! 

Edit: I also wanted to add for those who don't have a kindle, you can download the kindle app to your phone or computer for free! That's what I did before I was gifted my current kindle :)

Double edit: Since some people are curious, my main library is Library21c in Colorado Springs, CO.

Last Edit I promise: User r/Fartin_Van_Buren pointed out to me that the Colorado Library System is set up to receive donations from smile.amazon.com. Just search under ""Pikes Peak Library District"". "

The protagonist is Harry's son, James Potter, starting at his first year at Hogwarts. The characters are a good mix of characters you know and their descendants, and totally new characters. The conflicts are much more multidimensional, with a lot more moral ambiguity and complexity, without straying from the plucky adventurous tone HP fans will love. The books also delve more fully into the theory and origin of magic, the international wizarding community, the history of magic, and the founding of Hogwarts. The writing style is evocative of JK Rowling without attempting to copy it, with a good mix of humorousness, classes, and childhood antics to complement the main conflicts.

It's available as an audiobook/podcast by chapter for free, and there are free PDFs of all the books easy to find on Google. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have!

EDIT: As some people have pointed out, turns out there are actually FIVE books! Even better!
EDIT: To be clear, JK Rowling gave the author permission to distribute the books for free, but did NOT endorse the series as canon."

At the beginning of this year my mom passed away too (she never really recovered from the loss of my father), I’m sad that I never had the chance to offer her one copy of the book, but today is a big achievement in my life and I wanted to tell my story here and share it with you, because a lot of my motivation and energy came from all the reddit community, so thank you everyone here for being such an awesome community.

EDIT: WOW! You guys are all amazing! Thank you so much for the support! Thank you for your kind words! Thank you for the platinum, gold and silver!! 

A lot of you asked where you can buy it, for the moment.. nowhere I made some copies by myself! Next step is to find a way to publish it and propose it in store :)

I’m french so the book is in French so if anyone here speak/read French, I will be honored to find a way to send you a copy when I’ll have more available! 

Many of you asked for the synopsis, it’s a novel, the story of a boy who lost his father in an accident, and few years later her mom died because of sadness of her loss (yes. It looks like my own life I swear to god that it’s incredibly weird but 100% true) and the book is about the life of this boy and how he will fall in love with books, books will save and maybe destroy him at the same time. 

I’ll try to answer to everyone, thank you so much again for your kindness and support!

EDIT 2: I saw some people talking about sales strategy... I swear it’s 100% true. 
And I want to say something: everyone here who wants a copy will have one for free (maybe digital one because I don’t have a lot of copies..) I don’t want to earn money from this, your support and kindness already help me so much, you can’t even imagine"
vy6jeu,Has Stephen King always put weirdly sexual things into his books or did I just stumble onto two that happened to have it?,18464,0.8,5352,2022-07-13 21:23:33,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vy6jeu/has_stephen_king_always_put_weirdly_sexual_things/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/vy6jeu/has_stephen_king_always_put_weirdly_sexual_things/,self.books,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"*SPOILER* I read Billy Summers a couple months ago and really liked the parental, father/daughter vibe I THOUGHT I was getting from the relationship of the two main characters, until the young woman (19/20) ends up falling in love with the 45 year old (!!!) man. 

And now I am halfway through Firestarter which I believe is a new release and once again there is a grown man, developing a weird romantic relationship with an 8 year old! 

Such a shame because I really enjoyed both books up until he introduced this point. In both books it literally adds nothing to the plot, the storyline would have been literally unchanged if he kept it non-romantic/sexual. I was planning on reading more of his books but after these two I am probably going to give up.

Edit: did not expect this to blow up! From the sounds of it this is a recurring theme throughout his books so I will be taking him off my future reads. 

Also my mistake, someone pointed out that Firestarter is not new; the copy that I bought had a newer cover and I had never heard of it before so I assumed it was a new release.

Edit2: some of you are really upset over the fact that I don’t enjoy reading about childrens sexual activity/descriptions of peoples genitals/whatever other weird stuff King includes….are you guys ok?? 

And also big shoutout to the person who felt the need to message me privately that I must be a new reader since I didn’t know Firestarter was released in 1980. Hope you find something more productive to do with the rest of your day."

Its actually GOOD!

&#x200B;

(Personal Bias) Its in the format I like.  I prefer blog post summaries to extended scientific debates.  I enjoy short stories over novels.    Its easier to make a small decent quality meal vs a four course entree which ends up boring you. I can put this down and go to something else rather easily. This book is not a 4 hour course at a specialty cruise.  It's a row of specialty snacks...loosely arranged in the order it wants you to partake in them. You have quite a bit of personal choice in how you want to read this.

&#x200B;

The short stories are engaging and have a nice personal touch to them.    The wide variety of individuals with different jobs, backgrounds, and personalities have actually reminded me of the book ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.

&#x200B;

The best stories are, of course, about the people not involved with the military(At least, during the initial spreading outbreak).  Zombie stories are best done like survivalist stories. That way you can make the behavior of the people actually believable and gripping!  Quite a few of the military stories involve absolutely idiotic behavior and planning.  Mindless zombies with no strategy have no real hope of taking on an organized military...so the only way to make them win is to give the commanders severe mental deficits.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Once you forget about the above...the stories are well written!    Humans turn into cannibals.  Humans bring their gamecubes they cannot play to remind them of home life perks.   People get saved.  I ""liked"" the story of the Martin Shkreli pharma guy who made the fake zombie vaccine and raked in millions.  People gradually turn into metaphorical monsters in order to fend off material monsters. A trope, but one which at least makes sense. Oh, and the ""individual outpost"" military stories are actually also well done.

&#x200B;

Oh, and it has its cheery moments too! People reminding others to stay alive and upbeat.  People going back risking themselves to save others.  After the ""victory"" life seems to go back to normal...albeit a vastly reduced population and quite different architectural standards to ward off zombies. I would love to see a drawup of the new ""anti-zombie"" architecture ubiquitous in every city.

&#x200B;

One of the few 5/5 fictional books I have read in quite awhile! If you didn't know in advance that the Zombie genre simply has never done the ""military vs initial outbreak"" successfully you may rank it lower.  Instead, you simply have to take that as a given. Engage your suspension of disbelief for some key common and necessary tropes and this \*actually\* ends up fairly realistic.

&#x200B;

Here is a nice quote.

&#x200B;

""In the beginning everyone was friendly. We cooperated. We traded or even bought what we needed from other families. Money was still worth something. Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon. Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they’d always leave me with a neighbor. I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night. It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded. We’d listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from. I’d sit on Dad’s lap. “See,” he’d say, “they didn’t get out in time. They weren’t smart like us.” He’d try to force a smile. For a little while, I thought he was right. But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean. There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing. The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore. A couple times I stepped in human shit. Nobody was even bothering to bury it."""

Clarke had been corresponding with Lewis and they had much disagreement over science, religion and the value of space travel (Clarke was then chairman of the British Interplanetary Society). They decided to meet up, each bringing a friend along, for a face to face. Clarke brought fellow BIS member Val Cleaver and Lewis brought Tolkien.

From Odyssey: The Biography of Arthur C Clarke by Neil McAleer -

'Needless to say, neither side converted the other, and we refused to abandon our diabolical schemes of interplanetary conquest. But a fine time was had by all, and when, some hours later, we emerged a little unsteadily from the Eastgate, Dr. Lewis' parting words were ""I'm sure you're very wicked people - but how dull it would be if everyone was good"" '"

Toward the end I was sure that there is a second book, because I thought there is no way they wrap it up in 50 pages, so it gave me a mind blown moment. Coming back to the game, to Peter, to his traumas and it all build up so perfectly toward the entire story, it's one of the most complete books I've read.

This book has ruined my standards and I know future books going to let me down now in comparison to this one."

gz26ts,"I'm a 23 year old, straight man who has recently fallen in love with contemporary romance novels and I think that it is important for other men to try them as well. Here's why.",17562,0.79,1248,2020-06-08 21:39:21,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gz26ts/im_a_23_year_old_straight_man_who_has_recently/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gz26ts/im_a_23_year_old_straight_man_who_has_recently/,self.books,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I didn't know quite where else to discuss this, but I needed to get off this my chest and felt this would be a supportive community. In recent months, I have felt increasingly down and depressed due to being closeted indoors, as many of us did due to COVID-19. Days melded together and genuine human connection had become next to impossible as everything went virtual. For an introvert, like myself, I was able to cope with isolation better than most, but I still craved something deep and emotional that I could not easily achieve. This led me down the path to try my first romance novel, specifically a book called ***The Kiss Quotient***, and I fell in love nearly instantly.

Like many men, I have been taught by society that we should generally suppress significant displays of emotion and let actions speak louder than words. This can be seen in nearly every form of media/entertainment focused on male audiences from books, movies, and TV all the way to advertisements.  I would always find myself overwhelmed by the overly masculine protagonists that kicked ass and who's entire character development never centered around their growth with another individual in a romantic nature. Romantic partners were often seen as a plus to have, but never a key component to the growth of the protagonist. For this reason, when a romance took place and offered itself as a core part of the characters growth, it felt refreshing and always made me feel much better as a result (there are so few examples that I can't even think of one off the top of my head even now). Eventually, I realized that there was, in fact, a genre that offered this satisfaction, but not as a side note, as the main purpose of the story: romance.

Similar to the stigma that men should hide their emotions, I always felt that there was this unsaid truth that romance novels just weren't for men and those who read them often did so privately out of the desire to not be ridiculed or look unmasculine. Similarly, romance novels, at least these days, are thought to simply be erotica which older women can read in public (looking at you ***50 Shades***). These misconceptions has prevented me from trying them for many years as a result, something that I now feel was a missed opportunity for many more years of pleasure reading.

The book that changed this, as mentioned above, was ***The Kiss Quotient*** by Helen Hoang. This is a story of an autistic woman who hires a male escort to teach her how to be a more romantic person and be more skilled at sex. Naturally, as the story progresses, they learn more about each other and fall in love, despite their difference in social class, wealth, and family trauma. What I loved about the story was not the world, which often led me to other genre's like fantasy, but the characters. While many books focused on male audiences often offer huge casts of characters which have minimal change over the story, this book and many of it's peers had a small cast which gave the writer a chance to highlight their growth on a personal level in greater depth in less time than in huge series such as ***Harry Potter***, where Harry has very little growth in 7 large books (don't get be wrong, I love the series, but I'd hazard a guess that like many others it was due to the interesting world and huge cast of colorful, albeit flat, characters).

I have since devoured several other contemporary romance novels, each time enjoying the emotional character depth present for the two leads. However, the ever present stigmas have prevented me, until now, from really discussing the novels with other people, which as many of you know is half the fun of reading anything. This isolation has made me feel the need to write this post. I feel that there are many others out there that, similar to me, really want something that can provide some emotional based story telling and I believe that romance novels can provide just this.

Now don't get me wrong, these novels do suffer from similar problems in representation regarding men that other genres have towards women. For example, while many TV shows, movies, and books show women as physical goddess that can have the emotional complexity of a hunk of wood, romance novels often depict men as physical machines that have muscles so hard  you could shatter concrete against them while also being gods at sex. This can be very disheartening for male readers, as they can have an inferiority complex and can give the impression that this demigod form is needed to find the emotional happiness depicted in the stories. However, I believe that this provides men a chance to understand and sympathize with the way many women feel about how they are represented in nearly everything else! The solution to improve this stigma in romance novels is the same one needed to fix how women are depicted: more male writers. This in turn can only be done if romance gains a higher male readership who would demand more accurate representation.

In conclusion, I feel that more male readers should give romantic novels a try. It's my firm belief that similar to me, many would actually find a new medium that can proved emotional satisfaction that is so often left out in other genres despite the fact that romance is something nearly everyone will experience at some point in their life. Further more, it has opened my eyes wider to the pressure that women feel in from other media to accept the idea that your physique is core to your happiness, and understand how degrading it can be.

Thank you to everyone that read this entire ramble. I have been needing to get this off my chest for some time and I hope that this gave you some food for thought.

**EDIT:** I really want to thank everyone for all their support and recommendations! It really has meant a lot to see. I have been trying to comment on as many things as I've had time to and I will continue to do so, but please excuse me if I don't get the chance to read what you have to say :(. Also thank your for my first ever gold reward!

**EDIT 2:** At the request of some, I've written a *TLDR*

**TLDR**; Men should try romance novels in spite of social stigma's against displaying emotion as they offer highly satisfying character growth, but also provide a means to experience the inferiority women feel in other genres which can yield much needed shift towards true character representation in all forms of media.

**EDIT 3:** I really want to thank everyone again for their support and suggestions! I just wanted to comment on something that many people have been recommending to me, which is to try watching romance anime and manga. I love romance anime and manga! One reason that I discovered my love of romance in general started when I watch the anime movie **Your Name**. However, as I pointed out to one user, the thing that pushed me towards American romance novels was a significant lack of physical intimacy that is present in Japanese story telling. This is a result of the differences in culture and simply comes with the territory, but as a result, few stories have intimacy present prior to the final chapters or episodes. Also since it was a key topic in my essay, I should also mention that many Japanese anime and manga don't really help with the issues of normal physique in regards to women and can often have some very sexist caricatures of women that I honestly have been getting tired of. That being said, I do appreciate the recommendations and am loving the discussions that are taking place in the comments section!"

I'm guessing I bought it at the library book sale based on the cover and the blurb on the back. I hadn't read anything from this author. From the moment I started the book, it was awful, like a high schooler's first attempt at a novel.

I kept reading until I reached this paragraph: ""Maybe he hadn't gone too far. Maybe he wasn't in deep doodoo. Who knows, he might even get to screw her"" on page 8. I closed the book and can't wait to re-donate it back to the library - at least they'll make another dollar if it sells again.

Anyway, the point is I always see posts about people who want to know how far in a book they should read before giving up. My advice: when you're not enjoying it. That's when you stop. Life is just too damn short to read a book that you're not enjoying (unless, of course, it's for a school assignment).

This is Anne’s son Christopher and it breaks my heart to bring you this sad news. Earlier tonight, Anne passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke. She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died. The immensity of our family’s grief cannot be overstated. As my mother, her support for me was unconditional — she taught me to embrace my dreams, reject conformity and challenge the dark voices of fear and self-doubt. As a writer, she taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions. In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage, awash in memories of a life that took us from the fog laced hills of the San Francisco Bay Area to the magical streets of New Orleans to the twinkling vistas of Southern California. As she kissed Anne goodbye, her younger sister Karen said, ""What a ride you took us on, kid."" I think we can all agree. Let us take comfort in the shared hope that Anne is now experiencing firsthand the glorious answers to many great spiritual and cosmic questions, the quest for which defined her life and career.  Throughout much of her final years, your contributions to this page brought her much joy, along with a profound sense of friendship and community. Anne will be interred in our family's mausoleum at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans in a private ceremony. Next year, a celebration of her life will take place in New Orleans. This event will be open to the public and will invite the participation of her friends, readers and fans who brought her such joy and inspiration throughout her life."""

Turns out it was a very, very detailed story of a child abduction victim getting too old for her abductor and is forced to find someone to replace her. Very heavy on the sexual abuse and very scarring for my 15 year old mind."

Edit: alright everyone, I didn’t expect this much of a response. I’ve taken photos of every page (41) and I’m going to post it a little later. I’m going to answer some of the questions that I’ve been seeing a lot.

-He’s been keeping the list since he was a sophomore in college

-No he doesn’t have a favorite, he laughed and said there’s no way to pick

-he’s read a total of 2,891 (approx)

-The numbers next to the title is the amount read for that year, I think the max he read in a year was 71

-he’s reread about 10% of the list

-He was an editor at a newspaper

Edit 2: Ok, so here is every page of the list: https://imgur.com/gallery/pIpRZDk 

Edit 3: So there seems to be a lot of interest in a digital list. I'm going to work on getting this compiled into a spreadsheet and I'll work on some visualizations of the data as well. Keep a lookout over the next week or so.

Edit 4: If anyone wants to help me digitize the list, DM me. I'd be very grateful.

It's a book related to discarding excess of material things from life and thus living a life that is more clear and fulfilling, which in my opinion is Minimalism. I recently took up Minimalism and so I wanted to check this book out. I heard a lot about this book in the last few months.

But by the time I was half way through it, it got so annoying that I just couldn't take it anymore.

There are actually two reasons why I quit this book:

1. The book starts by author telling (rather insisting) that hers is the *only way* to follow minimalism. (I tend to have trouble with anything that says their way is the only way to do something.)

2. The tone of the narrator was so annoying, she always had that overreaching self-centered pride in almost every single sentence.

Combine these both and it was a real irritating experience to listen to this book. So, I told myself: *fuck it,* and scrapped the folder from my phone.

Did any of you ever had this sort of experience with an audiobook before?

**EDIT:** I really hope and pray that the audiobook producers and voice actors out there come across our discussion here so that they get a greater awareness on our concerns, and work towards providing better quality audiobooks for us all.  Peace!"

This is probably a reason why I've usually preferred more visual mediums like video games, tv shows and movies. 

For me, reading books tends to be a continuation of one of those mediums, rather than the launching point of interest. For instance, I'm currently reading the Witcher series after playing the games and seeing the Netflix show.


So for those with the ability to visualize, does it just happen as you quickly as you read? Or does it happen more after the fact as you recall characters and events? 


Is this why people seem to get so upset because they don't like the look of actors that have been cast in certain roles? I've always felt its far more important to get the tone of the character than their appearance."

C.S. Lewis""

The stages of liking, outgrowing, and returning to fairy tales is a comment that resonated with how I've been reading of late. I have been revisiting the books that I read back in school, those that I grew up with. I realise that perhaps I could not have enjoyed these even a few years earlier, and yet, having reached a certain age (how wonderfully Lewis leaves that open-ended), I'm realising that despite what is often said, these are, in fact, stories that I can return to, no matter how much my age may supposedly separate me from the maturity that these books express. Of course, part of returning is a way of feeding nostalgia, but I have also been feeling that these books still have things to give. They have not been exhausted."

It seemed so boring to me and I was constantly getting distracted. I'd read a whole page but wouldn't understand anything I've read, and thought I hated reading. It turns out that I never hated it, I just wasn't reading the right books. 

Some time last week, I saw a post on the front page from this subreddit talking about the book, ""When Breath Becomes Air"", and how it was the first story that made someone cry in 15 years. I didn't believe you could actually be touched by books; the stories I was forced to read in school never made me feel that way and I assumed all books were the same.

Before I even clicked on the post, I checked it out at the library to see what it was all about, and I finished it in two days. I was bawling my eyes out by the end of the book and since then I've been hooked.

I found out I loved reading on my own, at my own pace, peacefully in my room. Sitting in an overcrowded classroom full of kids who didn't want to be there, reading 20 pages a day, and having to stop in the middle of a chapter just to answer questions about the character is the reason why kids think they hate reading. And it doesn't help at all that teachers pick the slowest readers to read the longest paragraphs in the book. 

I looked up must-read books on Google and this subreddit came up, giving me a whole list of books that people recommended. I went to the library on Sunday and picked up 4 more books that were on the list. Today I finished reading The Alchemist, and tomorrow I will read Brave New World. 

I never thought I'd ever enjoy reading on my own time, but now I can see why people love books so much. Thank you guys for recommending and discussing great books, and for reading my post! Have a great day! "

I have seriously started just skipping names that are gibberish. I applaud your intention to put us in a fresh new world where everything is foreign, I get what the purpose is, but we as readers still appreciate names that we can remember and be certain we are pronouncing right. 

Shoutout to Pierce Brown and his character names and terms in the Red Rising books. Easy to remember, pronounce and unique (Gorydamn, goodman, pulseFist, Ephraim ti Horn, Lysander au Lune, Valii-Rath etc.)

Edit: Some people seem to be misunderstanding my post. There are difficult to pronounce names. It’s a fact. My point, however, is that if you are an author and want your work to become more than fan fiction, using names that are hard to remember and pronounce goes against your goal. Is it acceptable for you that people don’t remember the names of the places and people you spent hours, days, or weeks fleshing out? It shouldn’t. Would you feel better if your readers saw the ridiculous names, and then made their own versions of those names, because your names are so outlandish, that the readers refuse to play along? For a passing sense of foreignness? 

Luke Skywalker. Jon Snow. Harry Potter. These people became cool because of their deeds, despite simple names, and their names are globally spoken because they are easy."

I told her that the book looked used. Generally, I don't mind buying second-hand books, but I bought this expecting it to be brand new. The sides and corners of the cover are peeled and some, broken. The cover also has some traces of ink.

She then told me that someone must've bought it, read it, then returned it. That it's normal and that she has always done that since amazon lets you return books for free within 15 days, and other places, such as local bookstores, within 7.

I was both surprised and appalled. She must've noticed. She frantically tried to explain herself. The economy, the prices, etc...

Personally, I found her actions wrong and tried explaining to her the losses the publishers and the bookstores face because of this, instead she got mad at me, accused me of hinting that she was a thief, told me I was terrible friend, and left.

I do not believe I was in the wrong for my views towards her actions, but I was wondering if anyone else may have a different opinion regarding this.

For anyone wondering, I'm not in the USA. Not remotely close! But the libby app that everyone is bringing up seems to be very useful, I'm jealous! 🥲"

He then recommended The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss saying that I will like that book since it's Harry Potter for adults. (He didn't mention that the series wasn't finished yet...)

I vividly remember reading it with so much joy! Every chapter kept getting better and better. It was the first time in my life that a book actually gave me a 'wow' moment. I just didn't know a book could be that beautiful.

It's been awhile since I read a book like that. I've read some really good books but nothing spectacular.

Have you ever got that feeling and what book was it?

**EDIT:**
Wow, what a way to wake up! I'm currently reading 'Arsène Lupin, Gentleman-Thief' by Maurice Leblanc (Which is really fun), but I've got some good suggestions what to read next!

- [Shōgun by James Clavell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52382796-sh-gun): I've never read anything placed in Japan, but it looks really good! I have no idea how I'm going to find a copy of that though...

- [The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora): It's been on my ""Want to read""-list for so long now! Apparently the friendship and banter between the two main characters is phenomenally written. I've searched for this book for a long time, but there doesn't seem to be a Dutch translated version of it and my library where I currently can't go to doesn't have the English version...

- [East of Eden by John Steinbeck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden): I've heard so many good things about it, but it seems so biblical to me... Maybe I should read it with an open mind?

- [Pillars of The Earth by Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth): Like East of Eden, I don't know if this book is for me, but who knows?

- [Dune by Frank Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune): I would love to read this, but sadly my bookstore will probably only sell it when the actual Dune movie comes out, with a bookcover that looks like the movieposter. :/

- [The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo): I *need* that book in my life!


There are of course a whole lot of other suggestions, but since I'm not the biggest reader, these books seem like a good way to start (for me atleast)!

I also think that I need to move to another country. I don't seem to be able to find the books I truely want to read... The books I do find, are expensive and badly translated. Don Quixote costed me a fortune (as a student), just because it was translated (it was hilarious though)."
pafomx,Posts from men expressing surprise and delight that they enjoyed a “women’s book” are not heartwarming posts… they are disturbing.,15898,0.62,3503,2021-08-24 09:19:53,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pafomx/posts_from_men_expressing_surprise_and_delight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pafomx/posts_from_men_expressing_surprise_and_delight/,self.books,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Yes, this is partly in response to the recent *Little Women* post, but more broadly about similar posts I have seen here that always seem to get a lot of attention and praise and many comments I’ve seen over the years. 

Like so many other teenage girls in high school, I had to read and relate to 95% male-centric stories written by men. I never questioned why we were reading so many “boy books” because the books were not presented as ""boy books,"" they were just presented as normal literature. The curriculum at my school allowed for just a smidgeon of diversity with *Pride and Prejudice* and *The Scarlet Letter*. This was never seen as an issue; it’s just how it was. I still remember clearly hearing the boys in my small class groaning about having to read a “girl book” when we started *Pride and Prejudice*. The fact that the author was a woman or the main characters women or some combination of those two facts in the boys’ minds was enough to make them sneer at it. It was mildly annoying then, but deeply infuriating and sad now looking back on it years later. Maybe, just maybe, if some of the great female authors and female-centric stories that have been written throughout history had been a part of our Literature curriculums starting from a young age and this was presented as NORMAL, we wouldn’t have high school boys joking and sneering at having to read a “girl book.”

You can see the same scenario when men discover that movies like Mean Girls and Legally Blonde are, in fact, great movies. There was a post like this too recently on the movies subreddit. “I didn’t think I would like a chick flick, but it’s actually really good!” Turns out that women are just people, and stories about them and the things they go through are equally as valid and worthy of being told. What a mind-blowing concept!

The way these statements are phrased as such delightful revelations makes me cringe, and then I feel sad, and then I feel a bit angry, because on some level, whether subconsciously or consciously, the driving force behind these sentiments and posts is that women are “other.” They are not the standard human, they are not fully-fledged standard human people in the same way that men are, so their stories and stories written by them are a sort of “special interest” sub-category of women’s fiction. “Girl books.” “Woman’s book.” “Chick-flicks.” 

Consider this hypothetical scenario and how utterly ludicrous it sounds to us:

*”As a middle-aged woman, I didn’t think I would be able to enjoy *Lord of the Flies*. I don’t know what it’s like to be a boy so I didn’t think I could possibly relate to these characters and their struggles, but I actually really enjoyed it! Even though it’s about male characters, I found the story to be really great overall and dealing with deep themes. It’s not just a boy book, it’s great literature!”*

See? Sounds pretty damn ridiculous, doesn’t it? 

Girls and women are perfectly capable of viewing male-authored/male-centric stories as just normal good literature because that is the way it is presented to us from a young age all the way up to older education. This is how we are conditioned (with no real choice in the matter), while boys and men are never forced to view female-authored/female-centric stories the same way. 

So, next time you see on of these posts, I’m not calling for us to be rude and antagonistic to the OPs, because what they are doing is technically good I suppose, but I dislike the way they are wanting a pat on the back and upvotes simply for viewing women’s stories as good valid literature worthy of being read.

It is sad and disturbing that women continue to be seen as the “other” in fiction, a sub-category separate from the established standard of “good literature.” 

There is no logical reason other than deeply engrained misogyny in society why a man should be that surprised that *Little Women* is a good book. It’s sold millions of copies, had tons of adaptations, is extremely well-known and deeply beloved by people all over the globe. It should not be that surprising that this “women’s book” is in fact, just a good piece of literature regardless of the gender of author or characters. Women are literally just people, and their stories are equally as worthy of being told and read as male stories. We are all part of the same humanity. 

The sentiment of “Wow, this isn’t just for women, it’s actually a good story!” carries the not-so-subtle implication that things that are “for women” are inherently lesser. They are seen as a separate sub-category other than the standard that can sometimes achieve “great literature” status despite their femaleness. The surprise expressed by men who find these stories to be great implies that their perception shifted, they believed something about the “women’s book” before, and now believe something different having read it.

I am 25 now, so I don't know how things are in high schools nowadays. For anyone who does know, are the English Lit curriculums more balanced now or is it still the vast majority of male author/male story? I'm very curious to know. 

I want to hear your thoughts on this matter.

Edit: Huge thank you to the commenters that actually read my post (something that is too much to ask for many people I guess) and understand what I’m saying. This comment from u/SchrodingersHamster is probably buried so I’ll highlight it here: 

“Right, I doubt anyone is sorting by new here anymore but SO many people are missing the point of this post.

OP is not ""discouraging"" men from reading women's literature. Read the post again. She is focusing specifically on the idea that, from a man's perpsective, women's literature being good is surprising, so surprising that it warrants a post on how surprising it is. That the expectation that women's literature (and art in general) is so much lesser than men's that it becomes a shock when a man reads it and enjoys it.

It is NOT OP's responsibility to ""encourage men"" to read women's books. The fact that so many men are unwilling to read women's literature is an issue brought about by patriarchal assumptions that men should be sorting out, not women. Women don't need to hold our hands, guide us to all the great female writers, pat us on the back and give us a gold star when we enjoy it. It is not their responsibility. It is ours as men.

OP should not be praising these men. In fact OP, along with the rest of us, should be criticising these mindsets. We should look at these posts through a critical lens, otherwise how are we supposed to move forward? There are plenty of people on this comment section who would much rather OP kept quiet and that the issue is never highlighted or solved, simply because it might be too upsetting for men to read. If you're a man and that's really how you respond when reading this post, grow up.”"

Just wow. I've grown up watching the movies because my dad is a HUGE Tolkien nerd (translated Sindarin on his own lol). He read me The Hobbit when I was little, and I read the Silmarillion a while back on his recommendation. But until now, I'd never read the actual trilogy because I thought the movies were good enough.

I was so, so wrong. I finished the last chapter at 2am last night after a 6 month journey through the amazing world that Tolkien has crafted. In that time, the world has fallen apart, I was broken up with, left college, and I've been searching for where I want my life to go from here. Perhaps it's the fact that my own journey has been so hard during this time that the books hit me with such enormous emotional power, but I feel as though the world has been changed. Last night, as I said goodbye to the characters and world, I found myself crying. So much of their journey has been my own in these last 6 months, and I could never describe the joy and sorrow I felt as I turned those last pages.

There is an element of safety in fantasy, since you know it isn't real. But for me, the journey has not quite ended, and it is real. This trilogy has given me faith in a happy end, however. And I can thank Master Samwise for that. ""It’s like in the great stories Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn’t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad happened.

My mother and father divorced in 2010, this is when my mother began doing meth. She was in an out of jail a couple times and in febuary of 2013 my mom commited suicide in her jail cell. No letter was ever left. No final goodbye to her 14 year old daughter. Nothing just silence. I may have discovered the last thing my mother ever left to me. So get this... when my mom went to prison the first time she was there for 9 months. After she got out she gave me a bag of books to read. Books that might help me get why she was there.  Or things she thought i would love. She would read them and highlight specific passages in pink highlighter. Things she wanted to say to me but didn't know how.  One of those books was the house of leaves. It was nibbled on in the right corner and had some paint on it. I carried the book for a while but never read it due to its complexity. I sold it to half price books on hulen in 2014. Last week i went to the half price books in Arlington one I had never been to. I bought the house of leaves. And it too was nibbled on in the right corner and had paint. I shrugged it off doubting it could possibly be the same book. I started reading it and now I can't seem to stop. There have been more than a few coincidences at this point. I started skimming thru the book out of boredom... and I found passages highlighted in pink... and one of the passages read.. ""I took my morning walk, I took my evening walk, I ate something, I thought about something, I wrote something, I napped and I dreamt something too, and with all that something, I still have nothing because so much of sum'things has always been and always will be you.

gvt82y,"Every time I re-read Walden, I get more frustrated about the sheer number of high school english teachers who assign it to impressionable youth without even understanding Thoreau's points.",15506,0.89,784,2020-06-03 18:11:43,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gvt82y/every_time_i_reread_walden_i_get_more_frustrated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/gvt82y/every_time_i_reread_walden_i_get_more_frustrated/,self.books,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"I've read Walden four times in the last ten years. I re-read it whenever I feel like I need recentering or if I need something to take me out of today's problems (many of them today which caused my fourth re-read) and it upsets and frustrates me thinking of the thousands of high schoolers who graduate every year being unintentionally (or intentionally?) misled about the points Thoreau was trying to make by clueless english teachers.

**This part of my argument is anecdotal**: in all of the english classes in my high school, and even in music history classes at undergrad, teachers and professors so readily dismiss and mock the points they think thoreau is making when in reality it's not what he's arguing. Some examples:

'It's just cabin porn''He tells everyone to be self-reliant then has his mom do his laundry'

'He tells everyone that he lived alone in the woods for three years but he didn't'

'He shit talks college despite having a degree from harvard'

'He just wants everyone to give away all their stuff and hoe beans all day'

I could go on, but I think enough people get my point and remember these sorts of dismissive, snide remarks about Thoreau. The reality is: none of these were points Thoreau was trying to make, and the worst part is that the misunderstood points he was making are actually proving to be the root of the problems of today's society. He has a whole freaking chapter dedicated to talking about visitors, his preface tells people quite clearly that his intention wasn't to go three years without human contact (quarantine is showing all of us this would be unreasonable for us to expect of someone anyway), he let his mother do his laundry because they had a loving relationship and she wanted to help him, and you know why he didn't spend all three years in the cabin? Because he felt that it was unjust to hide in the woods while people were still allowed to own slaves. He left to help fugitive slaves in Concord because Thoreau was also a fervent abolitionist.

So what did Thoreau want? Here are \*my\* five biggest take-aways from reading Walden

1. He wanted people to live more simply. He thinks we get too attached to the 'surface' of things and never question what's beneath which leads to materialism and sensationalist news influencing our world to a negative outcome. Sound familiar?
2. He believed people should spend more time in nature. Not once did he preach that we should all go live like animals forever and eschew society - he argued that people would benefit from living in nature fronting only the bare essentials of life so they may return to society as better, more sensitized people. Living with nature, we see what matters and what's important \*cough\* climate change\* cough\*
3. He believed education needed reform and rethinking as its the most important part of a child's development. He believed retreating to nature for truth was the most direct route to de-colonizing and that educating the youth in nature and village rather than schoolhouse and university was the most wholesome way to teach children to think for themselves and be liberated from capitalism’s death-grip on the educational system. Maybe this is why high school teachers tell us all to think he's a quack because of the reality that the educational system has some pretty glaring weaknesses?
4. He wanted everyone to speak truthfully. ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"" he didn't want frivolties - he wanted everyone to only speak with sincerity and from the heart. He didn't want to hear about news from Texas while talking to someone in Concord, he wanted to hear what someone's dreams and ambitions were and he wanted all of us to embody the truth and honesty in life rather than the gilded edges.
5. He believed the way our economy was set up kept downtrodden people on the bottom without time to better themselves, because if people on the bottom had the time to learn how to better themselves then the whole system would collapse resulting in a better world. Same argument is used today: the bottom percent is unable to get our of the bottom percent, so bad people stay in power and good people stay in submission because they need money to pay bills.

My point here is not to have everyone drop what they're doing and read Walden or get a Thoreau bust to kiss every morning. My point here is that I really \*really\* dislike the way Walden is taught to impressionable youth. I have friends from all over the country who have had similar experiences with Walden in high school, then I get them to read it again in their 20s, and they get similarly frustrated with how their teachers mishandled his book as a way to shit talk breaking away from capitalism and the less-rosy parts of modern life as something for nutjobs.

The reality is that we need Thoreau's ideas now more than ever. If we had listened to Thoreau, maybe life wouldn't be shit wall-to-wall in America right now. He was against authoritarianism, he was against rampant industrialization for the sake of industrialization (""If everyone lives a simpler life then who will build the railroads?! \[paraphrased\]), he was a firm believer in living with nature, and he was a firm believer that living a simpler, literature and nature- based lifestyle would lead to a healthier society.

You can think I'm a quack too if you want, but Thoreau was right about almost everything and today we suffer the consequences of decades of high school teachers teaching Walden to our youth without even understanding the point of it. I would like to end with a great quote from Walden.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”

I want you to tell me who needs to hear this more than a room full of teenagers. But please, let's keep telling our youth that Thoreau the abolitionist and environmentalist was full of shit.

Update: hold your keyboard if you're going to accuse me of generalizing english teachers, you're just gonna make yourself look like a chucklehead. Who should I blame for Walden being mis-taught? The math teachers?

Update II Electric Boogaloo: To those thinking I'm making stuff up and this doesn't happen - the thousands of upvotes seem to say otherwise?

Update III: The Updatening: I want to thank those of you who have shared your similar experiences to mine. When this post was a wee lad a lot of the earlier comments were rather toxic towards me accusing me of making this up. To quote one of my favorites down below - ""No one, anywhere, in the history of history, has taught Walden in the way that OP is claiming, so OP is just essentially offended by, and responding to, their own idea. Just ridiculous."" So thank you for keeping me from successfully being gaslighted (gaslit?... Gaslighted...? Gaslighted. Yeah.)"

I loved him in *Friends* and for a long time was feeling very sympathetic towards him and his struggles, addiction can get to the best of people and I do admire those who keep fighting. But this book was something else. A blatant lack of self-awareness, narcissism and inflated ego was just too much.

This is the man, who admits he cheated on basically each of his girlfriends, yet at the same time thinks ""he's a very good person, he would never hurt anyone and God can see this"".

This is the man who hurt and drove away those who helped him the most, those who spent months with him in hospitals and rehabs, risking their careers and private lives, and suddenly were disposable when he was discharged because ""as long as I'm sober, I don't need them any more and now they're needy"".

This is the man who constantly shits on every person more successful than him. Who thinks that every bad thing that happened to him must be the fault of someone else. That he's not even in the slightest responsible for how his life looks like, because ""it's a disease, and you're lucky you don't have it, woe is me, I don't have any control over it"". Who destroyed so many movies because of his addiction, and once just disappeared for 6 months during the production to go on a binge and later detox, and is in absolute shock they sued him for financial loses. ""How could they, it was health issue??"". Who hurt every woman he's every been with, but when his ex (!) informs him she's getting married and won't be able to attend his play he says ""her emailing me about it is the worst thing someone has done to me, I would NEVER do that to a person, how could she"". The whole book is just constant self-serving ""me, myself and I, why everyone around me is always wrong and why all I did to myself and other people is not my fault"". I was physically ill by the end of this book.

The narcissism is so obvious it's not even funny. Early in his career his supposed friend rejected role of Chandler, which he obviously later regretted seeing how it played out for Matthew. What Perry has to say about it? He just randomly quotes a journalist saying that it was a blessing to the world it was Perry who was cast and that his friend would be a shitty Chandler anyway. Who the hell would do something like that to a friend? Did you just kept this quote memorized for 20+ years or went out of your way to locate any negative comment about your friend to include this in your memoir? Absolutely shocking. More on narcissism - he writes his first play in 10 days and self proclaims it as ""great work better than classics"" and gets all annoyed that it was demolished by critics. Did it ever occur to him that maybe it wasn't that good and he could work on it more? Of course not, critics just don't understand his genius, and besides, here's one semi-positive review he found - proceeds to quote it in its entirety. Yes, quoting passages praising Matthew Perry takes quite big portion of this book.

As for his addiction, this is something that happens to him against his will, he would love to trade places even with homeless or broke people, they don't get how hard he got it in life with his addicted brain. He'd love to stop, but when even the slightest hardship happens in his life, he just has to drink or use. It's just how his body works, not his fault, you're lucky if you don't have this disease. People who overcame addiction? Oh, they had it easy, easier version, easier to overcome, lucky bastards. He's one of the few that got the hardest version and he's a hero for living with it every day.

I could go on, but let's stop here. If this was a work of fiction, I'm certain people would find it almost unbelievable. You can't be that dense and oblivious to all of your faults, this is just bad writing. But here we are - the person who carefully made sure to only surround himself with yes-men is unable to see or admit he is the only constant in every situation that he messed up. What a surprise. Good luck with sobriety with the attitude of constant whining and looking for others to blame, you'll need that, Matthew."

9it4if,I just finished reading all of the Sci-Fi on Reddit's 200 most recommended books,15469,0.93,1239,2018-09-25 21:00:16,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9it4if/i_just_finished_reading_all_of_the_scifi_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/9it4if/i_just_finished_reading_all_of_the_scifi_on/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"I have always been a sci-fi fan, but it always bothered me whenever I saw a list of the best Sci-Fi (according to whoever) and I'd read (or even heard of) so few of them. Over the better part of the past decade I've collected names of books and notable lists of best Sci-Fi and have been slowly increasing the number of books I've read that are considered the best of my favourite genre. It's been great and I have no intention of stopping!

About 2-3 years ago I decided to take on [Reddit's most recommended Sci-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/fiction#wiki_science-fiction). There were several books that I'd already read, and a bunch I'd never even heard of, and since I'm a Redditor, and the list overlaps with a lot of other lists that I mentioned above, I decided I'd go for completion. Ultimately It's a partial completion, since some of the recommendations are for a full series and there are some that I only read Book 1 rather than the whole series, but with that one caveat, as of the other day, when I made it to the last page of *The Book of Ler*, I have officially completed the list!

I just wanted to mark the occasion by sharing some thoughts, joys, and disappointments with everyone here:

**A Fire Upon the Deep** Is an absolute stand out. I had no idea what to expect. I'd never heard of Vernor Vinge so it's one of those books that when I'd see it on a list, it just never stuck out for me. Basically, it blew my mind. It's rare to come across the perfect triple threat of world-building, plot, and characters but I don't think I'd be over-stating it if I said this one got high marks on all three. It is now one of my favorite books.

**Book of the New Sun** inspires ambivalent feelings. I read *Shadow & Claw* which is actually 2 of 4 books in the series. If I'd stopped after the first book, I'd probably have just written it off as not my thing/overrated and moved on, but I finished the second, and while it never fully drew me, by the end I was interested in finding out more about what was going on. I might read the rest of the series, but it holds a weird place for me where I have interest without enjoyment.

**Cloud Atlas** is a great example of interesting writing. I'm probably not alone in having difficulty staying immersed with the frequent change in setting, but I can say that once I got through the first half, I couldn't put it down. 

**The Mote in God's Eye** was... interesting. I wanted to call it out because it has some issues that I've been running into a lot with sci-fi from the 60s and 70s that's increasingly difficult to ignore. *The Mote in God's Eye* features a single female human who serves 2 purposes: to be a love interest and to explain (a super conservative version of) human reproduction to aliens. I guess I'm supposed to overlook that and just enjoy the story about aliens, but I have a hard time believing that in 1974 neither of the two authors knew what they were doing when they included a passage explaining why there were no women allowed on space missions.

**Red Mars** is just awesome. I can't remember if I read it before or after I committed to this list, but it stands out either way. It's a legitimate must-read in the genre and since I've read the trilogy, I intend to read more by Kim Stanley Robinson.

**The Saga of Seven Suns** is one that I was not familiar with (although I've read several books by Kevin J. Anderson) and wasn't sure what to expect. I only read the first book, but I'm definitely open to reading the rest at some point. There's a lot of world-building and it promises to be a large epic the likes of which you typically expect in the Fantasy genre. It's not my favorite on the list, but it's certainly enjoyable enough and introduces some interesting ideas about aliens and interstellar diplomacy. 

Thanks for reading my mini treatise :)

I have a problem.

My 84 year old grandfather is writing a novel, and has asked me to help edit it and give ""candid comments."" I'm 100 pages in, and objectively, it's a terrible book. The writing is bad, the dialogue is completely unbelievably, as are the characters, the story is uninteresting, the chronology is all confused, etc. I have literally nothing good to say about it.

My grandfather is a very smart man (attended Columbia and Yale), and he thinks very highly of himself and his writing abilities. He refuses to take a writing course or join a writer's workshop (""Why would I do that? I know how to write!""), and I know that he's going to ask me about it, expecting a glowing review. And I don't know what to do.

On the one hand, it'll never get published so it kind of doesn't matter if I tell him it's great to make him feel good. On the other hand, he does want to write something good, and I don't want to completely lie to him.

Anyone out there ever experienced something similar, or have any advice? Much appreciated :)

Edits:
1. Holy crap Reddit, thanks for all the responses! I really appreciate all the input, and couldn't have ever imagined that this would make it to the front page of Reddit.
2. The book is about four boys on a baseball team who become friends, and the ways that their lives remain entwined in their adulthood.
3. Part of the problem is that my grandfather did publish a novel a few years ago, which is partly where his ego in relation to his writing ability comes from. It wasn't great, but it was better.
4. I think what I'll most likely do is a combination of your various advice: lie a bit about it being better than it is, then soften my main criticisms as much as possible. Again, thanks to everyone! "

I work a typical 9-5 job, 40 hours a week and between work, going to the gym, cooking my own meals, cleaning my home, attending social events and all else, life gets busy so fast. 

Being someone that adores reading, having a library card is THE BEST. I don't always have the budget to buy a brand new book, or the time and energy to find a good epub version of my to-read books but the library is a place I can go to and get free books at my leisure, FREE. Most of the time I can extend my loan and have the books for over a month. 

I don't know why people don't read more, it shuts down my crazy mind and allows for another world, another view, to take over for awhile and to me, that's freedom.

That's what the library gives me, free books and freedom. Seriously, everyone should go at least once a month. It's therapeutic."
hup36z,I'm dyslexic so reading has always been hard for me.

Reading for more than 20-30 minutes at a time often becomes both physically and mentally distressing for me.  I often have to re-read entire paragraphs or pages because I was thinking about something else, or I will mis-read a word that changes the sentence and confuses the hell out of me.  My eyes will often cross or go blurry which can sometimes lead to headaches.  Because of this, reading an entire novel will typically take me weeks or months to complete. 

Yesterday I sat and read the entire 2nd half of The Eighth Guardian by Merideth McCardle in a single sitting and it felt amazing.  Her 1st person writing style kept my ADD in check as it was constantly on to the next revelation, or experience, without feeling hectic.  I was so thoroughly engaged in the story of time travelling spies that I immediately went and bought the other two in the series.  Dyslexia still reared it's ugly head a few times but I was able to power through it for the first time in my life. 

After feeling like giving up on reading so many times in my life, it seems that all it took was the right book to make me realize that I could do it too."

[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.

Ebooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. 



Please ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. 


# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address

First you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it’s way easier to find on your kindle.  


**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**


Harder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> 

https://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg

 


under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” -> 

https://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png

 


Click “Devices” in the menu near the top ->

https://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png

 


click the “…” next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  

https://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png

 


(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have “devices” going back for many years of phones) 

Your send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com



 

# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.

 

On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click “Account & Lists” -> 

https://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg

 

under “Digital content and devices” click “Content and Devices” ->

https://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png




click “Preferences"" in the top bar of that page -> 

https://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png

 

Click “Personal Document Settings” -> 

https://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png

 

find “Approved Personal Document E-mail List” on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  

https://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png




# 3 - Let’s send a book.  

 

Go to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. 

https://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png

 

Now open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  

Go to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  

I typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.

I’ve been reading about 50 pages of it a day for a while now, and I gotta day, it’s not all that it’s acclaimed to be.

It’s not that I don’t dislike the ideology, per say. I mean, I don’t prescribe to Ayn Rand’s world views, but that’s not the reason I don’t like it. In fact, I often really enjoy alternative perspectives in writing. It’s just that she’s so blunt about it. I dunno - maybe that’s the reason a lot of people like it! I just find it so unsatisfying to read two or three times a page about how great monopolies are and how much government sucks.

If you want me to believe what you’re writing, you have to sell it to me. What makes George Orwell so great is his ability to clearly state a message, yet also thinly veil it in symbolism and metaphor. It makes it feel genuine, not forced. Ray Bradbury does the same thing with “Fahrenheit 451”. The world feels natural, as does the message.

For “Atlas Shrugged”, though, it’s just not. The line between good and bad is so black-and-white it’s cliche, and not in a clever way either.  All the characters speak in the same way too. They literally sound like they’re all the same person. Furthermore, it’s not just that the characters sound the same; all the protagonists practically have the same features!

I’m going to describe a character, and you’re going to have to tell me which one it is: They’re gaunt, have steely blue eyes, and a cold demeanor. Who is it? You can’t tell me, can you. THEYRE ALL THE SAME. 

It’s really frustrating because people kept telling me how good this book was going to be. I usually love political-fiction. It’s my favorite genre, in fact. So why is this so terrible? I mean, I’ve kept reading because it’s so bad it’s almost kind of good, but then it just keeps going back to bad. I’m honestly disappointed."

Some are a unique commentary on real world issues, some a play on words and some just plain absurd. What are your favourite quotes from across the series, and what is is about them that makes them memorable? 

Obviously, spoiler tag anything  would be a give-away for others i.e the final message in So Long and Thanks For All The Fish.

A few for starters:

&nbsp;

* *The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. 
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.* - A critique of political office as old as the office itself
* *The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.* - A great early example of the unexpected to come
* *He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.* - This one always seemed to show a great understanding of some of the illogical parts of modern idicum.
* *This man is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world.* - I don't actually know why I like this one so much!
* *Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.* - Something that can resonate with everyone"

I sometimes miss on essential information because of that and I have to go back when I finish reading a chapter to get a fuller picture of what just happened. Does anyone else do the same? If so, what are your  strategies for dealing with the ""extra"" information (i.e. sentences other than the dialogue or description of fight) when reading an action scene for the first time?

I had it happen last night while I was re-reading (for about the tenth time) Count of Monte Cristo. I know what is coming up, but I just so desperately want to get to the next action point that I could feel my eyes wandering.

If you don't know who that is, please do not be alarmed. I can help you! I am very helpful! For example, did you know that tacos stay more intact and are easier to eat if you spread the beans and guacamole across the inside of the taco shell before adding the other ingredients? 
 
Now that you have a better idea of how helpful I can be, here is a more direct answer: 
 
The first thing I did was this: http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com
 
And, because of that, I was allowed to do this: http://hyperboleandahalfbook.blogspot.com
 
Seven years later, I finally managed to do this: https://solutionsandotherproblemsbookpage.blogspot.com
 
Good job, me! 
 
Anyway, if you're willing to be aware of me and also the fact that I wrote another book, the least I can do is answer your questions. Or maybe you just want to say something weird to somebody. No problem—I can do that for you. I would be a perfect person to say something weird to. I have both the ability to read, and the ability to know weird things. 
 
Other interests include (but are not limited to): animals, feelings, puzzles, Hearthstone/Magic: the Gathering, math, physics, ethics, mental health, baseless speculation about pointless bullshit that doesn't need to be wondered and can't be answered in a meaningful way, cooperation, problem-solving, and doing my best. I am 35 years old. My favorite time is 5pm. My strongest skill is trying.   
 
I've got all day and most of tomorrow, so let's figure some shit out or something.

**Update:** Gonna pause the AMA for the evening, but I'll be back to keep answering some questions tomorrow, if that's cool with you guys! Thank you for the questions and conversation so far!

**Update #2:** I forgot to tell you guys that I'm answering questions again, but I'm answering questions again! I'm gonna work my way through and also check the newer replies, but please upvote any questions you see that you'd like me to answer!"

I ended up getting Norse Mythology because I thought it might an interesting read and my girls saw it and wanted in.  We ended up reading a chapter/story every night and they couldn't get enough of it.  Last night we came to the ending story of Ragnarok and they were totally entranced.  I try and do voices and act out things when I read to them and my youngest took it a step farther by acting out the battle in her room while I was reading.  Experiences like this make being a parent special.  

I found that the writing was really easy to get into.  It felt like I was an old storyteller relating long lost legends to a new generation (which I guess I was).  I really hope that he decides to tackle other mythologies because I would love to be able to share more old stories with my kids.  

Edit: This really blew up and I am so amazed by all of you.  I ended up creating a Twitter account to let Neil Gaiman know about this post and he responded with a big thank you.  This has gotten over 134,000 views and my inbox exploded.  I will try and respond to everyone as I can.  Thank you to all of you for being awesome!!!"

bz0kn1,People who discourage kids from reading books for dumb reasons,14995,0.91,1126,2019-06-10 22:51:44,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bz0kn1/people_who_discourage_kids_from_reading_books_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bz0kn1/people_who_discourage_kids_from_reading_books_for/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,,False,"I volunteer at my local library, and I've seen this happening a lot. A kid picks a book, and the parents find a reason to give it a fault. Either it has too many pictures, or no pictures at all, or it's ""not your thing"", or it's too long or too short. It's even worse when they say it mockingly.

From time to time I try to intervene and say something in the lines of ""hey, I happened to have read this book with my little sister, and I found it really good"" to try to convince the parents to let the kid read the book, but I don't do that too often because no one likes strangers bringing in their unsolicited opinions. 

I started reading when I was 11, and it was the diary of a wimpy kid. I was going grocery shopping with my family and instead of going to the toys aisle with my sisters as usual I decided to take a look at the books (even though I had no interest in books at all). I happened to find the book cover interesting and was immediately hooked in in the first sentences. It was funny and easy to read. Five years later I was reading the picture of dorian gray in english even though it was my third language.

Everytime we see a kid with a book, we should let them know they're doing good. I would say there are exceptions, but those refer just to objectively bad books. Outside of that, there aren't many bad books, *especially* for kids. Let them read what they find curious, let them find joy in it and let their interest grow. I'm not saying parents shouldn't do anything, but at this age it's important to let kids have fun with such a healthy hobby."

Here are the books that I read and the days that I finished:

Turtles All the Way Down, John Green,  February 22

The Rules of Magic, Alice Hoffman, March 6

Americanah, Chiamanda Ngozi Adichie, April 19

Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado, May 1

The Power, Naomi Alderman, May 19

Dark Places, Gillian Flynn, July 10

The Hate U Give, Angie Thomas, some time in August

Unaccustomed Earth, Jhumpa Lahiri, September 3

The Child Finder, Rene Denfeld, September 4

Sourdough, Robin Sloan, September 7

The Vegetarian, Han Kang, September 17

Baby Teeth, Zoje Stage, September 22


Highlights: 

Americanah: This was captivating! Achidie’s sharp observations were really great to read. It took me a good amount of time but it was so enjoyable and worth it. This was probably my favorite in the list!

Unaccustomed Earth: Simply beautiful. This book was such a treat. Lahiri’s ability to write with such depth and insight about people and their relationships made this really stand out.

Low: The Child Finder. Ugh. I live in a small town. I had trouble relating to the commentary on small towns and their dynamics. Simply put, this book seemed a bit shallow and was my least favorite.
 
Not a low but a CREEPY: Dark Places & Baby Teeth. I could only read these during the day. These will probably stick with me for awhile. They were excellent and it helped having some thrillers on the list.

What’s next? Keep reading!! Who knows, maybe I’ll get to 18 or 20 by the end of the year. 

Did you set out on a reading goal this year? How is it going? Where are you at? What has stood out to you so far?

Edit: I am overwhelmed! This community is a HUGE motivator for picking up reading again and staying interested. Thank you for all of your insights and well wishes. I’m reading all of them and will try my best to respond. Let’s keep reading!! 

Edit 2: The dates! Hopefully this will clear up any confusion."

(IE: the only books worth reading are non-fiction business books like Start With Why and Good to Great).

This enrages me. I read a lot of business non-fiction and most of it is repetitive vague garbage. I predict that AI will be writing the top selling business non-fiction in 5-10 years. 

Fiction has taught me how to be a human being. Fiction has made me a better person.

szqnue,I spent a week trying to get engrossed in a book before realizing it was Christian fiction.,14700,0.87,1740,2022-02-24 01:39:50,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/szqnue/i_spent_a_week_trying_to_get_engrossed_in_a_book/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/szqnue/i_spent_a_week_trying_to_get_engrossed_in_a_book/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"So, I'm a mystery/thriller guy. I like my crime stories, with cops and serial killers and races against clocks. I'm browsing my local book joint, and I spot this book called *Nightfall*. 

""Okay,"" I thought to myself. ""Cool name.""

I read the blurb, blah blah BAU Agent racing to find serial killer before he releases a virus. Ambitious jump, but sounds fun. Has a female protagonist, we need more of that in this mostly male-led genre. Female author, which also means there probably isn't a paragraph dedicated to deceased victim's corpse titties.

Book dudes, I tried. Despite the good reviews, it just felt kinda... basic? And not like, in the cookie cutter way you'd watch a procedural crime show. Like, the author had the topic thought up and said ""good enough.""

Like, the cult was called *The Circle*, they followed *The Book*, and to get out you... just say you want out. That's it. Now call me skeptical, but I think cults are a bit more complex than that. She might as well have called them *The Antagonists*.

Then we have our characters- main girl atheist, who is related to someone in the cult, a blonde Christian love interest fellow agent that *couldn't be with someone who didn't believe*, and a barrage of various white FBI guys that might as well have been interchangeable. This would be forgivable in books with complex fantasy political systems, but not a straightforward mystery.

What finally tipped me off that this book was kind of weird was this educated FBI agent berating this caretaker black Christian woman that her God is basically the same as the cult. Like, no? No educated FBI agent apart of a BEHAVIORAL unit would make that out-there claim. Not even close to being the same, that's the thought process of an angst teen atheist.

I looked up what the ACFW award was, because like a buffoon, I saw award and was like, ""that seems like a good indicator,"" and saw it stood for American Christian Fiction Writers.

Fuuuuuuuck me, so much clicked into place after that. The Christian love interest, the protagonist being a shithead to an old lady, the lack of actual cult knowledge. No wonder I felt like I was being preached to, I fucking was.

Why do I rant this? Christian writers, you need to up your game. Christian readers, you need to up your standards. I have no issue with the fact that it's Christian, I have issue with the fact that its just *not good*. Its just... lazy. And I'm reading books that are usually pretty simple to write. If I can see these issues, then there's a problem.

EDIT: I didn't write this post to shit on Christians. You're not funny with ""hurrdurr I thought you meant THE BIBLE"".  Christian fiction that treats non-Christians as bad/ugly/whatever deserves shit. Not Christians themselves.

FURTHER EDIT: Hi r/all. I'm just going to say, its been brought to my attention that the language I used was pretty dismissive of writers like Tolkien and C.S. Lewis and even Brandon Sanderson (who I didnt know was a Mormon). I should clarify I meant books that are Christian Fiction, written by Christians pushing a narrative that everyone but them is wrong. As many others have pointed out, this is an issue with Christian media many other Christians see is a problem. I apologize for making it seem like I lumped in talented writers that are Christian with these folks, but the fact remains: the Christian Fiction I'm talking about is bad/bland/boring/inflammatory towards non-Christians. Christian consumers that regularly read these books, please. Stop giving them a market. They're either pushing their warped views of the world on you, or their grifting off of you by appealing to some very tightly held beliefs. Either way, yall don't deserve that."

As flawed as I am, I love literature with all of my heart. The books that I've read and loved have become a part of who I am, a part of myself which I nurture and cherish. Something that cannot be taken from me.

My first time in jail, I was terrified. I was 25 years old, in a new state, and doing 30 days. Jail is cruel and dehumanizing but most of all it's boring. It was such a relief to find that my county jail actually had a decent little library! I read at least one novel, sometimes two, every single day I was in that jail.

It was there that I discovered Gene Wolf's *Book of the New Sun*, now a favorite series of mine. I discovered Faulkner and Southern Gothic literature, something that I adore to this day. I read Steinbeck, outside of the scope of what they had us read in school. Reading was just about the only self care I was capable of in that awful place, and despite the best efforts of the criminal justice system, I left that place having been enriched; a more worldly and nuanced person than I was when I went in.

I ended up in jail again last month. At a different jail now, I was disappointed to find that this jail had a far smaller library, mostly John Grisham and Nora Roberts books and very little actual literature. Then I stumbled across a copy of Le Guin's *The Wind's Twelve Quarters*. I very nearly cried when I found it. Le Guin is probably my favorite author, and finding this collection of short stories was like a revelation that I would be ok, I'd survive, I wasn't truly as alone as I thought. After some digging I also found her Earthsea series, which I hadn't read, as I generally don't read much fantasy. Escaping into those books allowed me to escape my circumstances, and again allowed me to nurture that eternal piece of myself. I also had the pleasure of reading what was supposedly the first novel ever written, *The Tale of Genji*. I got to have a little bit of a reading vacation, in a world where you are expected to be crushed and humiliated.

Please, if you have books you'd like to donate, consider your local jail. The people in those walls are suffering, they are marginalized people, the very people who can be most profoundly impacted by good literature. You may be saving a life, and I guarantee that if you donate even just one good book, you'll definitely be improving one. There is nothing as powerful as a good book that gets you through a bad time."

*…it’s that familiar-sounding titles drive sales because they help give readers a small feeling of comfort when they’re contemplating which book to purchase out of the thousands and thousands available.

Naturally, I sought out work by Carl Sagan from recommendations and glowing reviews along the way, and I loved his work on the TV show ""Cosmos:  A Personal Voyage"" (as well as the book of the same name), but I **never** thought I'd end up reading a book *dripping* with insight into so many topics that I admire (I just finished reading today -- took me two sittings as I just couldn't stop). 

From the importance of skepticism in all things (not just in science, but life in general); the failings of human memory (false memories, implanted memories, and the power of hypnosis); the dangers of all kinds of dogma (witch-hunts, the inquisition, New Age healing, fundamentalist religion); the baloney detection kit (i.e. understanding fallacious arguments, or sensationally fallacious media stories, that use ad hoc, ad hominem, straw man, appeal to ignorance, etc... elements); and how all of this (plus more that I didn't mention) ties into the need for continual support of science, education and a literate social class that can apply these, and many other important rational methods, into our every day lives (while convincingly elucidating the wonder and awe that is all around us -- collapsing stars, quasars, pulsars, the human genome, the vibrancy of life found on Earth, etc..). 

Sagan does this in such an easy to read, down-to-earth manner that makes every topic he speaks of so easily approachable (right down to explaining the general relation between Faraday's law, electromagnetism, and Maxwell's equations, and the profound impact a couple of equations has had on our society -- things that I never thought about, or read before).

This book has re-invigorated my wonder for humanity, and our capacity to grow as a species in the face of ignorance, hatred, war, and dangerous credulity. I honestly can't praise this work enough. "

If a female character is written as nice, she's called submissive and anti feminist.

If she's muscly and badass, she's too much like a man.

She wants to get married and have a family? Sexist.

She never wants to have children, maybe doesn't even like children? Sexist.

She's attractive? Pandering to male gaze (because fuck us queer women, amirite? We don't like looking at attractive women 🙄). Sexist.

She's unattractive? Pandering to purity culture. Sexist.

If a male author created her, he's misogynist because he's a man, so of course he's misogynist.

If a female author created her, she's got internalized misogyny and has fallen victim to the patriarchy.

These attitudes are prevalent everywhere, but I think, from my personal experience, book communities are the worst. Some of the people here have an issue with almost every single female character, regardless of what she's like or who has written her.

If men can't write women, and women can't write women, who, in your opinion, qualifies for this apparently impossible task? Do you think female characters just can't be done right, no matter who writes them, or how they're written and portrayed?

It's getting exhausting. We as woman are people. We're as different from each other as men are. I don't see why we should be put on some kind of pedestal, or why there needs to be some kind of nitpicking about us.

These people need to just admit they have an issue with women. Yes, they. Not these authors. They.

You know that saying, if you met an asshole today then you met an asshole, but if everyone you meet today is an asshole then you're the asshole?

Same goes here.

If every female character you come across is sexist to you, then you are the sexist one."

Their profits jumped 80% in 2017 and that's because physical book sales in the UK are a growing market again.

The chain looked much like B&N back in 2011 but was turned around but a new CEO.  His big plan? Decentralised decision making and going back to traditional book selling practices. Here's some key quotes from the rather detailed wiki page:

> In September 2011, the bookseller announced that it intended to drop its 3-for-2 deal on books after a decade in place.[48] The offer was replaced with a 'bespoke offer', based on branches choosing their own pricing structures from available discounts.[49]

>2013 saw the start of an overhaul of the company's business strategy, with centralised decision making giving way to store-based decisions and a renewed emphasis on traditional bookselling techniques.[69]

>Waterstones launched a number of new partnerships through the year, including with the University of Derby to launch a professional qualification programme for its staff,[73] with the Folio Society to extend customer reach and stock selection in London-based bookshops,[74] and partnering with a new charity, BookTrust.[75] 

>In a 2016 interview with Daunt, he stated that Amazon ""defines how Waterstones acts"" and while Waterstones could not compete with the internet retailer digitally, it could offer a credible alternative, believing there was ""a future in physical bookselling."" [97] Waterstones continued to look at ""fixing the basics"" during 2016, such as adjusting store opening hours and harnessing data from the loyalty card[98] as well as refurbishment of physical stores, including the Canterbury branch,[99] and work on its e-commerce routes through improvements to product ranking.

Essentially, the company lets individual stores have a huge amount of autonomy for a national chain. This allows them to experiment and work out how best to sell books for their area. What works in one area isn't the optimal for everywhere else. They see their staff's knowledge on books as a critical business asset. Through this empowerment, they have turned the business around from a potential blockbuster to a growing business, both in number of stores and profits.

Physical books are a growing market again but you need to adjust your business model to innovate and keep on top of trends. This could be a model that B&N could use to avoid being a relic of the past.

He says himself that his books have had over 6 million downloads (including both paid and free promotional copies). He runs the Self Publishing Formula course and podcast, he talks at the 20BooksTo50K conference in Vegas, and he’s part of a new initiative called Fuse Publishing. He’s a pretty big deal in self-publishing, so what he does reflects on self-publishing as a whole.

I was wondering how this guy published so many books in so little time and I found my answer: he stole a lot of his material.

* \[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian\] “the gaudy harlequinade of youth much in evidence”

* \[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson\] “The man settled behind the rifle. He felt the tension in the trigger, found his stockweld and slid up to the eyepiece, staring into it and seeing the ridge and the trees and the vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle.”

&#x200B;

* \[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter\] ”Then pulling out his Kestral 4000 weather station and noting the wind, humidity, and temperature.”

* \[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy\] “We pass the iron girder skeleton of a building that never seems to get finished”
* \[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson\] “Milton passed the iron girder skeleton of a building”

&#x200B;

* \[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy\] “little shops, outlets for cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs, and heroin—which in Juarez are called picaderos, usually marked by a shoe tied to a nearby telegraph wire”
* \[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson\] “Milton knew about Juarez \[…\] Illicit outlets—picaderos—were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires, and their shifty proprietors sold whatever illicit substance you needed to get high”

&#x200B;

* An older version of Saint Death said “Illicit outlets––picaderos––were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires and their shifty proprietors sold cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs and heroin. The legitimate marketplace at Cerrajeros was busy with custom, a broad sweep of unwanted bric-a-brac for sale: discarded furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator fridges.” but he changed it. So it was even more plagiarized before. You can look it up in Google and it’ll show up, though it leads to a weird scam site which will try to convince you that you have a virus on your computer but I still think that counts as proof as I’m assuming the scam site simply copied an older version of his book verbatim before he sent out an update through Kindle to cover up his more blatant plagiarism.
* This also matches up to another passage from Amexica: “… lines the streets in overload quantities: sixties furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator cookers and Osterizer blenders…” So Mark changed sixties furniture to discarded furniture and Kelvinator cookers to Kelvinator fridges. Nice.

And I found all this in an hour or two, just looking at a few of his books, and only looking at the first few pages which were available for free in the Kindle sample and typing suspicious sentences into Google. He’s probably plagiarized a lot more and hidden it with after-the-fact edits and rearranging words in a way that’s harder to check using a search engine.

Basic rule: read through one of his books and type any phrase that seems either interesting and profound or technical about matters he’s not familiar with like guns into Google in quotes. You’ll probably find that he took it from somewhere else.

“Harlequins of youth much in evidence?” Never heard that sentence before. Oh, he didn’t write it.

“Fur-trimmed Afghans?” What are those? Oh, he probably doesn’t know either. Because he didn’t write it.

“Misty slopes of the massif” “Mil-dot-rich reticle” “iron girder skeleton of a building” etc.

For original prose you get clunky purple prose like “the sun glared down, a myriad of shafts that lanced into his eyes.” I mean, a myriad of shafts sounds like you’re talking about golf clubs or genitals. I would HOPE neither of those are lancing you in the eye.

It seems unfair that he’s reportedly sold 6 million books and is so involved in these groups while heavily plagiarizing when books like *How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life* get cancelled entirely for plagiarism. But maybe in self-publishing things just work differently. But I feel like an author who sells 6 million books should be held to a higher standard whether they’re self-published or not.

(If this was not the right sub to post something like this, then I apologize and I'll take it down. I just thought more people should know about this because it seems like most of his fans have no idea he plagiarizes.)

&#x200B;

EDIT: A previous of this version incorrectly stated that Mark Dawson wrote 20 books in 2 years. This was based on a cursory look of his Wikipedia page, where it seems to suggest he published 20 books (meaning both novels and novellas) from 2013 to 2015. However, it has been brought to my attention that many people took 'book' to mean full-length novel, not novella, and that a lot of these books had either been written previously and were just now being published, or had listed co-authors. So 20 novels and novellas with his name on them were published between 2013 and 2015 according to his Wikipedia bibliography, but that doesn't mean he necessarily wrote 20 books in 2 years. Apologies for any misinformation.

Hopefully after that blunder I still have some credibility.

EDIT 2: I’ve now reached out to Vox, Forbes, the New York Times, the Guardian, and CBS News with tips.

Some people were also telling me to reach out to various YouTubers and internet personalities to see if they were interested in tweeting about it or investigating it further, but many of them have their Twitter DMs closed and only have brand emails for emailing about sponsorships and such which are only read by a third party. So if you would like to see them talk about this and you know better ways to contact them, feel free to send it their way.

But for now I’m going to focus less on getting the word out and more on finding new examples of plagiarism within Mark Dawson’s other books.

Cheers.

EDIT 3: It seems I've found another source of inspiration.

* “tree allees, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, boxwood parterres” \[[http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html](http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html)\]
* “tree allées, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, and boxwood parterres” \[The Driver by Mark Dawson (62% of sample on Kindle)\]

If you look up even the shortened form “tree allées, expansive lawns” only the article and The Driver appear. Doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The website is copyrighted for 2013, while The Driver came out in January 4, 2014, according to Goodreads. Mark does noticeably fix the spelling of allées though, so that’s nice.

EDIT 4: He really likes the Morgan Estate apparently.

* “A majestic wrought iron gate brought in from a Southern plantation” \[[http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/](http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/)\] (again copyrighted for 2013)
* “a majestic wrought-iron gate that looked like it belonged on a Southern plantation” \[The Driver by Mark Dawson (60% of sample)\]

EDIT 5:

* \[A quote by Stephen Thomas Erlewine which is available from many sources including the All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music from 2001, page 396; notably, this is also the bio for the band on iHeart\] “Suede kick-started the Brit pop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single.”
* \[The Driver by Mark Dawson, 2014, 69% of sample (nice)\] “He liked the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions from the Madchester era and the sharp, clean three-minute singles that had evolved out of it. Suede and Sleeper and Blur.”

“Swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions” is a pretty generic phrase though, don’t you think? Could definitely just be a coincidence.

EDIT 6:

* \[Page 169 of Mayfair Magazine October 2013\] “oak parquetry floor, inlaid with ebony wood, with a gilded fireplace from a palazzo near Florence, Italy, no less.”
* \[77% of sample of The Driver, published in 2014\] “oak parquetry floor inlaid with ebony, a gilded fireplace that belonged in a palazzo as the focal point of the wall”

EDIT 7:

* \[ [http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html](http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html) \] (2013) “The upper silk fabric walls that blend with the original wainscoting painted by Dutch painter Van Amstel set the unique intimately warm tone of this office that includes a private powder room and a large wood burning fireplace.”
* \[79% of sample of The Driver from 2014\] “Silk fabric walls blended with painted wainscoting. There was a private powder room and a large wood-burning fireplace.”

Again, it may seem like it’s not plagiarism, but think about the elements of the sentence. The word order is the same: silk fabric walls, then wainscoting, then the powder room, then the fireplace. And the powder room is specifically private, and the fireplace is specifically large and fire-burning, and the walls specifically blend with the wainscoting. Though the sentences look different, the structure and verbiage is pretty much identical. It doesn’t even seem like Mark read this once and recalled it from memory. It seems like he wrote the first quote down word for word, then looked for a way to edit it so it might not show up on an automated plagiarism checker.

There’s also another similarity with I, Sniper and Tarantula. They both contain this phrase: “in a steady two-hand grip, trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard.” Both halves of that phrase seem somewhat commonplace, but the combined phrase is unique to those two.

Also a lot of people were saying “That’s just how snipers operate,” and I agree that technical jargon and actions are going to be described similarly in different works. There aren’t that many ways to say someone shot a gun or slammed a door shut. But the larger context is the similarity of both scenes overall:

In I, Sniper, (1 through 5 are in the span of three paragraphs):

1. The protagonist Bob settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, and sees the world through the the mil-dot-rich reticle)
2. He diddles with the focus ring until it declares the world pristine and hard-edged at five to eight hundred yards
3. He uses a Leica laser
4. He pulls out a Kestral 4000 weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)
5. He runs the data through his Palm Pilot, dials them into the scope of his rifle, then adjusts for windage
6. Then a few paragraphs later, he is alone in the world of scope, home in the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, his finger on the trigger

In Tarantula, (1 through 5 are in the span of two paragraphs):

1. A character called Tarantula settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, stares into it and sees the trees and vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle)
2. He makes a minute adjustment to the focus ring until the last remnant of blur is gone
3. He uses his handheld laser
4. He takes out a small weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)
5. He notes the data in a small notebook and calculates the solutions and dials those calculations into his rifle, then adjusts for windage
6. Then a few paragraphs later, he shuts out everything except for the scope, concentrating on the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, and… an aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket? Definitely sounds like something a real gun buff would write...

Also he seems to have taken information from a gun website basically verbatim:

* \[ [https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/](https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/) \] “The folding bipod is mounted onto upper rails (above the barrel), and the adjustable horizontal front grip is mounted on the lower rails (under the barrel). The rifle features fully adjustable buttstock and cheekpiece. \[…\] The barrel is protected by ventilated aluminum handguard and is fitted with muzzle brake (very useful when firing full-power magnum loads).”
* \[Tarantula, 43% of sample\] “The folding bipod was mounted onto upper rails above the barrel and the adjustable horizontal front grip was mounted on the lower rails, under the barrel. The rifle had an adjustable stock and cheekpiece. The barrel was protected by a ventilated aluminium hand guard and was fitted with a muzzle brake, useful when firing full-power magnum loads like this.”

I mean, is this what we’re calling research these days? Just dumping an encyclopedia article into your novel with minimal editing?

EDIT 8:

Fixed the part where I said he had sold 6 million books. Someone in the comments said the 6 million figure is for downloads which includes freebies, so the actual sales figure may be a bit different. His latest John Milton book which isn't out yet says ""Five Million Copies Sold"" on the cover, though that might just be for the John Milton series specifically. His site says, ""6 million books downloaded worldwide,"" not sold. Though his Twitter bio says ""over 6m copies sold worldwide,"" so it could be that his website just hasn't been updated as recently. I'm just going to be safe and say ""over 6 million downloads.""

Also, somebody noticed that in his newer books, Mark is using a new tactic:

* \[Never Let Me Down Again, 89% sample\] ""He opened Wikipedia and skimmed the details. It was a small resort on the coast with the locals relying on tourism to help them make their way. It was set on the edge of the Firth of Lorn, the bay reaching out in a horseshoe shape and shielded by the island of Kerrera and, beyond that, the larger Isle of Mull""
* \[Wikipedia article on Oban\] ""Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay forms a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull.""

All you have to do is have your character read Wikipedia in-universe so that you automatically cite your sources. Pretty good strategy, I must say. (This definitely isn't the most offensive of the evidence, I just found it funny that he just has his characters reading Wikipedia on their phones now.)

EDIT 9:

It looks like Mark Dawson has removed the Kindle version of Tarantula from Amazon, leaving only the Audible version up. He notably also did this with his novel The Black Mile, which some reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have accused of being extremely similar to LA Confidential.

I probably won't be updating this post too much, as I am pretty busy in my personal life, but I encourage people to share the information with newspapers and literary influencers and the like, and I'd also like to point out some common errors I see in articles being written on Substack and Medium:

1. Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years. (I take full responsibility for this one. Despite correcting this claim in my post, the thumbnail for this post still says it on other platforms, forever reminding me of my mistake. Ugh). Also, generally I'd say don't mention prolificness at all. It makes other prolific authors feel like you're insulting their craft.
2. Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement. Generally, don't mention 20BooksTo50K at all other than to say that he's a pretty well-connected, popular author who gets invited to guest speak at conferences. The group has a lot of fans who will defend it, and obviously saying he runs it when he doesn't isn't great for your case.
3. No conspiracy theories about ChatGPT. He wrote these books 10 years ago.
4. And obviously, no insulting self-publishing as a whole, or saying that any author who finds success is a sellout. For some reason, I see a lot of people doing this. When you write about a popular self-published author, you're going to attract people who are interested in the self-publishing space. Those people are not going to want to be told that most bestselling self-published books are worthless trash. That should be obvious.

So if you'd like to help spread the story, please try not to repeat any of the misinformation listed above. It weakens our case and makes it easy for someone to dismiss an entire article based on a singular factual mistake.

&#x200B;

EDIT 10: I got a private message from an anonymous source that I was able to verify with some more examples of pretty clear-cut plagiarism.

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: “The pistol shot was a muffled pop, flat and small and tiny in between the crumbling explosions. Charlie caught the muzzle flash of the second shot, a flare like a painted stripe across his white-streaked vision. He didn’t feel a thing. The bullet punched through his shoulder and blood started running down his upper arm. The muzzle flashed again and he felt stinging pain in his thigh.”

No Country For Old Men: “The pistolshot was just a muffled pop, flat and small in the dark quiet of the town. He turned in time to see the muzzleflash of the second shot faint but visible under the pink glow of the fifteen foot high neon hotel sign. He didnt feel anything. The bullet snapped at his shirt and blood started running down his upper arm and he was already at a dead run. With the next shot he felt a stinging pain in his side.”

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: “Charlie loped wincing along the kerb.”

No Country for Old Men: “He loped wincing down the sidewalk past the Aztec Theatre.”

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: “Charlie saw himself in a shop window that had somehow not been shattered by the blast. His right arm hung loosely at his side and he was limping like a cripple.”

No Country for Old Men: “He saw himself limping along in a storewindow across the street, holding his elbow to his side \[…\]”

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: “He dropped to the floor. Get up, he told himself. Get up. He’s not escaping. There’s no way. His arm flared white-hot with pain.	Ignore it. Get up. Charlie pushed himself to his feet. He crossed Savile Row with blood sloshing in his shoes.”

No Country for Old Men: “When he looked again he was sitting on the sidewalk. Get up you son of a bitch, he said. Dont you set there and die. You get the hell up. He crossed Ryan Street with blood sloshing in his boots.”

&#x200B;

The Black Mile by Mark Dawson: “There was the rich tang of gunpowder in the cool morning air. Like the smell of fireworks.”

No Country for Old Men: “A rich tang of gunpowder on the cool morning air. Like the smell of fireworks.“

&#x200B;

The Black Mile: “Charlie thumbed back the hammer and triggered a wide spread: buckshot sprayed.”

No Country for Old Men: “He spun with the shotgun and thumbed back the hammer and fired. The buckshot rattled off the second storey balustrade and took the glass out of some of the windows.”

&#x200B;

Also I found another comment on the accuracy, saying that “thumbing back the hammer only makes sense if there's a live round loaded but the gun's not cocked.“ When Mark Dawson plagiarized, he failed to make it so the gun had a spent round in the chamber. This is another example, like the I, Sniper example, that shows that Mark Dawson probably doesn’t research how guns actually work, but rather plagiarizes secondary sources without understanding the actual content of those sources.

&#x200B;

Obviously No Country for Old Men was written much earlier and is much more famous. Those first four excerpts are all from the same general section in the book as well. In fact, here’s the full excerpt from The Black Mile (172 words).

&#x200B;

If we take distance of time the book we waited for longest (because series ending books need to connect loose ends they tend to take longer) and apply that time to now  he would be 78.

This is the most Conservative estimate of at what age the 7th book were to be released. And this calculation disregards the fact that book 6 was not released.

I get it. I wouldn't want to write a book at 78 either. I am happy Martin gets to enjoy his old age."

Happy Birthday, and thank you, Dame Agatha.",14230,0.87,249,2019-09-16 00:55:08,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d4p5sp/agatha_christie_was_born_today_129_years_ago_8/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/d4p5sp/agatha_christie_was_born_today_129_years_ago_8/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"My first Christie was ‘Murder On The Orient Express.’

I was 11, and, early one morning, helping a friend and his family move into his new place. The previous tenants hadn’t cleared out everything, including this huge, stinking old mattress on the 1st floor (that’s the 2nd floor for people from civilisations that haven’t yet unlocked the metric system technology). We tossed the ugly thing out of the window.

And there, hidden for god knows how long  between the fetid foam and splintered bed slats, was this slim and sorry looking paperback.

At that point I already fancied myself a ‘mature’ reader of refined tastes, having ploughed through about 80 volumes of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries, and ready to complete another 60 over the summer break.

Honestly, I was glad to find an alternative. It was beginning to strike me that I was increasingly frequently being able to predict exactly what was gonna happen to Frank and Joe and Nancy. It was like those books were formulaic or something.

Around 10am my friend’s parents ran out of things to give me to do., so they fed me some KFC and turned in to nap.

No one was expecting me anywhere, so I found an empty hammock at the playground and began to read. I remember hoping I’d find a racy scene or two.

I didn’t move for the next eight hours. Sun was pretty much about to set, and my bladder was about to burst. I whizzed into a large drain and walked home in a bit of a stupor. I honestly can’t remember any earlier instance of having my mind well and truly fucked.

No one’s seen me in eight hours, so they were just about to start getting worried.  I don’t think I really listened to the chewing out I got.  At some point Mum told me to go bathe before dinner.  I remember them knocking on the bathroom door, asking me if I was getting married or something coz I’d been in there for 20 minutes. I hadn’t even soaped myself.

At dinner I’m still spaced out so Dad finally asks wtf  is wrong with me and where’d I’d been.  I asked him if he’s ever heard of someone called Agatha Christie.

He, Mum and Gran all ask why at the same time.

I tell him she’s an author, and I’d spend the day reading a novel she wrote, and that she’s got about sixty more, and that I was done with those dumb Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, and that she was the only author (other than Rowling) that I wanted to read anymore, and that it was the best book ever written, and that if they hadn’t read it then I was gonna make them, coz they didn’t know what they were missing out on, and then I went on to spell out and spoil the whole plot for them.

They politely wait for me to finish before they start sniggering. Gran tells me I’m obnoxious, and Mum’s starting to laugh her head off, and Dad takes me to the master bedroom, to the bookshelf he shares with mum (which up to this point I’ve entirely ignored because I’ve got my own bookshelf and it’s way more interesting), and tosses down five more Christies and says I can keep them.

I remember being amazed at the sheer coincidence that he’d have books by an author I stumbled across so randomly. It’d be a few more years before I realised that  the only one who’d outsold Christie was Bill Shakespeare, and that’s coz he had a 300 year headstart.

So it turns out Mom had been reading Christie since she was 16, Dad since 14, and Gran had been reading regional translated copies of Christie since she’d been 15 back in 1951.

Dad asked me to add the book I found to my library before I forgot. Way ahead of you, Dad, coz I just then realise I forgot it in the hammock.

Five minutes later I’m back at the hammock, nearly throwing up from sprinting on a full stomach. The book was gone. Not in the hammock, not near the drain, or at any point on the way home. Crushed, I was. Gran does her Gran thing and says that was probably what that copy’s fate or purpose was: to bounce from unwary reader to unwary reader to introduce them to Christie just like  it introduced me.

Yeah, nice story Gran, but fine, I’ll play.

I’m pretty sure I’m the only one of us who has read every single one of Christie’s murder mysteries though.

That was 19 years ago. Then, 8 years ago Christie served as the best wingwoman I ever had.

And earlier this morning my girlfriend and I were telling a mutual friend (who hadn’t read any of the books) what Christie meant to us. She seemed intrigued, and so my girlfriend and I are gonna buy her a book each. 

My girlfriend’s serving up ‘Death on the Nile’, and obviously, it’s ‘Murder On The Orient Express’ from me.

EDIT: Well, this became a thing overnight. What a wholesome and cool bunch you all are! Love you guys! Much gratitude for the gold, anon Redditor. 

A: Much gratitude for the many many engagement-to-be congrats. I guess this makes you guys the first to congratulate us, so you're all special to my gf and I now.

B: To those inspired by this post asking for Christie recommendations, check this list of my favourite dozen. If you like working up to the greatest stuff, read these in ascending order; read in descending order if you like starting with the greatest.

>Murder on the Orient Express 

>And Then There Were None

>Death on the Nile

>Evil Under the Sun

>Cards on the Table

>Nemesis

>Towards Zero 

>N or M?

>Appointment with Death

>A Murder Is Announced

>Taken at the Flood

>The A.B.C. Murders

C: To those saying this belongs on r/nobodyasked: Firstly, this was the only Christie-related post on Christie's birthday. Secondly, this subreddit isn't just about talking about books; it's also about how you relate to them. So the fact that this sub exists and we're all here... well... r/everyoneasked.

D: To those saying I'm a shit/obnoxious writer: I agree, if you're saying I'm have an incomplete sense of finesse or technique. But if you think writing well has nothing to do with creating a certain reminiscence-y mood or touching folks with the feels, then y'all don't know what you think you know it means to be a writer. Whatever. Beauty in the eyes of the beholder and all that.

E: For those asking for recommendations of writers 'Similar to Agatha Christie', there aren't any, but I've got two for you anyway. If Christie's 'hook' was **'Whodunnit?'** then these two authors had 'hooks' of their own:

> James Hadley Chase. His hook is ""What happens next?"" He did for general crime - robbery, kidnapping etc - what Christie did specifically for murder. Also, his stories are told from the criminal's POV.

> Erle Stanley Gardner's Perry Mason Series: His hook is ""GUILTY or *Innocent*?"" Dramatic courtroom pulp.  These are a bit of a guilty pleasure because they're most sensational and lurid things you'll ever read.

> Bonus: Sherlock Holmes, obviously, but I'd be amazed if people didn't know who that was."
as8h7z,I completed my challenge to read 50 books in 2018 and brought myself out of depression.

So, I started to challenge myself in various fields. One of my challenges was to read at least 50 books by the end of the year. I am happy to tell you that I finished that challenge along with my other challenges.

After completing the challenge I felt really confident and happy about myself and it also helped my get out of depression. Not that I don't get depressed now, but the condition is much better now.

#### Edit 1:

10 books I would really recommend:

-  1984
- Lolita
- Never Let Me Go
- The Old Man and the Sea
- Lord of the Rings Trilogy
- Animal Farm
- Lord of the Flies
- Gone with the Wind (It's not in this list, but I just read it in 2019)
- To the Lighthouse

#### Edit 2:

I chose most of my books from TIME magazine's list of top 100 novels of the century. Others were recommended to me by my professors or peers.


#### Edit 3:
Since many have asked about some other goals I have taken. Here's a list of my goals for this year, which is similar to last year.

One of my main objective for this year to learn to get consistent, for which I want work towards my goals everyday, and not in bursts.

Some of my goals for this year along with their daily targets are:

- To learn French good enough to read and speak with a bit of fluency by the end of the year. For that I am practicing it daily.

- Practice piano every day for at least an hour. Currently I am learning Claire de Lune, so, just want to finish learning it. Then record it and a piece by Chopin as soon as possible. As of now I haven't set my final goals for this year, just want to keep practicing.

- Read 60 to 70 novels by the end of the year for which I read a novel for at least an hour daily.

- Workout daily

#### Edit 4:

Many people seem to get an idea from my (bit misleading, which I can't edit now) title that I am now cured of depression. Which I already clarified in the post. To be clear, I still get depressed. But I have just found a way to not let it paralyze me like it used to earlier. I kept myself busy for the same reason. Hope this clarifies things a bit.

I don't claim that this is a cure for depression, I am just trying to learn how to live with it, and the thing is, it seems to work for me. People should learn to understand that what I have posted is an observation. What you interpret from it is left to you."

lon9u2,People who only read non fiction because “fiction is a waste of time” is the equivalent of a gym rat who skips leg day,14209,0.78,1161,2021-02-21 08:20:00,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lon9u2/people_who_only_read_non_fiction_because_fiction/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lon9u2/people_who_only_read_non_fiction_because_fiction/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I know a lot of people who will only read non fiction, mainly books that will equate to a more “successful” life. When I ask them what their favorite fiction novel is  a lot of people tell me they don’t read fiction because it’s a waste of time and they can use that time to learn more  by reading more non fiction.
 Now to be clear if you if read only non fiction because fiction doesn’t entertain you then that’s fine. But if you are reading books for the sole purpose of bettering yourself then I feel these people are really missing a big opportunity  by not reading fiction. 

For me personally I get facts from non fiction books and fiction helps me improve my empathy and abstract thinking. 

Would love to hear everyone’s take on this!

Edit: whoa I did not think this would get as much traction. I think my point is getting misconstrued. This isn’t a post judging  people on what they read. I’m talking about the logic some people use for not reading fiction. That some people only read the self helps, finance books because they are looking for a direct benefit in their life such as being more likable or having more money.
I’m just trying to show with this logic you can also get a direct benefit from reading fiction as well.

Like I said in my post if you are reading nonfiction solely because that’s what you like then more power to you!"

Typically I show love by reading people the book... as it was read to me by the first person I fell in love with. So, as a gift to him I recorded myself reading it so he could listen to it while he’s away. Only took 10 hours, one minute, and 45 seconds. 

Please don’t rat me out if I’ve broken copywriter laws! It’s not for profit!!!

EDIT: thanks for the awards! I shall sit on my pile of gold and silver like Smaug on his - and relish it for evermore!!

Now, to those of you who have seemed to take such an offence that I read a book to him that I was read by an old boyfriend. Sorry you’re miffed. But that was 25 years ago and I’ve read the book (or parts of it at least) to lots of people - including my own kid. The ex’s parents used to read it to he and his brother, he read it to me, I’ve read it to others, I hope my son will read it to people. It’s a nice book to have read to you - it’s not a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

And, for the record, this guy knows how much the book has figured in my life, and that I’ve read it to others as it was read to me. And it wasn’t an issue. I, in fact, started reading it to him as he fell asleep one night and that’s when I thought I should record it so he could take it with him. My friends who know about the little project want a copy too. It’s a sweet gesture, not an original or sacred one.

EDIT TWO: many of you are asking how I recorded myself - I downloaded the app “Dictaphone” to my iPhone (but I’m sure android has a similar version). It was a pretty easy app to navigate and I’m pretty low tech). I recorded it chapter by chapter - some were ~10 mins, others ~50. Then I uploaded the files to my google drive and put them on a flash drive which I’ll give to him before he goes. And I’ll tell him about all this hoopla. He’ll think it’s funny - and in some cases, unwarranted. 

I’d recommend if you want to try something similar to do a dry run with each chapter of whatever book you’re reading - I think that would have made me goof less as it would have been fresher in my mind and in how the words flow. Granted that would at least double the time it takes to do any project. 

EDIT THREE: he really loved it. He thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And he thought people who had issue with it were dead wrong."

So far my goal for the year is 12 books (as opposed to zero per year) and I'm already 4 books in. 😁

I'm going to be starting The Hobbit, followed by the Lord Of The Rings and then maybe read the first Dune book. I'm also reading, along with my fictional book of choice, non-fiction to scratch my itch to learn about various subjects.

Seriously, it's like a whole new world just opened up. My boring, depressing life just got a whole lot brighter. 😎

Sorry if this post is a little aimless. I'm just so excited to read.

Is there anyone else here that got into reading after adolescence?"

Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this:

American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.
The formatioin flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. 
It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again."""

>Exuberant breasts strained the fabric of the leotard.

-

>She stood facing me, flushed, breasts rising and falling distractingly.

-

> Mrs. Bancroft’s breasts jiggled with her steps under the thin material of the leotard, and I took a morose interest in the art on the other side of the corridor.

I know it's because the author is trying to portray the though process of the main character, who is obviously focused on this woman's breasts, but it struck me as kind of funny, like ""Then a pair of breasts walked into the room. A head located somewhere above and slightly behind the breasts started saying something or other, which caused the breasts to jiggle a little bit!""

I thought about it and I've noticed that Stephen King sometimes does this too. I remembered when I was reading *Pet Sematary*, thinking it was weird how he kind of randomly started talking about an old woman's breasts:

> It occurred to him that once she had been seventeen, her breasts eyed with great interest by the young men of the neighborhood, all her teeth her own...

Then I wondered how often he talked about breasts in *IT*, so I decided to take a look:

>He struggled halfway up, leaning toward it, and then felt one of Beverly's breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it.

-

>He stood there for a moment, staring at her as if he had never seen her before. In a way he never had. Her breasts heaved rapidly.

-

>And suddenly—maybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face, the contempt, maybe because she had called him a tub of guts, or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fell—the fear was suffocating him.

-

>It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last time—the belt he had used on her buttocks, her legs, her breasts.

-

>They are in bed together during this conversation. Her breasts are small like peaches, sweet like peaches.

-

>Her hands were folded just below her breasts, as if in prayer.

-

>She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts, fluttered her eyelashes rapidly, and then laughed.

This is where I got bored of this exercise and stopped looking - I was only 30% of the way through!!

So, has anyone else ever noticed this with any authors?

Edit: to the ~500 people who've said ""big surprise, men like boobs"", the point is that I like my characters to have depth. I want my female characters to be more than a pair of boobs walking around the room and I want my male characters to see female characters as more than a pair of boobs walking around the room."

However, the way that I've seen ""reading more"" being discussed, especially on the internet is...just not good. The advice that people give on ""how to read more"" is almost always terrible, such as speed ""reading"", audiobooks, skimming etc. And these are fine methods when, say, you have to go through a textbook for a test and you don't have enough time, but for reading in general, as an activity, it's just bad.

It's almost as if reading has become an intellectual status symbol in the society, and the more books you read, the smarter you are perceived to be. So the end goal is to just read as many books as you can, without regard to the enjoyment and the actual reading experience.

You'd never find a cinephile saying ""Yeah, I generally skip over some parts of film to get to the meat and like read the Wikipedia summary to help, that's just so that I can watch as many films as possible.""

People forget that at the end of the day, reading is a consumptive activity. Can it, in general, be more demanding than other consumptive activities like watching films and listening to music? Yes, absolutely. But it's still a consumptive activity, so applying the kind of strategy that one applies for doing productive work -- like how to study more, how to work more, how to practice more (an instrument, for example) is not good, in my opinion.

The best experience is to go through a book slowly. Read each and every line, and let it settle in your mind. If you like a sentence/para, or if you don't fully understand it read it twice, thrice. It's better to closely read one book per year than to skim over a hundred.

What do y'all think?

EDIT: With respect to my point about audiobooks (including some of the comments), I apologise. I realise I have been insensitive towards certain groups, and that I need to educate myself better on their experiences, the problems they face and evaluate my own privilege. I'm sorry."

It doesn't matter if it's a popular classic or if it's an underrated gem that feels like only you've read it, please just share with me the books you consider perfect and maybe a little reason why you think so. Feel free to post one book or multiple books.

For me, the books I consider perfect are Les Miserables, Don Quixote, Watership Down and The Iliad (there's bound to be more but for the time being these are the ones that pop into my head).

Les Miserables - it's tragic but also immensely life-affirming. You can't help but love Jean Valjean: for every wrong he does, he attempts to right it and throughout his life he sticks by that ethic even when it's the most difficult thing to do. There's so many characters that intertwine and interact with each other that it's hard not to fall for some of the relationships in this book too, especially Marius and Eponine. They're both clearly underdogs that were meant to be together but life just has its ways of complicating things.

Don Quixote - it's incredibly funny, with plenty of little jokes directly from Cervantes that criticises the author of an unauthorised sequel of Don Quixote that was published before Cervantes could finish the second volume of his novel. Don Quixote is both a fool and a genius. It's hard not to admire his constant determination to succeed even if his attempts are doomed to fail (the obvious example is the windmill charge but that's such a small segment of the large book: I loved the part where he confuses two flocks of sheep as two warring factions and decides to try and help both).

Watership Down - a beautiful look at environmental concerns, dictatorships, folklore and religion through the adventure of a group of rabbits in search of a new home. The adventure is full of intricacies such as stories of the great rabbit El-Ahrairah, the black rabbit of Inle, the social and gender roles of the rabbits, communication amongst different species, etc. Also that ending is going to stick with you. Very excited about the BBC series coming this December.

The Iliad - a little slow to start (but understandable as the ship catalog and soldier registry is almost like Homer's way of name-dropping the names of people in the audiences he used to orate to as well as their family members that were in the military) but once this beast of an epic poem gets going, it doesn't slow down. The violence is unflinching (two ways of tasting copper!) and it's full of Greek Gods throwing shade; soldiers' trash talking; interior politics and manipulation from both the soldiers and Gods; and an incredible tragedy (I won't spoil how the book ends for those unfamiliar with Greek mythology and The Iliad but even if you are aware of what happens, reading how it develops to that point in The Iliad is haunting and it still lingers with me a year after having read it).

TL;DR: which books do you consider perfect 10/10s? Not just the books you really like, but the books that don't seem to do any wrong at all!"

I sat down at the beginning of quarantine and finally started reading Fellowship very seriously, making sure I took it slow and read very closely. There were definitely parts of these books that I was more than a little bored throughout, but the parts that grabbed me REALLY grabbed me!

I had to take a good amount of breaks for a few weeks at a time, and once I even thought there was no way I was going to finish just cause it felt like way too big of a feat. So glad I pushed through cause the payoff was IMMENSE! I read the last 150 or so pages in one sitting which was so rare for me with these books. So happy I pushed through and took the time to read them, even with all the lulls I completely understand why they're held in such high regard, and everybody should give them a shot if they haven't!

Also, if you're struggling to get through a long book or series, it's totally okay - put the book down for a little bit, move on to something else, but come back to it. You'll find that a bit of a break is a really good refresher!

Edit: Should have said this, I have read The Hobbit probably 5 or 6 times since I was a kid and love it, I think it was a bit of a shock trying to read these expecting the same world from the same writer but having the writing style be so drastically different even though the world was familiar"

Be forewarned, only 49% of this post is sarcasm and, while I have no intention to offend, I also have no intention not to offend. 

Here it goes:

I opened up Goodreads for no particular reason. Just quietly scrolling and harming no one. I am on leave today and I can do whatever I like, and all I want to do is a little nothing. Tomorrow is public holiday here, so I’ve given myself a really long weekend. I figured I’d keep things peaceful. I expect that was too much to ask. 

I came across a book trending in the Thriller section - _The Moonlight Child_ by Karen McQuestion. It’s got a 4.22 rating and that’s quite high, in my estimation, especially for something that probably isn’t literary fiction or destined to be a classic. (But who knows? I haven’t read it, and I could be wildly mistaken.)

Rating aside, I was intrigued by the synopsis, so I read the reviews. Well. Of course I read the reviews. Reviews are vital. A public good, written (usually) by the best among us. A well-written review is invaluable, but reading through them is a dangerous business. 

See, sometimes reviewers are just parading around as Samaritans when they are much more akin to Satan. They remind us how easy it is for vicious psychopaths to review books on Goodreads. These people are the ones that publish reviews that contain spoilers without including spoiler warnings. There is a special place in hell for them. I truly worry for their friends and family. Villains.

Yesterday I spent most of the day finalizing my house and setting up my bookshelves before we went out to celebrate a friend's birthday. First editions, signed copies, and other books too old/sentimental to replace were placed just so.

When I get home, there are five firetrucks in our yard and half our house is gone. No one was hurt but I can't stop thinking about the years of enjoyment and love I had for each book. I wish I had gotten to read each one again.

Had to share this with someone and this sub knows how my heart hurts right now.

8ojp4y,A few lessons I've learned from reading 3 books about slave labor camps,13636,0.92,801,2018-06-05 00:06:39,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ojp4y/a_few_lessons_ive_learned_from_reading_3_books/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8ojp4y/a_few_lessons_ive_learned_from_reading_3_books/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"5) Humans Can Survive In Horrible Conditions

>“Like nearly all the camp inmates I was suffering from edema. My legs were so swollen and the skin on them so tightly stretched that I could scarcely bend my knees. I had to leave my shoes unlaced in order to make them fit my swollen feet. There would not have been space for socks even if I had had any. So my partly bare feet were always wet and my shoes always full of snow. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 27

The quote above comes from Viktor Frankl as he explains life at a Nazi concentration camp. He suffered from edema, which caused his tissues to swell up and made moving around torture. His feet were uncovered as he walked through snow and didn’t have a pair of socks–not that he could wear them anyway because his shoes were already tight due to his swollen feet. With barely any clothes or gear, he and others were still forced to mine the frozen ground for ten or more hours a day. 

The only nutrition prisoners were given was a bowl of very watery soup once daily and a small piece of bread. Sometimes they were given special extra allowances consisting of a piece of cheese or a slice of poor quality sausage. 
 
Life wasn’t much better for Alistair Urquhart at the Japanese labor camps. He was given only a cup of rice and water for each meal. From constantly working in the jungle with no shoes, he developed tropical ulcers. There was a doctor in his camp but he didn’t have any medicine so the best advice he gave Urquhart was to put maggots on his foot to eat the dead skin. 

As crazy as it sounds, it’s true:

>“I left the medical hut, shaking my head, still wondering if I were being had. Letting maggots eat my skin did not sound particularly appetizing but I was willing to try anything. I knew I had to stop the rot that was devouring my legs.” 

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 171

And the craziest part is it actually worked. However, Urquhart said that even years later he would sometimes get the sensation of maggots eating his skin. An unfortunate side effect, but he did live to be 97 years old. 
Alistair Urquhart, author of ""The Forgotten Highlander.""

&nbsp;


4) Survival Requires The Right Mindset 

>“‘It’s easy for these men to give up and when they lose hope the fight just seeps right out of them. On countless occasions I have seen two men with the same symptoms and same physical state, and one will die and one will make it. I can only put that down to sheer willpower.’ 

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 170 

Urquhart writes that he could tell which men would die by simply looking at their faces. Those with a lost gaze in their eyes didn't last long. It was in that moment that Urquhart made the decision that he would not stop fighting–even if it required him to put maggots on his feet to survive. 

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn learned a similar lesson. 

>“And the conclusion is: Survive to reach it! Survive! At any price!... This is the great fork of camp life. From this point the roads go to the right and to the left. One of them will rise and the other will descend. If you go to the right–you lose your life, and if you go to the left–you lose your conscience.  

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 302

Solzhenitsyn notes that prisoners had to make a decision, do whatever it takes to survive or fall short and die. This didn’t mean kill other people to survive, but rather it was a change in mindset. 

In his book, Solzhenitsyn writes that prisoners were allowed to take baths–with only cold water–but then had to endure a trip back to camp in subzero temperatures. Yet, none of them got pneumonia, in fact, they didn’t even catch a cold. 

However, when one of those prisoners was finally released and he could live in a warm home and take warm baths, he got ill the first month. The mindset of surviving at any price was not there anymore. Changing one's mindset can have an incredible impact on the rest of the body. 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of ""The Gulag Archipelago.""

&nbsp;

3) Slave Labor–You Get What You Pay For

>“We made constant attempts at sabotage. Men whispered orders to impair the construction of the bridge wherever possible. Some charged with making up concrete mixtures deliberately added too much sand or not enough, which would later have disastrous effects.  

— “The Forgotten Highlander” Pg 188

Evil leaders have been under the assumption that slave labor is a great way to accomplish projects at little to no costs, but this is far from the truth. As Urquhart writes in his book, the prisoners did everything in their power to delay or destroy the project. They even collected termites and white ants and deposited them into the grooves of the logs that were meant to hold up the bridge. As a result, construction projects were often delayed or if it were finished, the quality of the project was extremely poor and didn't last long.

A similar conclusion can be found in the Soviet labor camps.

>“All they were on the lookout for was ways to spoil their footgear–and not go out to work; how to wreck a crane, to buckle a wheel, to break a spade, to sink a pail–anything for a pretext to sit down and smoke.  

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 293

Just as in the Japanese camps, workers would constantly find ways to sabotage the project so they didn’t have to work. Solzhenitsyn adds that the material was so poor, people could break bricks with their bare hands. 

The prisoners did everything possible to quietly foil the project so that they wouldn’t have to work–after all, they weren’t being paid to work so they didn’t have any incentive to do so.

The prisoners were also constantly stealing project materials. Solzhenitsyn concludes the chapter by writing that the labor camps were not only ineffective, but they ended up costing the country more than if they had simply paid workers a fair wage. 

&nbsp; 

2) Life Is Unfair

>Viktor Frankl worked at a hospital as a psychiatrist, before being arrested and sent to four different concentration camps over the years.  
>Aleksander Solzhenitsyn was a decorated captain in the Soviet Army during World War II before he was arrested and sent to a labor camp for criticizing Stalin in private letters. 
>Alistair Urquhart was drafted into the army during WWII and shipped to the British outpost of Singapore before he was arrested by the Japanese and sent to one of their labor camps. 

 

None of these men were “evil” or actual criminals. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. None of them deserved to suffer in the labor camps. None of them should have worked 16 hours a day of physical labor on barely any food or water in horrific conditions.

Life is simply unfair at times. Viktor Frankl does, however, offer a piece of advice should anyone find themselves in a similar situation. He writes that everything can be taken from a person, except their attitude. 

>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms–to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way...It is this spiritual freedom–which cannot be taken away–that makes life meaningful and purposeful. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 66
Viktor Frankl, author of ""Man's Search for Meaning.""

&nbsp;

1) Man is Capable of being a Saint & a Swine

>“In the concentration camps...we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions. 

— “Man’s Search for Meaning” Pg 134

That is a heavy truth to swallow. Even in the concentration camps, Frankl noticed some prisoners gave their daily piece of bread to prisoners in dire need of nutrition. He also saw other miracles such as a Nazi doctor buying medical supplies with his own money and smuggling it back into camp to help the Jewish prisoners. 

Frankl ends the book by saying that man is capable of inventing the gas chambers of Auschwitz, but man is also the same being that entered those gas chambers with the Lord’s prayer on their lips. 

Solzhenitsyn came to a similar conclusion in his book.

>“Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either–but right through every human heart–and through all human hearts.   

— “The Gulag Archipelago” Pg 312

Solzhenitsyn spent countless hours thinking in prison–when he wasn’t being forced to work, prisoners sat in their cells and had nothing but their hands and their mind–and came upon the realization that good and evil exists inside every person, but they must make the decision within themselves. 

Inside every person is the struggle between good and evil, and although it is impossible to expel evil from the word, the next best thing is to constrict it within each person. That is a responsibility that falls upon each and every one of us.

A few weeks after my most recent attempt I was walking around in a book store and saw the Ray Bradbury quote ‘‘You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them. ’’ This got me thinking that it would be a terrible thing to leave my beloved books unread. I made a deal with my self that I could not attempt again until I read all my books. This transformed my life. It made it so that when ever I started working on plans to kill myself I would remember that I had so much reading to do, this would sometimes pull me out or at least take enough time for the feelings to dampen. When I was in better states I would buy more books to strengthen my safety net. It made when people gave me books even more special, because even though they don’t know, they are helping to keep me around a little bit longer. It makes it so I am productive even in my worst states (though it makes me all the more upset when my cognitive function is t good enough to read) and so that I have to get into a good enough state to read in order to get closer to killing myself which in turn makes me farther from doing so.  it’s the best coping mechanism I’ve used so far.

This line tells us so much. It tells us the relative ages of the two main characters, that they are not related, and that they are currently in a place where people don't know them (otherwise, why would everyone be wrong about their relationship?). This information then leads the reader to wonder why these two guys are away from their homes. What could have driven them out? Where is the family of the boy? Why would he travel without them? 

Almost immediately, this one line immerses the reader in a dark mystery that foreshadows a potentially evil ending. Simply amazing."

To assuage white guilt with stories that  promise to make them better people, while never threatening them, not  even with discomfort. They have no investment in our voices. Always, our  voices are  the first sacrifice at the altar of marketability."""

Something about being surrounded by the tangible evidence of the stories I love so much is beautiful and intoxicating, regardless of if I can read them that way.

I bought a signed copy of The Black Prism by Brent Weeks, and in the additional notes, I happened to mention that I'm blind. Reading has always been a reliably accessible interest.

His response was to not only sign my copy in print, but look into and successfully find a way to get the quote and signature in Braille.

I am blown away by and incredibly grateful for the thoughtfullness of a gesture that he did not need to make. I value the concept of the signed books I have, but I never imagined I'd be able to open one and truly experience it in the same way as sighted readers do.

I am so proud and grateful to be a reader. I hope so much that this is something that becomes more common.

Thank you for such an overwhelmingly supportive response. Please note that I do not mind questions about life as a blind person; I know it's hard not to be curious. :)"

Now that I have I'm wondering where it's been all my life, but also realizing that there's a lot of concepts and intelligent existential wit in it that I might not have caught onto if I had read it when I was younger. I haven't ever read anything that was simultaneously this witty, hilarious, intelligent, and original. In fact I haven't been able to put it down since I started the first book a week or two ago. It's honestly a bit difficult to put into words how brilliant this series is, in so many different ways - suffice it to say that if there was any piece of literature that captured my perspective and spirit, this is it.

I just finished the fourth book, which took all of Adam's charm and applied it to one of the most poignantly touching love stories I've ever read, and now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel like I've experienced everything I wanted life to offer me through the eyes of Arthur Dent, and now that I'm back in my own skin in my own vastly different and significantly more boring life I'm feeling a sense of loss. This is coming as a bit of a surprise since I wasn't expecting to find this kind of substance from these books. I had always imagined that they were just some silly, slap-stick humor type sci-fi books.

Besides ranting about the meaning these books have to me and my own sadness that the man who created them is no longer with us, I also wanted to create this post to ask you guys two things:

1) Should I read Mostly Harmless? The general consensus I've gotten is that it takes the beauty of the fourth book and takes it in a depressing direction, and I'd really much rather end this journey on the note it's on right now (as has been recommended to me more than a few times). But at the same time I want so badly to read more HHGttG. So I'm feeling a bit torn. Also, what about the 6th book that eion colfer wrote?

2) Are there any other books out there that come anywhere close to the psychedelic wit, hilarity, and spirit that this series has? I've heard dirk gently recommended more than a few times, and I'm about 1 or 2 chapters into it right now but it hasn't captivated me in the same way that HHGttG did. I'm going to continue on with it anyway though since Adams was behind it.

So long, Douglas Adams... and thanks for all the fish. :'(

Edit: Wow, wasn't expecting this to explode like this. I think it's gunna take me the next few years to get through my inbox lol. 

I've got enough recommendations in this thread to keep me reading for a couple lifetimes lol - but Pratchett, Gaiman, and Vonnegut are definitely the most common ones, so I'll definitely be digging into that content. And there's about as many people vehemently stating that I shouldn't read mostly harmless as there are saying that I should. Still a bit unsure about it but I'm thinking I'll give it a bit of time to let the beauty of the first four books fade into my memory and then come back and check it out. 

Thanks for the reviews and recommendations everybody! "

But it's very hard to say just what we learned, how we were changed."" - Ursula Le Guin


It is from an introduction she wrote for The Left Hand of Darkness which i just started reading, and this quote really resonated with me. I've been reading books since i could read, and my favorite ones are sci-fi. What she wrote is exactly how i feel about every book i read, i just could never put it into such beautiful words like she did. 


The link to the whole introduction, definitely worth the read:

I read constantly, everything and fast. If my parents wanted to punish me, they took my books away. I read in the car, under my school books, in the bathroom, under the covers, at parties. Books were such a central part of my life until I was in my 20s, when slowly but surely, I lost the ability to focus on anything but rereading a few favourites.

Maybe the combination of smartphones, social media and kids did it, but suddenly I'd rather do anything but read. I would read a couple things on vacation, and that was about it. I felt so guilty about it (and weird - to go from being an objectively well-read young adult to a mindless FB scrolling adult), but I just didn't have the stamina or interest to consume new books.

Finally, I downloaded the Libby app. It was my daughter that inspired me to get it set up, because I was getting concerned about her screen time and how much less she read than myself as a kid, but also because she's dyslexic and audiobooks are a much better media for her. So we both started using the app and IT. CHANGED. MY. LIFE.

I have already read 48 books since the new year. I have read non-fiction, new fiction, reread books I haven't thought of in years, classics that I ""read"" in university, all the books that I have heard about but somehow never got around to. Someone mentions a book to me, I can find it and borrow it right away. The library doesn't have a book, I can place a hold and it shows up automatically a few days later. I can even have two libraries (my current city library has a smaller English collection, so I added my hometown's library). I can suggest the library buy books! I can try a book I'd never have bothered to buy, and return it in an instant if I'm not interested. As an easily distracted, disorganized person who regularly racked up huge late fees, all the guilt and frustration associated with borrowing and returning books is gone.

Libby made it possible for me to deal with my internet addiction and stick to a social media diet. I can read in bed again without waking my spouse, or listen to audio books. It's even helped me go to the physical library more often, when I read a book on the app that I realize would be excellent in physical form. It sounds crazy, but I'm sleeping better, I'm happier, and overall just feeling like a real human being with a brain.

&#x200B;

So, if you are a disheartened formerly voracious reader and you haven't tried it (or whatever the library app in your area is), give it a shot."

A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric. “Of course, Mr. Dresden. I’m sure we can do business.” The look she gave me was direct, sensual, and willing."" 

Every single woman is portrayed exactly like this and I think it represents the worst in Urban Fantasy.

Edit:  For all the people saying she's a a supernatural fae or something this is Lydia from Grave Peril. She's a seer who gets possessed by the end of the book but during this she's a human."

ahfcxf,When I replaced social media with reading,12917,0.93,541,2019-01-19 03:11:11,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ahfcxf/when_i_replaced_social_media_with_reading/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ahfcxf/when_i_replaced_social_media_with_reading/,self.books,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"A couple years ago I discovered my library has an ebook app I can download onto my phone.  So, as an experiment, I moved my Facebook app and put the ebook app in its place.  I normally used the Facebook app when doing things like waiting in the lunch line or at the bus stop or something.  I told myself that from there on out, I would read during those times instead of browsing social media.  The results were more telling than I expected.  Here's what I noticed:

1. I had been checking social media so often that it had become a muscle memory.  For the first few days, I would constantly reach into my pocket, pull out my phone, and open the app, all without realizing.  And then I would be startled to see a sea of words instead of Facebook.  Because I guess reading is something that calls for actual attention, which I wasn't prepared to give during those times.  But I had no idea how habitually I was checking Facebook until I was doing this.
2. I went to a presentation about criminal justice reform.  When it was getting wrapped up and conclusions were being said, I got bored, and was about to reach for my phone.  But then I thought: if I had a clunky book with me, would I pull it out and start reading it right then?  No, because that would be rude.  Cell phones seem like they're less rude because I COULD be doing something important, like answering an urgent text.  But is being rude OK as long as you're disguising it well?  Hmmm.... 
3. I found myself reading a lot more.  Finishing a lot more books.  Which is great!  Except, it means that I had previously been reading actual books worth of social media on a regular basis.  I find this disturbing to think about.
4. I came to like ebooks!  They're much easier for reading on-the-go, and since I'm using my library's app I can support the library without having to make the trip down there.

I hope I'm not coming off as some old guy who thinks that phones and social media are evil.  I still use social media regularly, including the apps, but this experiment shed some light on problematic habits I'd formed and how I can use this technology more wisely.  "

Thanks for all the encouraging words (and awards). Cell data comes and goes here so I'll be checking the thread here and there answering whenever I can. It's really nice to talk about this stuff though because I'm pretty much the only serious reader up here lol

A little background first: In early 2021 my life kind of fell apart very quickly. I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown.

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I really just wanted to isolate myself, lose myself in some good books, and recalibrate my mental state after all the shit that went down. The last 12-13 months have basically just been work, read and hike/camp among the beautiful northern landscapes the lodge was located in.

I managed to read close to 40 books in that timeframe, and I wanted to share my thoughts on them with the sub as reading, more than anything, helped me center myself and get some perspective on my life. I read across a variety of genres and have ranked them with a little mini-review below, from worst to best. I didn't do an overall ranking, but rather ranked the books I read within their specific genres/categories.

**Classics/Literary Fiction:**

8. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: Honestly, this book kind of irritated me in how transparent it was at being shamelessly emotionally manipulative. It was certainly very well-written, but I found Jude just unbelievably stupid as a character and after a certain point in the story, found myself losing any kind of empathy towards him. The rest of the characters are fairly non-descript. The book is kind of morbidly fun to see just how over the top the misery porn can get though, but I hesitate to actually call it “good”

7. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway: I’m starting to think that Hemingway might just not be for me. I’ve read The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises previously, and found them “just okay”. That was my prevailing sentiment towards AFtA as well. I do like Hemingway’s terse, succinct style, but in this one, I felt it actually kind of worked against him because it makes both the war setting and central relationship feel a bit flat. But the worse thing about the book is the character of Catherine. Jesus christ, she is annoying. Just an insipid, silly character. I did like the downbeat, depressing ending though

6. A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this book throughout the first couple hundred pages. It’s dense, slow and filled with a shit ton of what fills like unimportant minutiae. But it eventually comes together, and the slow buildup really manages to create an epic scope and magnitude that are unlike anything else I’ve read from old Charles. It’s a story that demands concentration and attention, and by the final, powerful third act, it’s well worth it.

5. East of Eden by John Steinbeck: An epic, multi-generational family saga, East of Eden is a work that for me works masterfully on both an epic and an personal scale. It’s hard to encompass everything this story does so well in a short review. It’s both a biblical, mythical retelling as well as an intimate character study punctuated with some best-in-class writing. It makes the Salinas Valley into a living, breathing entity of its own, with these macro and micro tales of good and evil spanning its expanse. Also, fuck Cathy Ames. All my homies hate Cathy Ames

4. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: This is my first encounter with Woolf, and it solidified for me that I will be coming back to her body of work multiple times. It was definitely a bit of a struggle getting into it, as you’re jusyt thrown into the deep end with Woolf’s abstract prose and stream of consciousness style. But once you grab hold of what Woolf is trying to do, it becomes a beautifully melancholic story with a pastoral feel that nonetheless manages to really capture a huge gamut of human emotions and perspectives

3. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: Horrifically beautiful. It’s fairly challenging to start, but once you start vibing with McCarthy’s style and writing, the narrative just completely immerses you into it. It’s like a surreal, fever-dream, gruesomely violent vision of the Wild West with gorgeous depictions of the landscape, brilliantly written dialogue and prose that begs to be read over and over, and the most unforgettable villain I’ve come across in literature. This is a novel I can see myself going back to time and time again

2. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I was flip-flopping between this one and Middlemarch as the #1 book in the classics/literature category but it’s very close. This book is, on the surface, “just” a murder-mystery but in actuality is a dense, complex philosophical exploration of various facets of life. This is a masterpiece of character development as we see ideas of free will, morality and family told through multiple different lenses. It’s also a bit of a treatise on religion and the meaning of faith. In short, it’s a *lot* and there’s probably a ton that I didn’t even get in one read-through. Nevertheless, it’s an epic tale that I found both illuminating and entertaining

1. Middlemarch by George Eliot: A wonderful, atmospheric slow burn, and might be one of the best books I’ve ever read. Honestly probably in my top 5 of all time. I found it to be such an all-encompassing look at the things that make us human, and feels both incredibly personal and universal at the same time (kind of like East of Eden). It’s a story about marriage (hit me particularly close to hom) and about sacrifice, with masterfully sketched characters and an exploration of life in era to the minutest details. “Immersive” is a word that gets thrown around a lot for books but that’s what Middlemarch truly is – a totally lived in feeling of a small, nowhere English town a couple of hundred years ago. I found it unforgettable

**Historical Fiction:**

5. Shogun by James Clavell: This is a huge, huge novel, both in its page count, as well as the scope of the story and the characters. Historically speaking, it did seem a little mythologized and perhaps overly romanticizing of the whole samurai/warrior culture, and the main protagonist is a bit of a bland nothing white male fantasy. Clavell’s prose is also merely workmanlike. But as an entertaining story, it fares much better, and is actually very well-paced for something that’s almost 1200 pages.

4. Hawaii by James Michener: This is my first book written by Michener, and I can see why he came to be seen as the godfather of historical fiction. This, like Shogun, is an absolute unit of a book, and although it’s plenty flawed, I came away from it with something close to awe just based on the sheer scope of the timeframe that Michener captures here. the formation of Hawaii in the first chapter is some of the best storytelling I read in the past year. However, this is a book that gets progressively less interesting as it goes and moves into the “present” time, and the characters are little more than pawns. Still recommended though especially if you find Hawaii interesting

3. Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel: Once I figured out that everytime this book uses “he” (which is a LOT), it’s almost always referring to the main character Thomas Cromwell, I started to enjoy it a lot more. It’s really eloquently written and Cromwell is a brilliantly developed character. It’s a story that requires a lot of focus but to me it eventually paid off, and the narrative really carries you along once you get used to Mantel’s idiosyncrasies.

2. I, Claudius by Robert Graves: well-written, funny and hugely informative. Really a slow burn character study of the eponymous Claudius, and the compulsively entertaining look at the back-door dealings and family conflicts of that era in Rome. I thought it also did a pretty great job at exploring the thirst of power and the excesses certain people are willing to go to achieve it. Just a great, multifaceted read overall.

1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry: This book is seriously a contender for one of my top 10 favourites of all time. To begin with, the two main protagonists are just incredibly written and developed, and the attachment you have towards them carries you through to the monumental length of the narrative. It’s an emotionally powerful story with an excellent main plot and smaller side stories that are all great in their own right. Just a truly epic tale told by a master storyteller

**Science Fiction:**

6. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline: I imagine I would have probably liked this book if I was still in high school, crammed as it is full of video game power fantasies and endless pop culture references. But good god, actually reading it as an adult was a painful experience. Other than being a compendium of 80s homages, it fails spectacularly on almost every level. Bad writing, bad characters, tedious, dull storytelling. It’s frankly just awful

5. Foundation by Isaac Asimov: Look, I know this is a foundational (hehe) “canon” text in the sf genre, but I just found it to have too many issues to truly enjoy. The concepts and ideas are great – eye-opening and fascinating – but for me, the book fell flat in almost every other area. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, the writing style is about as wooden as it gets, and the book is very much of its time (i.e. dated af) when it comes to women. Really, this is just a collection of scenes with characters sitting in rooms and talking. Dynamic storytelling it is not, despite the interesting concepts

4. Dune by Frank Herbert: I don’t know if this will be unpopular or not, but I honestly thought Dune was just…ok. I watched and loved the movie, and decided to jump into the book afterwards. While I do appreciate the worldbuilding that went into it – as well as the often weird, surreal 60s drugged-out atmosphere – as a piece of storytelling I feel like Dune has been improved upon over the years. I still respected it as a forerunner of so many different kinds of sff stories we have these days, but taken on its own merits I found it to be interesting but rather turgid on the whole

3. Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: I can’t imagine a more definitive fictional story about Mars than this one. The amount of thoughtful research and extrapolation of science, technology, politics and society that has gone into this novel is simply phenomenal. It honest to god at times reads like an instruction manual for the first Mars colonists, whenever we end up getting there. That does work to the novel’s detriment at times though, as it can feel a bit dry and overly technical at parts. But I still found it to be a grand, immersive read, and the somewhat boring parts were more than compensated for by the overall sweep of the story and the author’s incredible vision of a Martian future for humanity

2. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin: Complex, thoughtful and human. This isn’t the first Le Guin book that will appear on this list either. This book is the best depiction of a realistic utopia I’ve ever seen in fiction, and it does what the best sf does and presents a fascinating “what-if” look at a cool concept. Unlike a lot of sf, it succeeds hugely in two other areas. The first is creating a fully-realized central character – Shevek is an awesome protagonist with a lot of depth and nuance. The second is Le Guin’s inimitable prose, which is elegant and beautiful while still somehow managing to be simple and concise

1.Hyperion by Dan Simmons: This might be the best sf novel I’ve ever read. It’s the rare sf story (imo) that is both excellent from both a literary and “entertainment” perspective. It’s just crammed full of cool ideas and concepts, and I loved the Canterbury Tales-esque structure, which leads to the book’s greatest asset – the characters. I found each “pilgrim” to be fascinating and well-developed, and their respective stories were beautifully told, ranging from thrilling, scary, funny to downright haunting and tragic. The Priest’s Tale and the Scholar’s Tale have both been etched in my mind since I read them. This book is an incredible achievement and to me a high-water mark for the speculative fiction genre

**Horror:**

5. The Troop by Nick Cutter: Not much to say about this one. It’s a pulpy, B-movie-esque story without much in the way of characterization, prose or depth. But it does disgusting body horror better than almost any other horror novel I’ve ever read. Some of the scenes are downright grotesque and repulsive, and I have a high tolerance for that kind of stuff. It’s a quick, easy read and but not particularly memorable outside of the gross-out factor

4. The Elementals by Michael McDowell: A fun, atmospheric and really well written Southern Gothic horror story. This book is akin to Haunting of Hill House in that it deals in subtlety and a sense of creeping doom. It’s a definitely slow burn but that really helps it in building a stifling sense of gloom and dread. The characters are fascinating and it really is very well-written. Highly recommended if you like horror novels focused more on atmosphere than gore/jump scares

3. The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories/The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories by HP Lovecraft: I’m combining these two collections into one as they’re essentially just one big compendium. After reading these, I’ve become a huge Lovecraft fan. I’m aware of his racism and xenophobia but I believe in separating the art from the artist to a certain degree. Anyway, I thought these stories were mostly pretty awesome. I actually love Lovecraft’s verbose, overwrought prose – it really gives the stories a certain level of operatic, melodramatic ambiance. Some of the Dunsany-inspired stories are downright gorgeous. The mythos is fascinating and in the best stories – At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Colour out of Space etc. – he reaches a kind of dark, horrific grandeur. Reading these in the remote northern landscape was truly a fantastic experience

2. The Books of Blood by Clive Barker: Dark, horrific, visceral, erotic – this is an incredible collection of horror short stories. Barker is a hell of a writer – a few levels above most in this genre, and he has a uniquely twisted and dark imagination obsessed with the human body, and in particular, sexuality, and how the body can be a battleground of all sorts of horrors, physical or otherwise. Some of them also have a dreamlike, surreal feel to them. In particular, I was blown away by “In the Hills, the Cities” – it’s a story unlike any I’ve ever read before, mind-boggling, bizarre and haunting. Also of note are “The Midnight Meat Train”, “Rawhide Rex” and “Dread”, but honestly they are all pretty damn great even at their weakest

1.The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson: The amazing show led me to the book, and although the source material is almost completely different other than sharing some names with the characters from the show, it’s an incredible story in its own right. Jackson’s prose is probably the best I’ve come across in this genre, and her ability to create atmosphere and mood is without peer. The setting just feels alive in all its creepy, gothic glory. It’s a fairly small, intimate story but a very powerful, often gut-wrenching one in how it captures the main character’s very human flaws and insecurities. In the end, it leaves us pondering about what’s more terrifying – a seemingly haunted house full of ghosts or the doubts and self-loathing in our own hearts?

**Non-Fiction:**

5. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari: Yeah…I wasn’t really feeling this one. I understand why it’s popular and it did start off very well. But the vast majority of the book is just too full of speculation and the author’s own musings without much in the way of concrete evidence. I also found his mythologizing of hunting and gathering and seeming dislike of the agricultural revolution strange and misguided. The whole book just felt a mile wide and inch deep. Superficial, surface-level exploration without any true insight or in-depth analysis of a complex topic

4. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain: Wow, if ever there was a non-fiction book tailor-made for Reddit, this is it lol. I have to admit, this book did come to me at the perfect time, as I was in a pretty closed-off, solitary mood after making my big move. I liked it well enough, and the insight into analyzing introvert behaviour was fairly interesting. But honestly, for the most part, this book just felt like it was preaching to the choir, about how awesome and helpful introversion is. It tends to conflate a lot of psychological aspects and concepts with a generalized sweep without really delving deep into them. Ultimately, it really feels like a narrative that’s just self-affirmation for introverts. Which I guess is not all bad

3. The Ancestor’s Tale by Richard Dawkins: I’ve always been a huge fan of Dawkins and evolutionary science in general, and this book to me, is his masterwork. It’s painstakingly detailed look at 4 billion years of evolution through certain ancestors that’s structured like the Canterbury Tales. It’s a little different from Dawkins’ other books in that it’s a bit more technical and maybe not as friendly to the layperson – and also missing his trademark snark and cynicism (whether that’s a good thing is up to the read). But it’s incredibly enlightening and informative, and even eye-opening.

2. The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg: If you have any interest in astronomy and cosmology at all, then this book is a must-read. It’s fairly old, written near the end of the 70s, but aside from missing the discovery of dark matter, it’s still very much relevant and probably the best encapsulation of the big bang and the beginning of our universe you can find. It straddles the line perfectly between being appropriate for a casual reader and someone more academic

1. Endurance by Alfred Lansing: Boy did I pick the perfect book to read while living in a cold, remote landscape. Endurance is without a doubt one of the most thrilling, intense stories of survival I’ve ever read. You come away with awe and respect at not only the courage, determination and perseverance of these men, but also at the sheer unfeeling power of nature itself. Some of the events and twists are so crazy that it feels like the contrivances of a Hollywood director – in the best way possible. Lansing captures everything with some truly mind-boggling amount of research from primary sources, and creates an incredibly entertaining – and scary - narrative

**Fantasy:**

6. The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan: This was the only DNF book for me out of my entire list. I had read Eye of the World and The Great Hunt before, and I did a quick summary read-through of those two books to catch me up on the third book. I remember finding the first two books flawed even when reading them as a teenager but tried to give the series another shot. It’s a no go, to be honest. I just can’t over how weirdly juvenile and archaic all the characters and their interactions are. It borders on being cringeworthy and Jordan’s understanding and writing of female characters is just baffling. The plot just seems like more of the same. Bad guy of the week needs to be stopped by motley crew of magically powered teenagers. I’m calling it quits on Wheel of Time for good

5. Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson: I read the first book of Stormlight a few years back and thought it was alright. Have seen rave reviews of WoR and decided to give it a shot and honestly came away really underwhelmed. There are some cool ideas for worldbuilding here but I don’t really find Sanderson to be a good writer at all. Aside from the wooden prose, the characters just come off as shallow, fantasy archetypes and the plot is both convoluted and nonsensical at the same time. Too much time is spent on explaining how powers and magic works – which I also found to be an issue with the first book. I can see the appeal of these books for younger readers as they basically are like spectacle-filled action movies, but they are not for me

4. Red Rising/Golden Sun by Pierce Brown: I read these back to back because they’re fairly quick, easy reads. These are essentially mindless action movies in book form and they were a pretty nice change of pace as I needed something lighter after Wolf Hall. The character is a total Gary Stu, the dialogue is ridiculous and the story is crazy over the top. But yeah, it’s pretty fun, can’t deny that

3. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susannah Clarke: Man, this book might have taken me the longest out of everything I read in the past year, and there were times when I was contemplating dropping it. I’m glad I persevered though because I eventually came to love it. It’s essentially a Victorian novel, written in that era’s style with almost scary accuracy, and a fantasy novel-of-manners. Once you get on its wavelength, you start to appreciate the writing and the beautifully immersive world with some fascinating characters. The footnotes are amazing and the slow burn really helps create a wonderful atmosphere that carries you through to the end

2. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin: Man, Le Guin is on her way to becoming one of my favourite authors. This little book is beautiful and punches far above its weight in terms of ratio of size to content. It’s a small little thing, especially compared to a lot of the bloated doorstoppers common to the genre but for me, it contained more emotion and wisdom than 10 Jordans or Sandersons. Written in Le Guin’s clear yet elegant prose, it has a fairy-tale-esque melancholy atmosphere, as if it’s a story you’re being told in front of a fireplace by your grandfather or something. It’s a story of self-discovery and learning to accept the dark parts of yourself, all brilliantly written. Will be continuing with the rest of the series eventually

1. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe: Preface – I only read Shadow and Claw so far but holy shit. What a book. Mysterious, mystical, weird, beautiful and often frustrating – BotNS is unlike any fantasy I’ve ever read. It probably has the most gorgeous prose I’ve ever come across in the genre, and the usage of allegory and metaphor was really well done. The strange, dreamlike, almost surreal ambiance is what really stood out to me, and despite the obfuscations of the plot and the language, this still makes the book easy to get lost in

That’s it for my reviews/analysis! Let me know what you guys think of these books. I’m in the process of going through another batch of stories and may post another review thread in a year or so lol"

I can’t help but add the very first book that started the frenzy off. The story of a young girl who defected from North Korea was so riveting, I finished it in three days. She had a TED talk as well for those who are interested. 


**The Book Thief** by Markus Zusak

The WW2 era always fascinated me, and the story of a young girl in Nazi Germany shows a side to the war us Americans rarely see. Tragedy, love, and a passion for reading kept me entangled for too many late nights on this one.


**The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers

I really should include all three of her “Wayfarer” series in this, as well as her latest fourth book. This was a Reddit Book Club section that I enjoyed SO much, I immediately bought the remaining two: “A Closed and Common Orbit” and “Record of a Spaceborn Few”. Chambers has a way of writing such believable science fiction without sounding dull or over the top. I wish she had more novels out.


**A Thousand Splendid Suns** and **Kite Runner** by Khaled Hosseini 

Both of Hosseini’s books take place in the tumultuous Middle East during times of peace and then times of conflict. The contrast between both time frames and how it affected the characters pulled some big ugly tears from me a few times. He writes with such depth I found myself ordering “And The Mountains Echoed” to read next.


**Where the Crawdads Sing** by Delia Owens

Don’t judge a book by its cover and don’t assume a “swamp rat” is just that. I was recommended this one and I’ve learned to listen to my friends; they clearly know what I will enjoy. Every recommendation I chose to read I was thoroughly entertained. 


**Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah

If you think Trevor Noah is funny in his stand-up comedy, you will laugh at his childhood memoir about growing up in South Africa. Definitely had me chuckling out loud.


**The Goldfinch** by Donna Tartt

I did not expect this to be such a long book. When it showed up at my door I wondered what I got myself into. The first few chapters I still thought I was crazy. But I have a rule: get halfway through at least before you give up. I maybe got a half dozen chapters in before I knew I’d never give it up. I’ve been told the movie was less than entertaining however so I probably will skip it. 


**The Huntress** by Kate Quinn

Another one recommended by a friend and sure enough I stayed awake far too late some nights because I couldn’t put this down. Told from the point of view of each of the main characters, the intertwining as it progresses is a style I’ve found I enjoy very much. I’m told Quinn’s other book “The Alice Network” is also one I need to read.


**Entire Harry Potter Series** by JK Rowling

I spent well over a decade refusing to read Harry Potter or watch any of the movies. I resisted purely because it was so trendy. I’m not a “rebel” or anything, I just didn’t want to get caught up in SUCH a strong craze. Well now I know WHY it was so immensely popular. Oh and yes, now I have seen the movies as well :)


EDIT: thank you so much for the support and for the shiny metal! This sub has been so informative and I’m so grateful for all the books it has led me to read. You all rock!

EDIT 2: lots of people have asked

1) How could I go so long without reading?! After high school life just got in the way and my time management was poor back then. I wish I had books as a refuge for some dark times though, and I hope anyone trying to get back into reading is successful.

2) How do I stay so focused or read so quickly? I used to wander off in thought a lot and it got worse and my list of worries grew as an adult. Now, I sit with the audio version as well as the physical book and it keeps me focused. 

3) Do I buy brand new books, used, library etc? I love the feel of real books. But this can be more expensive than an electronic reader for sure. Thrift stores, garage sales, used book sales, and Amazon have been my saving grace. I found my entire hard cover Harry Potter set at a thrift store in fact. Took a few trips to get it all but at $3 a book it was worth it.

PLEASE keep the recommendations coming!! Of all the books I chose to read this year maybe five were of my own choosing. Most were from Reddit, friends, family, and various articles online. You people have opened my eyes to some incredible books!"
bt693r,I’ve finished The Name of the Wind and I am blown away,12846,0.89,2372,2019-05-26 15:34:08,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bt693r/ive_finished_the_name_of_the_wind_and_i_am_blown/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bt693r/ive_finished_the_name_of_the_wind_and_i_am_blown/,self.books,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss is the single best book I’ve read in a long, long time. If there was ever a book that held me so captivated for so long before, I certainly don’t remember. Rothfuss certainly has a way with words especially when establishing atmosphere and ambiance. His world is rife with character and depth and is as lively as our own, as well as adorably tongue-in-cheek at times. Each character I feel like I know on a personal level. I had legitimate difficulty putting this book down and that has not happened in at least ten years. 

One of my favorite things about this series is that there’s a sort of science to the magic the characters create, which called sympathy. This lets you more or less deduce how things take effect and sort of tally what’s happening magically, something I don’t think a lot of fantasy books have, in my experience. Rothfuss meshes magic with actual established science and reason making it just that much more believable.

Truth be told I’m nearly halfway through Wise Man’s Fear, the second book, and it’s just as great for further establishing the world at large. I anxiously await the third book, however I’m not really in any rush. Rothfuss should take all the time he needs to make everything just right. thankfully I have the rest of book two to tide me over until then. There’s an accompanying book to go with them that I will undoubtedly read as well because I can’t get enough! I cannot speak enough praise of the Name of the Wind.

EDIT: Hi, Front Page! Holy shit this exploded! i'll get to comments as i am able, but i'm not sure. i might have to fake my own death or something. maybe open an inn in some backwater town...

EDIT 2: can we get an 'upvote all responses' button? plz and thanx.

EDIT 3: Kingkiller seems to be a love/hate series, which is all well and good, but y’all need to stop judging people by what they read, ffs.

EDIT 4: just wanted to say that i am thrilled this post received so much traction and i'm elated that the grand majority love this series as much as i do. now, collectively, we play the waiting game. thanks so much for bringing me to the front page!!

EDIT 5 & 6: with regard to Rothfuss “taking so long” to write the third book, I learned after posting this that the dudes parents died while writing these books. So, lay the fuck off him and  let the man write in peace! This is why I say that he can take all the time he needs. How fucking hard is it to wait for something anyhow?! You’re doing literally nothing!

Holy shit!! Gold and PLATINUM!! thanks so much!!"

Sometime last month I saw a post from this subreddit on the popular screen talking about how they only watched the Lord of the Rings movies and how the books vastly expanded the story. So I thought, why not, I love fantasy books and decided I would start from the beginning of the series when I could. Jump to last week, my wife and I head to B&N and pick up a few books. I headed straight to the sci-fi and fantasy section as usual and found the LOTR section. I picked up a copy of the Silmarillion among a few other books and headed out (obviously stopping by the board game selection before leaving).

Jump to 3 nights ago, I was sitting in bed reading and my wife was saying she was having a really tough time going to sleep and I said I could read to her. As a note, my wife doesn't prefer the time dedicated to world building that I enjoy, which is basically all of the Silmarillion for as far as I've gotten. So I started reading to her and about a chapter later she was out like a light.

So for the last couple of nights, our night time procedure has been to get ready for bed then for her to tell me to grab the book and start reading and I've got to say... It is an awesome feeling.  I plan to only read it before bed so I can make this last as long as possible."

131wux4,I'm so tired of authors describing skin like mine with chocolate or mocha. How would you like it if every time a character who looks like you is introduced they get compared to mayonnaise?,12508,0.58,2073,2023-04-28 20:48:13,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/131wux4/im_so_tired_of_authors_describing_skin_like_mine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/131wux4/im_so_tired_of_authors_describing_skin_like_mine/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"If I see one more chocolate, mocha, caramel in a character description I'm going to scream. Like at this point if you're doing it it has to be on purpose. It annoys me because we'll get character descriptions like:

""The detective was a portly fellow. His face was marked with pot marks that betrayed his age that his jet black toupee was trying to hide. He rubbed the stubble on his face as he looked over the cold case."" 

""As I scanned the classroom I saw numerous kids at various levels of interest. Jen was one of the kids who was at level zero. Head down and covered by her brunette hair. Her skinny frame looked as if it was getting swallowed by the oversized desk. I went to wake her up.""

""Jackson was a man that took care of his body. He worked out twice a day. He had clear smooth skin that a blemish wouldn't dare to sabotage. His only flaw was that he was balding. After growing out his beard he made the big decision to cut all of the hair on his head off. ""

Which are cool they give you a quick sense of the character and let you easily formulate a mental picture of the character. And then we'll get descriptions like:

""Ebony was a mocha chocolate queen. Her caramel and cream complexion would have stopped any person in their tracks. Her gold hoop earrings swayed like her hips as she walked towards me."" 

Like BRUHHHHHH. 



All these examples above don't mention race. They could technically be anyone. But it's like they are explicitly saying when someone is black, in a cliché way at that. And when someone is white they don't ever explicitly say. It's just assumed white is the default and everything has to be explained or addressed. 

Sorry for the vent. It's just dehumanizing, and fetishizing. I get it you've read one book they described a white person as having milky skin. It's not the same.

If you want better ways to describe skin tone check out this helpful link! I would be fine with literally any description that doesn't have a historical connotation of dehumanizing and fetishizing black people. 

If you'd rather have an author who describes people of all colors the best I've ever seen read nk jemisin.

This chocolate thing isn't something I'm making up. It's a relatively common complaint into black spaces. 

**The book ""The Delectable Negro: Human Consumption and Homoeroticism within U.S. Slave Culture"" also touches on this! If you're not understanding the history, context or just not getting how calling a black person chocolate and a white person milk are different and how it's definitely fetishizing, dehumanizing and sexual, read this book!**

Edit: there's seems to be this assumption that I'm young and some kinda Twitter/tumblr sjw who is only looking to be outraged and this isn't isn't a real thing that happens and if it is it's not that bad. And if it's that bad there's more important things we can be talking about. 

Also there's a sweeping assumption that I'm a woman because my comments were seen as emotional and frustrated and because no man cares about you this shit. 

I'm a dude. I'm black. It's just a topic I care about. Calling black people chocolate is fetishizing and has so much historical context behind it it's jarring. It's also cliché. So much so it's a old topic. I seriously didn't think I'd have to prove this common thing exists.

Yes white people sometimes get described as milky, alabaster or the other terms in comments. No it's not the same thing as describing black people as chocolate. It's dehumanizing and fetishizing.

Ask any black woman who is on dating apps how many times she's called chocolate by white men and then ask her if she likes it.


**TLDR: if you're going to describe skin color, describe everyone's skin color not just anyone not white. If you're describing black people don't use chocolate or mocha etc because they are fetishizing and dehumanizing. Have empathy, just bec you personally don't care about this subject doesn't mean it's not important.**

All I see is a jumble of words that don't seem to go anywhere in my mind. I also have no internal reading voice (well I do but it's just flat and monotone and has no emotional connection to words at all missing all the range and cadence needed to read) and on top of that my mind doesn't form any images unless I have already seen what Im trying to imagine. As you can see these factors make it almost impossible to read fiction novels. 

Well it took me a lot of hard work and a lot of time and concentration but I did it! I finally fulfilled my ambition of reading Stephen King's IT.

This ambition all started in the 90s when the IT miniseries first came out, I instantly fell in love with the whole thing from the characters to the place of Derry, Maine. I watched it so much that I knew it inside out, but I always knew by word of mouth that the book was a million times better.

Ive tried on and off to read this book but have always failed at pretty much page 1. Well after the new movies came out I was adamant I was gonna read this thing even if it killed me. 

I thought about my problems for a long time and finally came up with solutions to get past them... Basically I used the audiobook read by Steven Weber to replace my inner voice, I invested in the first edition to read along with (thoughts being that if I invested money it would be further incentive) and I sat in a dark room to block out all stimulus other than the words (using a reading lamp aimed only at the book). 

So I started the audio book and read along with the voice and it worked, it started going in! His voice sort of became my own and because I'd seen the miniseries and movies I didn't have any issues knowing what things and people looked like.

Well it took me since December but I finally reached the end and **OMG** what an amazing journey. Its probably been one of the greatest feelings and experiences in my life! I really can't get across enough how much I loved it. I struggle very much with emotions but this experience made me feel what I assume people refer to as emotion. The book is so so **SO** much better than any movie. I loved it so much that I am in the process of reading it again 😊

I just wanted to share this hoping it might inspire someone else to not give up on reading, it can enrich your life so much if you invest the time and effort. I also just wanted to share because I'm just so proud of myself.

Sorry this has been so long (and probably hard to make sense of, not great at writing either), but thank you for taking the time to read it.


IT Fan.

**For anyone wondering, my next book will be The Stand and my ultimate goal is to reach The Dark Tower. I will keep everyone updated with my progress in further posts.**

**TWITTER EDIT** I contacted Stephen King on twitter as some of you told me to, I don't think he will reply but I tried. My twitter is @Autistic_IT_Fan if anyone wants to know. 

**edit** I didn't expect this much response, I'm blown away. Thank you everyone and I am trying my best to reply to you all. Sorry if I miss anyone but its very difficult to keep up. 😊

**edit 2** Wow, thank you for the awards everyone 😁 I never thought in a million years I would get this response, it's given me so much drive to continue my reading journey.

**edit 3** Thank you so much everyone, I have never felt this much support or praise in my whole life. Its overwhelming. Thank you all for being so kind.

* It has come to my attention that my autism may not be the only reasons for my struggles (aphantasia). so I apologise to anyone who has autism and can read perfectly well."

However actually getting around to reading is a huge problem for me, I put off reading way too much and I usually end up doing something else instead.

I just read a book called Corrine and it's a good romance about a girl who leaves a fundamentalist Christian church and has very Mormon vibes. I live in Utah, I grew up here, so I know all their favorite things (like naming their sons Enoch, the main character's name). 

The writing seemed very similar to Twilight as I was reading it, and I checked the back for the author and it says ""Rebecca Morrow is a pseudonym for a New York Times Best Selling author"".

Is it possible she is writing a book that would cause her to be excommunicated from her church and didn't want anyone to know? 

Let me know if anyone else has read it and what you think. I think it's a fun conspiracy, but I honestly think it's true!

Edit* In case anyone cares, further clues are as follows: 

It has a review from Jodi Picoult on the back. Why would she review a book from some nobody?

The cover marketing and book quality reeks of money. Big ole hardback book too.

I've read the Twilight series over 20 times and immediately recognized the writing. And then I looked at the back cover and found it was written under an anonymous bestselling author.

She mentions the leading male's hair color A LOT. Anyone remember Edward's copper head of hair mentioned a hundred times? Because I do.

Corrine is known as a specifically non-Mormon town established in Utah.

Update: I didn't expect this post to blow up, and I promise I wasn't trying to oust Stephanie Meyer and get her in trouble. I bet she was just trying to avoid awkward conversations in her ward, and she'll be totally fine."

But even then there’s big stuff I don’t remember like what was in the chamber of secrets, who the prisoner of Azcaban was, what the other horecruxes were, and what the triangle circle line logo thing was. I do remember quite a bit of Goblet of Fire though for some reason.

I think forgetting the movies kinda enhanced my reading experience because when I’ve tried reading other books of movies I’ve watched I have a hard time picturing things different from how I remember it.

Really excited to keep on reading ☺️

Edit: Just wanted to say I’m not trying to bag on the movies - just that forgetting the movies is helping me imagine things more freshly. The book made very vivid images in my head and that’s a testament to JK’s writing."

viaqkx,I think refusing to name your ghostwriters is immoral,12374,0.82,691,2022-06-22 23:06:29,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/viaqkx/i_think_refusing_to_name_your_ghostwriters_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/viaqkx/i_think_refusing_to_name_your_ghostwriters_is/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"I'm thinking of three authors right now:

* Danielle Steele, 179 books in about 49 years, who [claims she regularly writes 22 hours a day](https://www.glamour.com/story/danielle-steel-books-interview). I'm gonna go out on a limb and call bullshit.
* R.L. Stine, over 300 books in 30 years
* R.A. Salvatore, 103 books in 34 years
* *numbers are probably slightly off*

I think these authors should list their ghostwriter's as co-authors for the following reasons:

* They didn't write the book alone. If a ghostwriter substantially contributed to a book, they deserve to be recognized for doing so.
* The author's sole claim to having written the book is false, a lie.
* As a reader, If I like a book, I want to read the other books the ghostwriter wrote.
* The quiet use of ghostwriters creates an unrealistic expectation in new writer's minds that successful writers can crank out 4 or more books a year. I mean, it's possible, but you will wear yourself out.

That's my opinion. What's yours?

**UPDATE**

I can't prove any of these people use ghostwriters. Maybe they don't. I think they do. I think we can agree that there are *some* brands that use ghostwriters to crank out regular pieces of fiction. I actually *love* that this happens, but I still think the true writers should be on the cover.

""You need to pick out the best book you've never read.""

So we went in and after some very careful deliberation I picked out *When the Killing's Done* by T. C. Boyle and he ended up with *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor. Once we revealed our selections he looked me in the eye and said ""Now switch!""

So now I have to read about China's Communist leaders and he has to read T. C. Boyle. I wanted to share this because I thought it was a clever idea for a first date between book lovers and an unusual way of getting to know someone based on their taste in books. 

Has anyone else done something like this? If so, how did it turn out?

I didn't even like the lotr movies at first and now I love them. 
Right now I'm on a Michael chrichton binge and watched Congo and sphere after reading the books and I hated every minute of it. I also thought Jurassic Park paled in comparison to the books and that's one of my favorite movies of all time.

I think it's something to do with human psychology. Even the slightest difference from books to movies makes me mad. Even if that change is for the better.
At least give it a few months before u watch the movie after finishing the book. 

End of rant.

Edit: I agree that there are plenty of movies as good as or better than the books, but my point is that it's not a good idea to watch them soon after reading the book. I think Jurassic Park and fight club are better than the books but when you see them after just finishing the books it always dissappointed me. Not because of the bad quality of the movie but because it wasn't the exact thing I imagined while reading the book. "

Now I’m trying to read Inferno - holy crap, it’s so poorly written. Maybe I’m just realizing now something that’s always been there, but Dan Brown’s writing style is so clunky that it’s ruining the book for me. The fact that he interjects with another art history fact twice a page just pulls me out of the story so much that it’s actually disengaging. And his cringeworthy over-use of adjectives just gets silly at times. While I try not to be a pretentious reader and just enjoy a book for what it is, I can’t deny that I just want to call it quits and never read a Brown book again. I guess I’m writing this cause I’m curious if anyone else agrees or if I’m just an exception. Any thoughts?"

I know that this post is going to be downvoted to hell, although I never understood why people downvote a post that has a different opinion to theirs, but I will say it anyways.. Reading DUNE did not turn out the way I thought it would.
 
I liked science fiction ideas in general ever since I was a kid. It was mostly due to the influence of films and thriller novels with light sci-fi plot lines with the exception of Andy Weir's *The Martian* which I loved. But I wanted to pick up some classic sci-fi works for quite some time.

So, this year, I decided to give DUNE a go as I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie that was supposed to come out this December. I started the novel in August. 

It was going fine until the first couple of hundred pages, but soon the reading experience turned into a tough one. The world building was too complex, and the descriptions seemed to be too much.. of things, traditions, cultures, and whatnot. Additionally, I was having trouble creating the mental images of a lot of things.. example: all the equipment and machinery used on Arrakis.

I don't know if this is how all epic sci-fi is written or if this is specific to particular works but the plot felt to be moving either far too slowly or moving in far too uninteresting way. I think the latter. It was never really exciting to me the journey of Paul and Jessica across the desert and how they get adopted into the Fremen clan.. and the Fremen rituals of Holy Mother and etc...

Unfortunately, none of the things in the book made it a page-turner to me. I gave long break between readings. It took me months to finish this book. But I have to mention that I was reading the new paperback edition. I regretted not going for a kindle edition. That could also be a reason why I read it far too slowly.

I also couldn't connect emotionally to any characters in the book which is strange as there are SO MANY characters. The villain seemed too typical and there are specific plot points that made no sense to me.

Overall, I was quite disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more. I came to DUNE with different expectations and minimal reading experience in hardcore science fiction literature which I believe to also be contributing to how I'm feeling about this novel. I was left fully exhausted by the end and didn't pickup another novel for this month.

This week's atrocity comes to us from Dean Koontz's bestselling 1980 thriller: *WHISPERS*. If you liked watching ""The Room,"" you'll love reading Dean Koontz's *WHISPERS*. It's kind of like James Patterson's *KISS THE GIRLS*, except the plot is completely different, and it is even more stupid.

SETUP:
 
Our protagonists are flying on a Cessna airplane in 1980.

THE SENTENCE:

For a minute, the three of them sat in silence, within the expensive, single-engine, overhead-wing, two-hundred-mile-per-hour, sixteen-mile-per-gallon, white and red and mustard-yellow, airborne cocoon.

CONCLUSION:

If you are Dan Brown, you are probably taking notes so you can imitate that fabulous sentence structure. It was very descriptive. You probably like the way Dean Koontz fit the word ""expensive"" in there, just in case his readers thought Cessna airplanes were cheap. 

I liked the way Koontz tried to set the world record for commas per character in a published sentence. I mean, I can totally picture that Cessna in my head. Can't you? I also like the way Koontz's name makes me think about vaginas.

Speaking of vaginas, the sex scenes in this novel would make Danielle Steele fingerbang herself in a heartbeat. Just sayin'.

Thanks for reading the inaugural episode of **The Worst Sentence**. Tune in sometime in the next six months, and I might get around to doing another one. 

Until then, 

Happy reading!

Also also, I'm an aussie, so it might just be an american thing I don't understand.

Edit: HOLY MOTHER MARY'S KNICKERS! I did not expect for this post to blow up. I would like to start with thanking everyone who commented and liked. I also need everyone to stop commenting, my phone is blowing up. 

So as it occurred to me that I couldn't possibly respond to every comment, I decided to make this edit. I actually wanted to adress the questions yis all had for me. 

1. I DON'T HATE THE BOOK! Jesus Christ a lot of you got the impression that I hated this book. I DO NOT! I merely just think that it's not special. It's somewhat of s good book, but just not a masterpiece. 

2. I was 17 when I read the book. So you can't really say I was too old or anything when I read it. I will pick it up when I'm older, but stop using this argument please.

3. A lot of people were saying that I needed to know the context of when it was released. Well I do know that context, but it doesn't matter. I wanted to know why people TODAY thought it was a masterpiece. I have no doubt that it was very controversial for it's time. But it's not the 1950s anymore. Because that today it's nothing more than a young adult novel. 

4. Also some people were asking if I ever suffered from mental illness. All I will say is that I have attempted suicide on multiple occasions before. 

In conclusion, I don't hate the book, it's enjoyable enough, just not a masterpiece. Also stop commenting please, my phone is literally blowing up. 

G'night."

I meant Gone Girl. This is what happens when you write posts late at night.

I read the book right before the movie came out and was instantly FLOORED by this monologue, and even highlighted it. So when it was portrayed in the movie so perfectly (in my own opinion, at least), I got goosebumps.

The cool girl monologue:
> Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

>Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)

This was *the* monologue that made it difficult for me to hate Amy, but also showed the depth of her character and her emotions.

I don’t know if anyone feels the same as I do. I guess this monologue hit me so much because as a woman, there is always a need to be Cool Girl, but there is also always a Cool Girl to hate or be envious of. To see all the ugly emotions and grievances that go along with trying to be Cool Girl, seeing Cool Girl, or living as Cool Girl."

My God.... it's like Eric Cartman dropped out freshman year, pounded out an incel manifesto and drowned it in Deus ex machina.

How is every female character a manic pixie dream girl? Every female character only exists for tension. He actually refers to women as females. 

Why would the entire world be obsessed with John Hughes movies in 2045? Wouldn't maybe trying to figure out the famine crises be a better use of time? A main plot point in the book is about major corporations producing new media and entertainment so its definitely not a universe where things stopped being made in the 80's. So why not just have a small group of folks in a club be into this stuff? Why does it have to be the whole planet? Damn y'all, move on. 

Japanese culture fetish. Yeah just complete that circle. 

In halfway through it. This book just came to life too day ""oh you like the Clash? Name every song that hit the US charts in the order they were released in the UK."" Then it called me a slut.

And I know this is an audiobook issue not the material but there really should have been a producer or someone who could correct Wil Wheatons pronunciations of certain words. He's mispronounced things like Aspergers (aspejers) and library (liberry).

Honestly, this is just sad."

Throughout school, I skimmed through the chapters of the compulsory reading books and half-arsed the essays that had to be written about them. 

Until I woke up last week with a craving to read something that wasn't displayed on a digital screen. 11/22/63 was recommended to me and from turning to the first page I was unable to put it down. I finished the book today and can easily say that this novel took me on an adventure that I never thought possible. It was such an immersive experience and I am emotionally exhausted, in a good way. It bought joy, laughter, fear, tears. It was frustrating and satisfying at the same time. I was almost tempted to start it again straight away after finishing, but instead I've picked up a copy of Pet Semetary which I'm about to dive in to.

Anyway, I've found a new hobby and just wanted to chime in and say hello!

It's not just that he prefers non-fiction-- he gets mad at Greek mythology because it is ""full of nonsense creatures not based on biology."" He dislikes the Orient Express because none of the events actually happened.

And it's not just novels: he hates anything written which is not firmly grounded in reality (Just for example: refused to finish reading the satire ""A Modest Proposal"" because it's ""nonsense"" and ""could never work in real life""). Like, I'm sure the guy would hate the Declaration of Independence if he wasn't such a die-hard patriot.

He also doesn't recognize writing as a valid art form. He doesn't think it takes any particular skill, that authors only have to ""talk out of their ass,"" make the prose flowery and unnecessarily complicated (I tried to explain what imagery was to him once, and he cited the entire technique as emblematic of poor, cheap writing). Specifically, he compared it to scientific writing, which is entirely precise and unadorned. This bit ticks me off in particular since writing is a passion of mine.

The only book he's ever liked was Jack London's ""Call of the Wild"" he read when he was 8.

And now he thinks schools should pull everything but nonfiction off of the shelves. He's worried that fiction makes kids more prone to misinformation and more likely to become flat-earthers/anti-vaxxers, etc.

How would you explain that that's not the case? That almost NONE of this is the case???

edit: he likes music and art too. It's not a vendetta against entertainment-- just THIS specific form of entertainment.

edit: he's also not religious at all, i dont know where people are getting that from. like, he actually has some kind of grudge against every god and main religious text of every culture

eixln2,PSA: Read books you want to read; not books you think you should read,11872,0.9,723,2020-01-02 17:53:18,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eixln2/psa_read_books_you_want_to_read_not_books_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eixln2/psa_read_books_you_want_to_read_not_books_you/,self.books,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I was going to comment this in the other PSA for NY resolutions but, alas, I arrived late, and I doubt it would have been noticed by anyone. 

Anyway. 

I just wanted to tell you all that it's fine to read whatever you want to read. You don't have to read the classics just because they're there. If you want to read something else - something that interests you more, then go for it! 

I used to say 'I want to read X number of books this year/month' etc and usually I'd end up picking almost entirely from the classics. But I've got news for you - just because they're universally acknowledged as 'classics' doesn't mean they have universal appeal. Frequently, I'd end up abandoning the goal. 

You might find them slow or dull or you don't connect with the characters because you're a 30-year-old man who works as an engineer in Manchester and you struggle to relate to the woes of 19th-century socialites, soldiers and vagabonds. ^(That's not a description of me btw)

I used to find it difficult to read if I was reading something I didn't wholeheartedly enjoy. These days I pick a few books I believe I'll like and then follow it up with a classic I'm unsure of. 

But ultimately my message is that you shouldn't feel pressured to read certain things - read because you enjoy it not because it's something to check off. 

For me - this means my next 5 list looks like this: 

*Ayoade on Top* - Richard Ayoade

*Lanny* - Max Porter

*The Wall* - John Lanchester

*I, Claudius* - Robert Graves

*The Master and Margarita* - Mikhail Bulgakov 

(Yes, I know I'm late to reading those two from the BP longlist. I am always fashionably late.)"

17. If Kung fu then genius . Has a special one fist move or sword technique . Fights are not described in detail mc just punches what ever once and next three paragraphs are others describing how MCis so strong but so young, skinny, looks like girl.
18. Litrpgs where MC is lvl one and kills lvl 30.
19. Warriors that everything slows down when they fight . 
20. Any book where a sword cuts thru something like a hot knife thru butter or a scythe thru wheat is trash. 
I could go on .  I miss books where people worked for their skills and supporting characters mattered because the MC would perish without them .  Supporting characters had personalities and yes even occasionally died in battle and as a reader it was devastating. Soft magic is for the lazy writer.  Soft fighting where a warrior cuts down dozens with a sword with no moves described and no chance of loosing.  And for the love of god don’t gloss over everything that matters in a book and then describe in minute detail what everybody eats at every tavern they come across taking up three pages."
eah30f,The Iliad: I'm enjoying it so far but I can't help cracking up at the way these dudes will just pause in the chaos of battle to shit-talk their opponent for an entire page,11743,0.96,654,2019-12-14 13:30:27,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eah30f/the_iliad_im_enjoying_it_so_far_but_i_cant_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/eah30f/the_iliad_im_enjoying_it_so_far_but_i_cant_help/,self.books,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"This happens a lot throughout the story, but I found this one in particular hilarious. Note, this is all happening in the thick of an intense battle with men fighting all around:

>Paris drew back his arm from the bow  
and shot. Not in vain did the arrow fly from his hand,  
but hit Diomedes' right foot, on the flat part: the shaft went through,  
stuck fast in the ground. Then, with loud laughter, Paris  
sprang out from his hiding place and shouted boastfully:  
""You're hit! Not in vain did my shaft fly! Oh, how I wish  
I'd caught your nether belly, and taken your life away!  
Then would the Trojans have had some relief from their troubles,  
who now tremble before you like bleating sheep with a lion.""

>To him, quite unafraid, strong Diomedes replied:  
""Bowman, foul-mouthed cursor, pretty-locks, ogler of virgins! --  
If you'd only make trial of me face to face, wearing armor,  
then your bow and your showers of arrows would not protect you;  
and even now your boast is just to have scratched my foot!  
I don't care -- it could well have been a daft child or a woman  
that shot me, so blunt the shafts of a weakling, a nobody!  
Very different indeed, if it only grazes its target,  
is the sharp spear sped by *my* hand: it brings a man instant death,  
and the cheeks of his widow are torn in death and mourning,  
and his children are orphaned, while he reddens the earth  
with his blood, and rots, more vultures than women round him.""

I think it's the fact that Paris basically pinned Diomedes in place with an arrow through the foot, creating the perfect opportunity to take him out while he's hindered, but instead opts to stand out of arms reach and boast about hitting him, that makes this passage so funny to me. I guess that's a part of Paris' character: He's got a loud mouth but not enough courage to take on Diomedes, even in this weakened state.

I would love to see a parody of The Iliad that captures this; all the soldiers around them pausing the fight to let them duke it out verbally, ooooooo-ing at some of the biggest burns."
qoyp74,Authors who describe EVERY single female that appears in thier book as if they are a potential lay is a way to instantly lose my respect.,11744,0.77,1868,2021-11-08 03:19:02,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qoyp74/authors_who_describe_every_single_female_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qoyp74/authors_who_describe_every_single_female_that/,self.books,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"It's just lazy.

I dont care how down to earth or likeable a main character is. When the perspective comes across like every  woman they encounter is either lusting after them, or being sized-up and put into different categories of dream-girl archetypes, it turns the otherwise relatable main character into a leering creep. 

Can you imagine reading a book where every male character was introduced as simple archetypes like ""bad boy type"", or by the size of thier package, despite thier role in the story?


Edit:
If it matters, I also like women and get the appeal of reading about boobies, but I dont need to know about every booby if said booby isnt important to the story.

Edit #2:
I'm sorry I cant respond to y'all, I'm only human! 

If you like your books filled with dream girls and ladies who breast boobily, power to you. You read those books, and I will choose others. The authors will still.make money, and I dont have to finish an off-putting book. Everyone wins! 

Yes, romance books and books with sex and lust being part of the story are not worthy of scorn and obviously get a pass.

I'm personally going to continue to think its weird and off-putting when a book in which sex and lust is NOT the story (in which the main character is NOT intended to be sex obsessed) clearly chooses to reduce a specific group of people in the book (women) down to sexual fantasies."

It made me realize something, ended up crying and laughing at the same time.

I read Matilda when I was 11 as a part of an assignment project my English teacher gave me. I was the child with single parents, in our place single mothers and their family is still treated with discrimination. My school was no different. I had teachers and parents heavily prejudiced against me and my mom. It also didn't help that my mother had mental, economic issues, which made her a terrible mother.

Our English teacher was in her mid twenties, and she was stern, everyone used to be scared of her. That summer we all got different books to write assignment on. I think I was the only one given Matilda by her, even though it was a little advanced for 11-year-old's language assignment. I remember crying and having all kinds of emotions, I was relating so much with Matilda. I was also parenting myself, dealing with abuse, also a bookworm. There weren't many books at that time I could relate to. A book that tells me someone like me deserves care and support as well, horrible parents and teachers are not right just because they are adults, to find solace in books, if you cannot find in company.

A few years after that I became an orphan, around that same time period the young stern teacher who looked after me without me realizing it, got diagnosed with cancer. She died, leaving her husband and infant devastated.

I want to be able to call her or go to my old school, find her and hug her. Tell her how much her guidance has helped me become a person I can be proud of today. I want to thank her for being one of the best teacher in my lifetime. She was young, she was nearly the age I am right now, and she did so well. The world is unfair, I knew that, but At this moment this hits me extra hard.

Update: my school went through a major administrator change, very few old teachers remained. And given this happened more than decades ago when social network wasn't a thing, nobody really knows where her family members are. Specially I think our previous principal could be kind of obnoxious, and we felt the school was kind of avoided by the family members. The ex principal kind of made it into a thing when she was sick, (They used to make anything a thing about themselves. ) So maybe it was intentional choice, I'll still try to find and contact a really old teacher who is the only possible person to know anything, though he left school. But, this maybe the last update."

I personally refuse to own any books that I will not read. I have given away, such books in the past. I like to keep my bookshelf filled with books/things I treasure.

* How do you get away with murder when some cops can read minds?
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* Very enjoyable - good, concise world-building.  And an excellent job making a protagonist who is a bad guy... but you still want him to win.  Romantic plotline is unnecessary and feels very groomingy.  Sharp writing.

1954 - They'd Rather Be Right by  Mark Clifton & Frank Riley

* What if computers could fix anything, even people?
* Worth a read? No
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Heaps
* This book is straight up not good.  An almost endless stream of garbage science mixed with some casual sexism.  Don't read it.  It's not bad in any way that makes it remarkable, it's just not good.

1956 - Double Star by Robert A. Heinlein

* An actor puts on his best performance by impersonating a politician.
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* A surprisingly funny and engaging book.  Excellent narrator; charming and charismatic.  Stands the test of time very well.

1958 - The Big Time by Fritz Lieber

* Even soldiers in the time war need safe havens
* Worth a read? No
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Pass
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* A rather bland story involving time travel.  Uninteresting characters and dull plot are used to flesh out a none-too-thrilling world.  Saving grace is that it's super short.

1958 - A Case of Conscience by James Blish

* What if alien society seems too perfect?
* Worth a read? No, but a soft no.
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Plenty
* Not bad, but not that great.  It's mostly world building, which is half baked.  Also the religion stuff doesn't really do it for me - possibly because the characters are each one character trait, so there's no believable depth to zealotry.

1959 - Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein

* Welcome to the Mobile Infantry, the military of the future!
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* Status as classic well earned.  Both a fun space military romp and a condemnation of the military.  No worrisome grey morality.  Compelling protagonist and excellent details keep book moving at remarkable speed.

Edit: Many people have noted that Starship Troopers is purely pro military.  I stand corrected; having seen the movie before reading the book, I read the condemnation into the original text.  There are parts that are anti-bureaucracy (in the military) but those are different.  This does not alter my enjoyment of the book, just figured it was worth noting.

1959 - A Canticle for Leibowitz

* The Order of Leibowitz does its best to make sure that next time will be different.
* Worth a read? **Yes**
* Primary Driver (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* Bechdel Test? Fail
* Science Gibberish? Minimal
* I love the first section of this book, greatly enjoy the second, and found the third decent.  That said, if it was only the first third, the point of the book would still be clear.  Characters are very well written and distinct.

Notes:

These are all Hugo winners, as none of the other prizes were around yet.

I've sorted these by date of publication using this spreadsheet  [https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i\_made\_a\_listspreadsheet\_of\_all\_the\_winners\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/8z1oog/i_made_a_listspreadsheet_of_all_the_winners_of/)  so a huge thanks to u/velzerat

I'll continue to post each decade of books when they're done, and do a final master list when through everything, but it's around 200 books, so it'll be a hot minute.  I'm also only doing the Novel category for now, though I may do one of the others as well in the future.

If there are other subjects or comments that would be useful to see in future posts, please tell me!  I'm trying to keep it concise but informative.

Any questions or comments? Fire away!

Edit!

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man.  Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it was the best binary determination I could find.  Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years.

Further Edit!

Many people have noted that science fiction frequently has characters who defy gender - aliens, androids, and so on - looking at you, Left Hand of Darkness!  I'd welcome suggestions for a supplement to the Bechdel Test that helps explore this further.  I'd also appreciate suggestions of anything comparable for other groups or themes (presence of different minority groups, patriarchy, militarism, religion, and so on), as some folks have suggested.  I'll see what I can do, but simplicity is part of the goal here, of course.

Edit on Gibberish!

This is what I mean:

""There must be intercommunication between all the Bossies. It was not difficult to found the principles on which this would operate. Bossy functioned already by a harmonic vibration needed to be broadcast on the same principle as the radio wave. No new principle was needed. Any cookbook engineer could do it—even those who believe what they read in the textbooks and consider pure assumption to be proved fact. It was not difficult to design the sending and receiving apparatus, nor was extra time consumed since this small alteration was being made contiguous with the production set up time of the rest. The production of countless copies of the brain floss itself was likewise no real problem, no more difficult than using a key-punched master card to duplicate others by the thousands or millions on the old-fashioned hole punch computer system."" - They'd Rather Be Right

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don’t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn’t there; I’m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King’s interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I’m a guy who sheds tears a lot—I mean a *lot*—while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I’m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn’t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can’t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I’ve ever read. Now that I’m finished with it—it’s the morning after—I have no idea where to go next. I know I’m going to read another one of King’s books, but just the thought that there won’t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

Thanks for reading my rant."

One of the best books I've ever read, not even exaggerating. A breath of fresh air.

Then book 2 came out. It's bad. Like...*really* bad. Almost unrecognizable. I'm super bummed out. And there is going to be a third book. And strange as it sounds, I'm 100% confident book 3 will be better than book 2.

Why? Because I've seen this SO MANY times. Great book 1, but the writer is obsessed with making it a trilogy, because that's what so many other writers are doing. So you get a book 2 were very little of note actually happens. The writer needs to fill up space so it can become a proper trilogy. And it's nothing like book 1 which you loved so much. But then book 3 is all fire and lighting, because everything gets squeezed into it for a climactic ending.

There is no shame in having a series be 2 books. And if you have a story that has so much to tell it needs to be 3 or more books, by all means. Just don't make it a trilogy for the sake of it being a trilogy, because readers will notice very fast that it actually shouldn't be 3 books content-wise."

EDIT:
So, uh, I guess this is on the front page?  Some general trends I've noticed and can address:

* I do not have a favorite book, but I have a favorite 30 (currently 29 while I debate what will replace Spin by Robert Charles Wilson that didn't pass muster on a reread this weekend): https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/15431237-justin?shelf=meta_top_thirty&utm_campaign=mybooksnav&utm_content=mybooks_cta&utm_medium=web&utm_source=homepage
* The string that looks like a noose is my attic access pull cord
* Yes, I have Battlefield Earth.  It's a favorite SciFi adventure story detached from Scientology.  Lots of fun, I've read it multiple times.
* Yes, Twilight is there.  I have read them and enjoyed them.  I did it before the movies and I have no regrets.  I have read and enjoyed many books that fall all over the continuum of quality.  I'm not a fan of bagging on books even if I didn't like them. You can keep yelling at me about it but is it really worth your time?
* I estimate, roughly, that there are 1,200 books.  I have read somewhere between 70-80% of the whole library.  It's closer to 90% if you just count SciFi/Fantasy books.
* Yes, the Walking Dead omnibuses are out of order.  I've forgotten the face of my father."

They always give the same few excuses:  

""This looks too difficult for you."" So what? Kids need to be challenging themselves. It's never the case that these kids wandered into the adult section and picked up a Henry James book or a 50 Shades knockoff. It's usually a popular children's chapter book they pick up. If they're interested in the story in the first place, they would power through the difficulties and just maybe become better readers. Or you can spend some time reading the book with them and helping them become better readers.

""You've read this before."" Is it so bad to read the same book multiple times? Even adults who claim to love reading think it's silly to reread books. Getting to know the story better means you'll understand it better and get a deeper insight into it. Obviously if they want to read a book multiple times it means they have a deeper connection with it. Why take away that pleasure?

""We have enough books already."" Our limit's like, 50 books. Are you worried you won't be able to keep track of them all and accidentally return them late? Then do what some of my coworkers do and come up with a system. Teach your kids some responsibility. Are you worried they won't finish it all before they're due? Well, I guess they'll learn the hard way not to splurge and get too much at the same time. 

""This just doesn't look good."" Now this I genuinely don't understand. Why force your own unfounded opinions on your child? Why would you teach them to be judgemental and literally judge books by their covers? Why would you limit the wonderful world of books and reading?

Of course I didn’t recently discover them, but I hadn’t actually been to one since I was a kid until just recently, because I have a 1 1/2 year old kid who just wants to be read to all day. Me and her mom can’t afford to buy her new books often, so I googled library branches near me, just so we could get her new books to cycle through on a regular basis, but I did not remember what a tremendous resource libraries could be. They are cool AF. And librarians know everything. 

Also, taking my baby to the library twice a week got me and my wife back into reading. We’ve always liked reading, but we would always buy new books whenever we wanted to read something. Now we’re both reading multiple books a week. 

Anyways, that’s it. I just needed a soap box so I could tell everybody they should visit their libraries. And donate to their libraries. And fuck anybody, especially any politician, who tries to convince you libraries aren’t essential. Libraries are an epicenter for knowledge and culture. Visit and support your local libraries in any way you can. 

Edit: Loving my library got me gold! Thank you stranger!"

We (my wife, our 7yo son 3yo daughter, and myself) lost our house to a fire last May. My collection was just over 1100 books, and I truly loved every single one of them. I went through every identifiable item in the house with the inventory specialist our insurance company sent, because I don't really have an emotional attachment to any of the ""things,"" whereas my wife sobbed at even the thought of seeing it. Fast forward to Christmas. Behind the boxes of Legos for our son, and the princess gear for our daughter, were stack after stack of books, lovingly picked by my beautiful wife. Stephen Ambrose, Aldous Huxley, Ken Follett, William Golding... 35 books in all. Hard to explain to her why I couldn't muster a single tear in the hospital when our daughter was born, yet couldn't stop the biblical torrent streaming down my 38yo cheeks because of a few King novels. 

Update: Thank you all so much for the responses! I didn't expect this much outpouring of support and well-wishes, and don't really know how to process it. It feels wrong to, for lack of a better way of putting it, mourn the loss of ""things."" We were out when the fire happened, so no one was hurt (our two cats were home but came out of it unscathed), and grieving over possessions leaves me with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I guess that's what led to my post in the first place. Having an emotional response to this beautiful gift has left me feeling more things than I know how to process, and writing about it has, surprisingly, helped. 

Thank you all again. 


Update 2: Holy cow! This community is incredible! I have received so many offers to send books, that I can't keep up with them all.

kocewk,Shrek was a book?!,11150,0.96,300,2021-01-01 20:19:29,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/kocewk/shrek_was_a_book/,self.books,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"I was doing some reading about the history of [Shrek](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Shrekcover.jpg) (long story), and learned that it was a children’s book written ten years before the movie came out.

Not only that, but it was written by William Steig--who you might recognize as 1. A super prolific children's author ([Dr. De Soto](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/CoverofDoctordesoto.gif), Sylvester and the Magic Pebble), or 2. The most-ever published author and illustrator in the [New Yorker](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/new-yorker-february-15th-1964-william-steig.jpg) (in 73 years he worked for them, he produced 2600 drawings and 117 covers).

In short, the guy who wrote Shrek! in 1990 had some serious literary chops.

Curious, I picked up a copy. It’s great, and not what I was expecting. Here are the best parts:

1. **Shrek has super powers.** He gets bit by a snake. The snake dies. He breathes fire, and can spit a flame 99 yards and vent smoke from his ears. He cooks a pheasant with his eyes. He eats lightening.
2. **The art is UGLY in an endearing and iconic way.** I’ve never been a fan of “ugly art” a la Ren and Stimpy, but there is [something endearing about the way Shrek and his malevolence](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/41/36/39/41363963004818debd4c2269b3464ebd.jpg) are depicted. The art fits the theme.
3. **The Verbs are great.** Toddled, spit, cowed, convulsed, hissed things over, kicked, hatched, cackled, crowed, cried, scythed, mumbled...that’s in the first few pages.
4. **It isn’t Disney-fied.** Shrek does not look for redemption. He is a monster. He is hideous. He hates kind things. He still finds a princess (just as hideous), and gets hitched.

And I think that’s the best part. Steig doesn’t use the ogre to make some point about inner beauty, or redemption, or grace.

In the book’s climax, Shrek has to confront his own horrifying visage in a hall of mirrors. This is the perfect spot for Steig to shoehorn in a lesson--for Shrek to look at what he is, reflect on his journey, and learn the error of his ways. Instead, Steig writes:

>***“He faced himself, full of rabid self-esteem...happier than ever to be exactly what he was.”***

Then he marries the princess.

So Shrek has literary origins! Who knew?"
peiw7o,Do people who proudly hate on Catcher in the Rye know it’s about CSA?,11143,0.84,1587,2021-08-30 19:42:21,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/peiw7o/do_people_who_proudly_hate_on_catcher_in_the_rye/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/peiw7o/do_people_who_proudly_hate_on_catcher_in_the_rye/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"**CW: mentions of child sexual abuse (""CSA"")**

I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time. We’ve all heard that liking this novel is a “red flag” and folks seem to talk a lot of shit when men and young boys like this novel especially. I knew this book resonated with some real criminals who enacted awful acts of violence, so I was truly expecting the worst. I was completely shocked by the actual nature of the novel.

As someone who works with teens/in youth services, I found Holden heartbreaking. He’s a teenager dealing with depression, isolation, and trauma, both from the loss of his brother and, it’s revealed, childhood sexual abuse/sexual assault. After he evades assault from Mr Antolini, he has a panic response and confesses to the reader: “that kind of stuff's happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can't stand it.”

I feel like all anybody ever speaks about when it comes to Catcher is how annoying/pretentious Holden is - but isn’t this very obviously a trauma response to unspeakable suffering? Catcher in the Rye isn't about Holden being an ethical model to follow- instead, Holden is deeply flawed and poorly adjusted because he has not been given the resources to heal from the trauma he's suffered. The novel’s approach to sexual violence doesn’t even begin and end with Holden - it permeates the novel, from Jane Gallagher (who is being abused by her step-father) to the sex worker Holden meets in the city to the sexual violence/aggression Holden knows his peers enact against other students and girls he knows.

It’s a really weird “flex” that people think dunking anyone who identifies or likes Holden is impressive. Do people realize that some CSA survivors, especially boys who are far less likely to speak up about their abuse, may see themselves in Holden? Are they aware that finding Holden annoying for whining or being pretentious or jaded or depressed likely perpetuates the idea that the only good victims of abuse are the noble, palatable ones (ie the ones that don’t actually exist outside of movies)? What do y’all think?

**Edit**: **Just to be clear**, **I'm not saying you're not allowed to dislike Holden or Catcher in the Rye**. **I'm talking specifically about the folks who say that anyone who likes the book is toxic or that it's a ""red flag"" to like it or have it on your bookshelves.**"

We follow his  monotonous routine of filing letters, being micro managed and taking the mail to unhappy and crazy neighbors. His personal life is also a mess with random hook ups, breaks ups and deaths.

What makes this book so good isn't the prose; it's blatant and straight forward. It's not the plot as their isn't really one. It's just how raw it is. Henry is both sympathetic and pathetic. I relate so much to him when he complains about bureaucracy and having to fake being interested in your job to your employer. He also seems hopeless for not planning a way out. But that's sort of the thing about this book, there are people who put up with the grind and die. It's horrifying and funny and brutally hoenst.

I've almost finished 1984 - been reading non-stop ever since Winston was arrested. But I need a break, because I feel completely and utterly ruined.

To be honest, I thought that the majority of the book wasn't too bad. It even felt kind of comical, with all the ""two minutes of hate"" and whatnot. And with Winston getting together with Julia, I even felt somewhat optimistic.

But my God, words cannot express the absolute horror I'm feeling right now. The vivid depictions of Winston's pain, his struggle to maintain a fragile sense of righteousness, his delusional relationship with O'Brien - it's all just too much. The last time I felt such a strong emotional gutpunch was when I read *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy.

1984 is an extremely important piece of literature, and I'm so glad I decided to read it."

I looked at the date and length and thought it would be boring, and I even made sure to download a few other books before I started reading it on the assumption that I would need a break during the tedious parts.

There?? Were?? No?? Tedious parts???? I stayed up until 4 in the morning to read the first half and only fell asleep when my eyes could not process any more words. I don't know how Dumas manages to write 1200 pages of nonstop action and intrigure & I am in awe! Les Mis is around the same length, and as much as I loved it, there were definitely parts where Hugo went off on long tangents and my eyes sort of glazed over.

Obviously there were some parts of the book that have aged poorly, but on the whole it was an incredible journey and I'm so glad I finally picked it up.

**ETA: Woah, I was not expecting this to get so much attention. I've seen a lot of commenters saying this convinced them to pick up the book, so yay! I hope you have fun reading! And naturally some people disagree with me and didn't like it, and that's cool too :)**

**As for all the people asking about the title, it was just a bit of hyperbole on my part! I didn't think anyone was straight-up lying, but I assumed they were exaggerating considering the other books I've read that were over 1000 pages all had quite a lot of filler. I was happy to find that wasn't the case!**

Sometimes the jumps are different characters speaking in the first person, sometimes different points in time or history, sometimes different locations.

Is my experience just coincidence, or does this describe everything being published today? Is this a fad like ""shaky camera"" movies were 20 years ago. Or, worst case, is there a reason writers prefer this approach and it is going to be harder and harder to avoid?

I also wonder if movies and TV have influenced novelists. They tend not to be edited chronologically, either.

I know this is a structure that has been around a long time because I remember being shaken I was when I first encountered Mitchener's The Source and the second story line was introduced after I had completely lost myself in the first, but that turned out amazing. What I'm reading lately is just jarring.

Anyway, I felt like winging about it today as a salve to my disappointment. Am I alone in this? Is it a fad that will pass? Is there someone we can petition?"

I had to put my dog down today. I actually don't know if this quote is supposed to be satirical, but it's a philosophy that has gotten me through many funerals and deaths in the past.

I've been reading reading ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. I prefer to read it in small bursts, it's a ton of material which leads me thought provoking ideas while I a delivery drive. I couldn't ever understand it reading it all in a week. Every few pages gives me enough to think about. 

I explained to them that cellphones and social media and the like also contain letters and that this constitutes ""reading material"". The owners response was ""I don't want to ban cellphones"" and the General Manager added ""it is against corporate rules"". As in, cellphones are also banned. So to them cellphones are OK but a book is not. 

I attempted to explain I'm missing the fillings out of some of my teeth due to root canals and me not having the money to replace them. I have to chew with my front teeth (mostly) and I can use my normal masticating teeth very carefully and deliberately. It takes me a lot longer (relatively) to chew food than most people. They decided that the ""book"" was why I was so slow. I've complained about toothaches before and for a good portion of my earlier work career, I could hardly eat at work at all. 

So as my little fuck you to them, I'll be reading my books in ebook format. 

I'm literally the only individual this applies too, and I just wanted to share  my sticking it to the man. 

I found it quite telling that phone games, social media, texting and the like are all ""Ok"". But when I try and better myself and ""read a book"" I'm singled out for it. Tells a lot about American culture nowadays.

Edit: I drunkenly posted this and missed a key part of information. The general consensus is that I was coming back late from lunch and that's why books got banned. 

Before Thursday, you were still expected to work and assist customers and go on deliveries. I bitched about having to do all of that and try to eat. I had Sat down to eat at 210 or so and 320 rolled around and I had only ate about a third of my food since I had to get up constantly. 

Anyways, Friday I'm told they're going to try and give us a ""guaranteed 30min break"" to sit down and eat. Once you're done eating you're supposed to get back to work. Once your meal is done so is your break. Physical books are banned because they don't want me to eat to use the full 30min break time. Most other employees can scarf down their food in 10min or so, it usually takes me about 15min to eat a meal regardless if I read or not.

Thanks for the Gold stranger! "

>As this example makes clear, Daunt started giving more power to the stores. But publishers complained bitterly. They now had to make more sales calls, and convince local bookbuyers—and that’s hard work. Even worse, when a new book doesn’t live up to expectations, the local workers see this immediately. Books are expected to appeal to readers—and just convincing a head buyer at headquarters was no longer enough.

I first saw the movies and was impressed by them. They are well made entertainment with a lot of heart. I later read the books and found them even better than the movies. The movies breeze past you because they cover a lot in a short span. Whereas the books, without any time and budget restrictions, can go in on much more detail.

I was initially hesitant as an adult to give time to books meant for children and teens but my opinion changed early on. Not only do the books mature as they progress, they are also pretty fun to read. Interestingly, for me the plots and the magic/wizardry were unimpressive. Each book is a mystery where someone is trying to kill or hurt Harry and only Harry and his gang can solve the riddle. The magical aspect is mostly by the number and world building is okay. 

Where the books shine are during the mundane moments in between the bigger, plot-driving moments. This includes the class room lectures, the character interactions between the main trio, the Great Hall dinner scenes, the common room discussions, the banters with Malfoy and his gang, Fred and George being clever fools,  the train journey to Hogwarts etc. JK Rowling has written these characters well with nuance and interesting traits but not without their faults. 

The setting of Hogwarts is another positive. A huge castle which acts as a boarding school hidden from the outside world, with a lot of history as well as magical shenanigans aplenty. It makes you weirdly nostalgic for Hogwarts even if our school experiences are vastly different from Harry Potter's."

Translating poetry must be one of the hardest things to do. I remember this anecdote my literature teacher told us, about this Hispanic-Chinese woman (Marcela de Juan) who translated Ancient Chinese poems into Spanish by using Medieval Spanish vocabulary and I remember it being a hugely different experience. Translated poetry almost acts as a different version to the original poem itself, and there's something beautiful and odd about it. That's why I think we should be ‘forced’ to enjoy both.

Edit: I believed it to be unpopular since I kind of said they ‘must’ be translated (i.e. compulsory for all copies), apparently I was wrong and most people share this opinion. In my country however, most poetry books are solely published in its translated version; I am aware there are quite a few publishing houses doing it like this, even Penguin Classics with texts written in older forms of English, but didn't know it was as ubiquitous as people here point out. I'd just like it to be the general rule."

For years I gave up reading. But of course in my busy life it was hard to find time to game. I frequently stayed up till 2 or 3am to play. In the end I realized my current stage of life just does not allow me the luxury to sit down and game for uninterrupted hours at a time. A year-and-a-half ago I picked up a novel for the first time in a very long time. I fell in love with reading again, and have found the portability and flexibility of reading fits my lifestyle so well. You can easily read snatches of a book at a time without needing to devote large tracts of time to it. Plus audio books have been great to fill in commute time and make yard/house work more fun. Lastly, novels provide more satisfying and rich narrative than a lot of games do. One day maybe I'll game again, but I'm glad to rediscover reading.  
  
Tldr: Books are portable and can be accessed anywhere, unlike my console/gaming pc  
  
Edit: A lot of people have asked what book got me back into reading. It was **Something Wicked This Way Comes** by Bradbury. 
 
Also, wasn't trying to knock gaming as a hobby. If that's what you enjoy go for it. "

c4sd6f,"Newer dystopians are more story focused, as opposed to older dystopians written for the sake of expressing social commentary in the form of allegory",10650,0.93,561,2019-06-24 23:23:06,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c4sd6f/newer_dystopians_are_more_story_focused_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c4sd6f/newer_dystopians_are_more_story_focused_as/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"This is a long thought I’ve had bouncing around my brain juices for a while now

Basically in my reading experiences, it seems older, “classic” dystopians were written for the purpose of making complex ideas more palatable to the public by writing them in the form of easy-to-eat allegorical novels.

Meanwhile, newer dystopian books, while still often social commentary, are written more with “story” and “character” than “allegory” in mind.

Example one- *Animal Farm.* Here is a well thought out, famous short novel that uses farm animals as allegory for the slow introduction of communism into Russia. Now, using farm animals is a genius way of framing a governmental revolution, but the characters are, for lack of a better term, not characters.

What I mean by that is they aren’t written for the reader to care about them. They’re written for the purpose of the allegory, which again, *is not necessarily a bad thing.* The characters accomplish their purposes well, one of many realms *Animal Farm* is so well known. 
(I will say my heart twinged a bit when you-know-What happened to Boxer.)

Another shorter example of characters (and by extension books) being used for solely allegory is *Fahrenheit 451.* The world described within the story is basically a well written way of Ray Bradbury saying “I think TV and no books will be the death of us all.” 

(*1984* is also an example of characters for allegory.)

On the other hand, it seems newer dystopians are written more with the characters in mind- a well known example is *The Hunger Games.* Say what you will about the overall quality of the book, I think it’s safe to say it does a pretty good job of balancing its social commentary and love triangles.

Last example is *Munmun.* It’s only two years old, but basically it’s about poor siblings Warner and Prayer, who live in an alternate reality where every person's physical size is directly proportional to their wealth. The book chronicles their attempts to “scale up” by getting enough money (to avoid being eaten by rats and trampled and such.)

Being an incredibly imaginative book aside(highly recommend it), the author does an amazing job of using the story as a very harsh metaphor on capitalism, class, wealth, etc while still keeping tge readers engaged and caring about the main characters.

In short, instead of the characters being in the story for sake of allegory, the characters and story are **enriched** by allegory.

I have a few theories on why this change towards story and characters has happened:

**-** once dystopians became mainstream authors realized they could actually tell realistic human stories in these dystopian worlds 
**-** most genres change over time, dystopian is no exception 
**-** younger people read these dystopian books and identified with the fears expressed in them. Seeing this, publishers or authors or someone then wrote/commissioned new dystopias, but with the allegory and social commentary watered down and sidelined for romance, character, and story, in order to make it more palatable for younger readers.

([Here’s a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/c9okhi/new_dystopias_are_more_story_focused_because/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to where I go into more depth in this last thought)

If you’re still reading this, wow and thanks! What do you think? Anyone had similar thoughts or reading experiences? Anyone agree or disagree? Comment away and let me know!

Edit: to be clear, I’m not saying it’s a bad thing older dystopians use characters for allegory purposes, I’m just pointing it out. So please no one say “it doesn’t matter if the characters are flat!” I know, human. I know.

Second Edit: someone linked this article, it talks about what I’ve noticed, the supposed [decline of dystopian/philosophical novels ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/whatever-happened-to-the-novel-of-ideas.html) (I can’t remember who linked it, so whoever did, claim credit!)

What surprised me so much was how fresh many of the jokes are for a novel written 128 years ago. There were so many great moments, the hedge maze at Hampton Court, the taxidermy trout in a pub in Streatley, or almost any time Montmorency is mentioned.

I cannot recommend this book enough, but if I go on I'll spoil many of its best parts, so I'll leave you with my favourite passage:

>*It always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should do. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.*

>*I love to keep it by me; the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.*

>*You cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become a passion with me; my study is so full of it now that there is hardly an inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon*

>*And I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by me now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn't a finger mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.*

EDIT: Too many replies now for me to answer them all individually. I'm very glad so many of you already know and love the book. If you're looking to read it, as others have pointed out, there is a free version on Kindle and a free audiobook version on Spotify, though apparently the Hugh Laurie version is abridged.

If it's not your cup of tea, hey that's fine too. Horses for courses.

I felt my whole perspective on life shift after finishing it, and now I can't imagine my life without having read it. Which book has done this for you?",10630,0.94,1384,2021-11-07 12:53:19,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qojj16/i_read_siddhartha_five_months_ago_and_i_still/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/qojj16/i_read_siddhartha_five_months_ago_and_i_still/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"*Quoth Siddhartha: “What should I possibly have to tell you, O
venerable one? Perhaps that you’re searching far too much? That
in all that searching, you don’t find the time for finding?”  
[...] 
“When someone is searching,” said Siddhartha, “then it might
easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he
searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything
enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object
of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the
goal. Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being
free, being open, having no goal. You, O venerable one, are
perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there
are many things you don’t see, which are directly in front of your
eyes.”*  

That is the most beautiful and personally-significant passage I've ever read in my whole life. After reading *Siddhartha,* I felt myself appreciating the world around me just a little bit more. Hesse taught me that the world is filled to the brim with beauty and meaning, but only if slow down and allow yourself to find it.  

Which book changed your life? Is there any passage that you can't get out of your head months or years later?  

EDIT: my Lord, this post has gotten popular. Thanks to everyone who took the time to provide their own favorites. I guess I REALLY need to read *Steppenwolf* and *Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance.*"

down the son of Anthemion, Simoeisios, 

in the full bloom of youth. On the slopes of Ida

descending, by the banks of clear Simoeis, 

his mother had conceived him, while she kept

a vigil with her parents over the flocks; 

he got his name for this. To his dear parents

he never made return for all their care, 

but had his life cut short when Ajax’s shaft

unmanned him. In the lead, as he came on, 

he took the spear-thrust squarely in the chest

beside the nipple on the right side; piercing him, 

the bronze point issued by the shoulder blade, 

and in the dust he reeled and fell. 

A poplar growing in bottom lands, in a great meadow, 

smooth-trunked, high up to its sheath of boughs, 

will fall before the chariot-builder’s ax, ...

and, seasoning, it lies beside the river. 

So vanquished by the god-reared Ajax lay

Simeoisios Anthemides.

- Homer’s *Iliad*, Book IV

One of my very favorite passages in all of world literature is the death of this random Trojan soldier, Simeoisios, who isn’t mentioned anywhere else in Homer’s epic outside of these brief few lines. The fragility of life, the cyclical nature of conception and birth and death, the violence of war and the death of young Simeoisios juxtaposed with the violence of the ax and the gradual, languid rotting of the poplar... In a few lines, we see an entire life from beginning to end, and it’s not cheap or distracting but ethereally beautiful. The descriptions are just enough that you can picture his parents conceiving him on the banks of the river that gave him his name, his parents realizing they will never see their son again, the blood and dust of the fields of Troy, and the slow decay of a felled tree, each scene a perfect successor to the previous. Plus, a major theme of Homer’s epics is that quest for immortality which in our mortal, corporal world is only possible through glory, honor, and legacy. A premature death in battle is the secret to life-everlasting in the minds of men. And this unremarkable soldier achieved it in these few brief lines, and now his death is still read about eons later. It’s probably one of the most perfect pieces of writing I’ve read, and I can’t imagine anyone having a more beautiful or emotional elegy."

Some of the picks were ridiculous (The Bible?), and some a little heavy-handed (*The Prince*?). I guess my problem with lists like these is that they are so long and sprawling. What do I do when I read them all? Grow a beard and barbecue a pig? What's the end goal?

I think these sorts of lists should be smaller and less preachy. So what I am going to do is share a list of books that profoundly influence me as the human being, adult, and man I am. My goal is to share some good stuff. Hopefully people read this, get into these books and writers, and are touched by these stories and ideas. One of my professors said we read fiction to learn how to live better, which is kinda corny but also a little true. So here is my list. Trying not to go too far into summaries. 

1. *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk. Tough lead here. It's a book that's as much about alienation as it is about machismo and nihilism. It's scary that many of us in the early throes of adulthood are lost in the sense that we hit a certain age, get a diploma and/or a job, and stop and say ""now what? Is this what the rest of my life is going to be?"" Tyler Durden is like the manic pixie dreambro, an agent of chaos who can save the world by breaking it, or so he has you convinced. This is a book that speaks to the disenchantment of my generation, built to reach the stars only to graduate into a much colder world, and the thing about *Fight Club* is that it shows how badly insecure people want an answer, any answer. 

2. *Ask the Dust* by John Fante. Arturo Bandini is a young man in his early 20s trying to make it as a writer in LA in the 1930's. It's so easy to relate to him, because as a narrator, he's so candid. He makes his guilt, shame, pride, ego, failure, success all so palpable that it's like I'm right there beside him. It's a good counter to *Fight Club* because it's less cynical, more hopeful, and yet cripplingly tragic in a very soft-spoken way (read the book and that will make sense). This is the second in the ""Bandini Quartet,"" four novels featuring Fante's alter ego. You don't need to read the first for any context here--they all stand alone very well. What's the book about? The reality of chasing one's dreams. 

3. *East of Eden* by John Steinbeck. I really wanted to avoid the run of the mill classics here, because duh, if you are a reader, you should read the classics. This book transcends a classic. It's about fathers and sons, heroes and whores. It's a tome, but it really picks up steam about 200 pages in, and it's so gripping. It's about growing old, and family, and trying to make things right, pride, honor--it's got so much important stuff, and Steinbeck can be subtle, I love the man, but he has no problem hitting you over the head in this one from time to time. 

4. [""Winter Dreams""](http://www.gutenberg.net.au/fsf/WINTER-DREAMS.txt) by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is a short story, and I linked to a crummy PDF. Heart wrenching tale about love. This is one of the stories he wrote while he tried out a bunch of the Gatsby ideas. It's a growing up sort of story. 

5. *Sirens of Titan* by Kurt Vonnegut. I love me some Vonnegut. He's so very good. This is one that falls outside of his ""classics."" He fools around with time being a set single line, Tralfamadorians, and his general absurdist take on everyday life. This is a novel about hope, failure, loss, and redemption. A man (and his dog) who has come unstuck from time figures out a way to save the world and humanity. It's Vonnegut's second novel, and I think it's his best, but I also think all of his stuff is incredible. 

So that's my list. There's lost more, but those are 5 good ones. I don't pretend to say these are some definitive texts. Just really good ones that I like and have inspired me. 

Happy reading. 

EDIT: I am glad this post has taken off a bit. Keep sharing these poignant novels and stories. If you do ""Winter Dreams"" and like it, follow it up with ""Babylon Revisited."" "

“Books are almost as individual as friends. There is no earthly use in laying down general laws about them. Some meet the needs of one person, and some of another; and each person should beware of the booklover’s besetting sin, of what Mr. Edgar Allan Poe calls ‘the mad pride of intellectuality,’ taking the shape of arrogant pity for the man who does not like the same kind of books.”

11yqman,What I like best about book Jurassic Park and villain John Hammond is that all of his wounds are self-inflicted and can directly be traced back to him trying to save a penny,10451,0.96,729,2023-03-22 23:15:42,books,24961197,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11yqman/what_i_like_best_about_book_jurassic_park_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11yqman/what_i_like_best_about_book_jurassic_park_and/,self.books,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Just reread the book for the first time in years, and it really struck me how everything is basically John Hammond’s own fault for trying to save a penny. I’m not talking about his God-complex or inability to recognize that anything bad could possibly happen (although both are major contributors to JP’s downfall). I’m specifically talking about his cost-cutting. The line “We spared no expense” is so iconic that it appears in both the book and the movie, and yet everything that happens at the park is a direct result of John Hammond “sparing the expense.”   
  
1 - It’s mentioned that the staff on the island wanted to install a new dock that would have offered ships greater protection from storms. When a storm comes, the ship is forced to leave early before all their supplies are offloaded because John didn’t want to pay for the more expensive weather-proof dock.   
  
2 - Scientist Henry Wu is nervous because the dinosaurs are too real (too fast, too deadly, etc) and wants to scrap them all in favor of slower, “safer” dinosaurs more in line with visitors expectations. John rejects this out of hand, citing both authenticity and cost.   
  
3 - Game Warden Robert Muldoon warns repeatedly that they need more / heavier arms against the dinosaurs. John refuses and only reluctantly agrees to keep one launcher. When the dinosaurs escape, they are left defenseless due to the only launcher on the island being lost. In the same vein, they only have two gas-powered vehicles on the island and are left without transportation with Nedry taking one and the other already out in the field.   
  
4 - The entire reason the phones are jammed is because of John. John had refused Dennis Nedry’s request of allowing his associates on-site so Nedry was forced to transfer the data back to the mainland via the phone lines. John also denied Nedry’s request of more personnel on the mainland, meaning the lines were down for an even longer period of time.   
  
5 - Speaking of Nedry. The entire reason Dodgson chose him as his inside man was because of how dissatisfied Nedry was with John Hammond. John had Nedry working longer hours than agreed upon, refused his requests for additional resources, and then stuffed him on the overtime. This resulted in a disgruntled employee ripe for exploitation.

Also, what makes it even more special: The first 11 books were written by Robert Jordan, who unfortunately passed away and tasked Brandon Sanderson with the ending of the series using his notes. Incredible how it worked out.

I forgot how much I love reading, how it felt. My imagination is more active than it's been in years and years, vivid images and scenes play out in my head like a movie. 

 I used to read constantly, every single day I'd be reading from when I woke up, during class, when I got home, at night. For 6 years, I have barely touched a book. I have so much time on my hands but I've wasted it with TV shows and movies and games which barely catch my interest. Just passing time.

 (edit: I don't mean that video games, tv and movies are a waste, I just have been watching garbage because I've already watched all the movies, shows and played all the games that I enjoy.) 

 About two weeks ago, I downloaded a reading app on my phone, got about 300 ebooks. Books I've wanted to read for years, every genre that I love, and got right into it.

I finished my first book, The Last Wish in three days, then I started the Long Walk, which I also finished in three days, then Annihilation which took me about a full day of reading.

These books made my imagination swirl and my heart felt tense, I was absolutely enamoured with how much I loved reading them. How intense they felt compared to movies and tv shows, it reminded me of why I loved books. 

Now I'm reading Paradox Bound, I opened the book and read for 8 hours straight, barely taking a break for food or water. I got about half way through the book in a single session, unable to put it down. I'm absolutely  loving it. It just gets better, the first few chapters I slogged through but once I got to a point where my interest catched, I was hooked and I cannot stop reading.

I've organized all my books, both physical and digital, I've created spreadsheets for Page Numbers, Read Order, Series Orders. I've set goals for myself. Every book I read, I'm writing a page long review for my favourite parts, my dislikes, the parts I hated. 

I'm still depressed but now I can read, so that makes it better :) 

All I want to do now is read more.


edit:  Thank you guys for being nice and really kind about this, it really makes my effort feel appreciated by someone

Then they appeared on compact disc.

I never thought there was anything wrong with them, or that they weren't ""real reading"", I just never got into them. Maybe the selection back then was lacking, so it was mostly popular fiction, which isn't what I usually read.

About five years ago I started working remote location industrial construction jobs and I got a tablet for my 18 hour commute. I got so many magazines from the library that I eventually had to cut my subscriptions in half, I just couldn't read them all. The same app has audiobooks but I never bothered to check any out.

I don't even know what eventually motivated me to do it, but this year I finally checked one out.

My life is transformed. Anytime I'm doing something that I used to listen to music for, it's now audiobooks. If I'm in the kitchen (I live alone), I've got an audiobook on. If I go for a walk, I listen to a book. I almost wish I had a commute, so I could listen to more audiobooks. If I could be listening to a book but I'm not, I feel like I'm wasting my time.

So far this year I've read two physical books but I'm closing in on ten audiobooks and I haven't even been at it all year. It's all been during time that I've been doing other things. I just feel like I've doubled productivity for a large portion of my life. I've got 13 more on my holds list and another 120 tagged for interest.

edit: Thanks for all the comments and discussion, I didn't think this would be of such interest.

Yes, I'm familiar with podcasts but I don't generally find them interesting. I might like one or two episodes but rarely the whole series.

I use the Libby app with access through my local library and suggest others do the same.

Yes, it was really an 18 hour commute. I live on the west coast but was building a hydropower dam in northern Manitoba. It took one taxi, two commercial flights, one charter flight and a four hour bus ride to get to work. We did twenty one days in with seven days off."

I knew what Lolita was before I read it. I knew it was about a sick, evil man ""falling in love"" with a little girl and taking advantage of her after her mother dies. But I think going into the book with this knowledge actually made it MORE difficult to come to terms with. 

I hated Humbert. He's evil, he's deranged, and I wanted to feel happy when he died. But I couldn't. When he killed Clare Quilty and drove recklessly, covered in his blood, so detached from anything, I cried. I hate Humbert, and the book was so wonderfully written that I actually empathized with him, and I was lowkey disgusted with myself for it. I know he's the epitome of an unreliable narrator and that he spends the duration of his confession lying to himself and the reader, but I actually caught myself feeling sorry for him. He's a deranged man, destroyed by an obsession that drove him to destroy the lives of others. 

But then I realized... I was falling for Humbert's trap. That is what Humbert WANTED me to feel. He made me feel his suffering, his fear, his pain so deeply that I nearly forgot about Dolores, the real victim of the story. He destroyed her. He completely destroyed her and I was almost too blinded by Humbert's misery to see it, and yet it's plain as day. When he was killing Clare, I caught myself feeling like Humbert was a man, hopelessly in love, destroyed by that love, and he had that love torn from him and was left with nothing. Humbert wanted the reader to feel that way. 

Humbert didn't love Dolores. He loved the idea of her. He was so obsessed with his sick idea of ""nymphets"" that he completely forgot that they were just kids. He was so obsessed with Dolores, put her on such a high pedestal that he completely forgot that she was a person, a HUMAN BEING who he utterly destroyed. And I was so blinded by the tale of a man losing himself in insanity, to the point where I was crying because I FELT SORRY for this miserable sack of shit, that I too forgot for a moment that Dolores was a person, a child, and she was the one who was actually the victim in all of this. That probably sounds insane to anyone who hasn't read the book and that's because it is. Dolores lost her mother, her friends, her innocence, her WHOLE LIFE and it was old poor Humbert that I caught myself crying for.

I feel like reading is something you have to *do*, whereas watching TV is something that's being done *to* you. I feel like depression is sapping my motivation to do anything, so I generally prefer to just sit back and watch some mindless TV.

There are books that I actually want to read, I just lose motivation really easily. I was excited to get a book from the library and when I started reading it I only read up to page 5. There was a highly recommended book from my favorite genre and it still took me a month to get to page 100. I could spend 6 hours a day watching TV and think nothing of it though.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?

For three of those days I sat on my porch and read Dune until it got dark and then I lay in bed with a flashlight on my chest reading away. Dune is one of the greatest books I've ever read. Paul having to go through all that after his father's death and realizing his part in this prophecy that has to come true was just astounding. The Fremen are the coolest sci-fi people ever, the way most of Arrakis underestimates them and how they survive on that awful planet is so cool. I really thought it was funny that the Atreides came from Caladan this planet with such an abundance of water to a desert planet where water is the most precious resource you can obtain. The Stillsuits are the coolest thing ever too. The way everyone analyzes eachother in italics is a really cool way to write. The major importance of spice and its impact on the universe is wild. The politics, betrayals, and the enemies' pov's were so interesting. My only real let down was the ending, dont get me wrong the big assault on the Emperor's ship was awesome but the way the book just says Paul's son is dead and not showing us and how he gets the Emperor's Court to come to the old Atreides palace just to kill Feyd-Rautha and demand the Princess Irulan, I just thought the book could of had more there. Another thing that let me down was Paul in the end becoming almost a monster and nothing like the way his father ruled, his own mother was afraid of him and she was a badass; also Gurney not getting to kill a Harkonnen was a bit unsatisfying. All these things made the book all the more interesting and I loved them but they were still a little disappointing. This book and all the interesting aspects, like still suits, Mentats, the Bene Gesserit, the Makers, will always be apart of my mind. I'm now going to move onto Dune Messiah and Children of Dune and I have no clue what I'm getting into. I'd like to know what some of you guys thought of Dune."

The bookstore wasn't perfect, it didn't have much room to move around in nor did it have a lounge area where you could sit down like some new bookstores are doing. But the owner and the employees were helpful with a wide breath of knowledge and very happy about their job, willing to share everything.

I remember around 10 years ago I was very into detective novels and wanted to read Arsene Lupin but couldn't find it anywhere online in Sweden or any bookstore. But I went there and they managed to find a copy, ordered it for me and let me check out the contents for a few minutes before I had to pay. I read that book around the time my great grandmother passed away and I won't forget about either of them for as long as I live.

There was no new owner of the bookstore and we won't be getting another one. With the online stores being so simple to order from and with a large variety of books I doubt people will want jsut another run of the mill bookstore. 

Why didn't the owner of the bookstore try to innovate you might be wondering? It all comes down to rent. We even had a bakery close down due to bancruptcy and that just sounds absurd to me. Our city centre have a handful local businesses left, every other store is a large chain. 

Do you have any stories you'd like to share about your local bookstore or ideas on how to improve the bookstore business?"

That has to be the most ingenious and best mystery book I’ve ever read. I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to compute what I just read. I cannot express in words how bloody amazing it was. You all must read it! Christie really is the queen of mystery. 
🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭

For those of you who aren’t aware, it is a mystery story where 10 strangers are invited to an island, on which they become stranded, and they start getting picked off one by one. 
I also thought it was so incredibly chilling, more so than most of her other books too. The way she wove the web of mystery, skullduggery and suspense was masterful. The nursery rhyme also added a sense of impending doom to myself as the reader. Really clever utilisation of dramatic irony. And the ending was just a punch to the balls! 
I am not surprised in the slightest that this is the highest selling mystery book of all time!

Edit: thank you all so much for the other recommendations. Once I’ve finished all the other books on my list - I’ve got 40 - I’ll get round to all these. They all sound amazing!

Edit 2: I’m so glad I convinced so many of you to pick the book up. I hope you all enjoy it and be sure to return to this post and leave your thoughts when you’re finished! However, I recommend starting on ‘The Murder of Roger Ackoryd’, if you haven’t read any Agatha Christie before - it’s a better introduction to her work. Then read ‘And Then There Were None’.

Edit 3: some people thought i included a spoiler when it wasn’t so to shut them up i’ve removed it. and also, to the trolls: shush.

Edit 4 (god I’m doing a lot of these 😅): thanks to those of you recommended the BBC/Charles Dance adaptation. It was good. I wish they had made it more true to the book, but it was still enjoyable viewing. Charles Dance was excellent. After you’ve finished the book, you ought to watch it. Felt that it wasn’t as chilling as the book, but that might just be because I know the ending lol."

Now that I’m about to graduate I was looking back and realized I only read 1 maybe 2 books each year for fun, and those were usually during the summer when I actually had time. For my New Years resolution I decided to give myself a break and re-read my favorite series that I haven’t read since 8th grade, The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. There are 12 books in the main series and 12 months in the year so I figured one book each month for the year would get me back on track with actually reading for fun and it is really working! This last weekend I sat down and read for 7 hours STRAIGHT before I realized just how long I had been sitting there. I feel like my vocabulary has improved so much, not to mention I’m spending less time on my phone since every time I notice myself wasting time on social media I think to myself “man why am I not using this time to read???”

Just thought I would share! I haven’t posted here before so sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed or whatever! If anybody has had a similar experience I’d love to hear about it, or tips to challenge myself further once I graduate and have more free time!

EDIT: this post blew up way more than I expected! My first gold!!! 
I’ve been trying to read and reply to comments but you guys just keep going! I’ll try to read them all, thank you all for the kind words and great suggestions. If you find yourself in a reading slump definitely scroll through these comments because there are loads of good tips! I’m going to get off my phone now and read some more ;) thank you all, what a great community! <3"

Many times, I have had well-meaning people suggest a book and comment that there is a big plot surprise at the end....but then hasten to add that they aren't going to spoil it.  But they DID just spoil it........

A plot twist is obviously most effective when you aren't expecting it.  If you know the twist is coming, you are constantly on the lookout for it; you are actively speculating what the twist will be.  When it finally comes, there is no real excitement....or even an actual ""surprise"".

I know that it can be incredibly difficult not to talk about an extraordinary reading experience.  I enjoy hearing people talk about a book that they truly enjoyed.  And I (like most people) enjoy an unpredictable plot.  But please keep the ""huge twists"" to yourself.

Admittedly, the reviews and synopsis on the book cover will probably be sufficient to spoil this.  I can't recall the last time that a plot twist was in any way surprising....and that's kind of a shame."

Not because I wasn’t a reader, but precisely because of that. I remember being kinda mad at everyone adult telling me “oh, you read all the time? You must have devoured the HP books like my son did”. HP was so ubiquitous that a contrarian spirit grew in me. Also, I was at that age in where I was feeling proud of reading “mature” books and reading stuff for children (even though that’s what I was) felt beneath me.

So, the whole phenomenon passed me by. Never saw the movies either. Now in my early 30s I feel like I’ve missed out on a big cultural touchstone. 

Would it make any sense to go back and pick up the books from the start? Do they hold up as an adult?

I’m kinda in the mood for a big fantasy saga to read this winter."

I looked at the comments and there was a mixture of agreement and defense of the books.  But as I read further, although there were a decent number of comments, I realized that nobody who had replied really saw the books the way I do. 

Now, I don’t claim to be a superior intellect or any kind of literary critic of note, but in seeing those comments, i realized that a lot of people, even those who enjoy it, seem to have missed the point entirely (or at least the point that I took away from it). So, here is my response reproduced in its entirety in the hopes that it will inspire people to read, or reread, these masterpieces. 

So I’m responding to this maybe a month late but I guess I have three basic thoughts about how I’ve always seen Hitchhikers that I feel like most respondents didn’t capture. 

The first, and most simplistic view of it is that there’s just general silliness around. The people get into silly situations, react stupidly, and just experience random funny stuff. 

The second, still fairly easy to see bit is Adams just generally making fun of the sci-fi genre. He loves to poke fun at their tropes and describe them ridiculously. 

The final bit though is why I think this series is a true masterpiece. In a way, even though Earth gets demolished in the first few pages of the first book, the characters never really leave. All the aliens they encounter behave fundamentally like humans, with all of our foibles and oddities. 

The first time he does it, he really hammers you over the head with it to try to clue you on what he’s on about. A rude, officious, uncaring local government knocks down Arthur’s house - where he lives - in the name of efficiency. The government doesn’t care about the effect on Arthur’s life. What happens next? A bureaucratic alien race demolishes our entire planet, with all of its history, art, and uniqueness, to make way for a hyperspace bypass that literally doesn’t make any sense and isn’t needed anyway. 

In a lot of ways Arthur’s journey reminds me of The Little Prince, a fantastic book in which a childlike alien boy travels from meteor to meteor and meets various adults like a king, a drunkard, or a businessman. They all try to explain themselves to the little prince who asks questions with childlike naïveté that stump the adults. 

Adams is doing the same thing. The Vogons he used as a double whammy to attack both British government officials and awful, pretentious, artsy types. What’s worse than awful poetry at an open mic night and government officials? How about a government official that can literally force you to sit there and be tortured to death by it!

My absolute favorite bit in the entire series is in the second book which you haven’t read (yet, hopefully).  In the original version of the book he uses the word “fuck”. It was published in the UK as is, but the American publisher balked at printing that book with that word in it. 

Adams’s response? He wrote this entire additional scene in the book about how no matter how hardened and nasty any alien in the Galaxy was, nobody, and I mean nobody, would ever utter the word “Belgium.” Arthur is totally perplexed by this and keeps saying it trying to understand, continually upsetting everyone around him. The concept is introduced because someone won an award for using the word “Belgium” in a screenplay. The entire thing is a beautifully written takedown of American puritanical hypocrisy and the publishing industry’s relationship with artists. 

Adams uses Arthur’s adventures to muse on the strange existential nature of human existence. He skewers religion, atheists, government, morality, science, sexuality, sports, finance, progress, and mortality just off the top of my head. 

He is a true existential absurdist in the vein of Monty Python. The scenarios he concocts are so ridiculous, so bizarre, that you can’t help but laugh at everyone involved, even when he’s pointing his finger directly at you. 

Whether it’s a pair of planets that destroyed themselves in an ever escalating athletic shoe production race, their journey to see God’s final message to mankind, or the accidental discovery about the true origins of the human race, there is a message within a message in everything he writes. 

I encourage you to keep going and actually take the time to read between the lines. You won’t regret it. 

EDIT: This is the first post I've written on Reddit that blew up to this extent. I've been trying to reply to people as the posts replies roll in, but I'm literally hundreds behind and will try to catch up. I've learned a lot tonight, from both people who seemed to enjoy my post, people who felt that it was the most obvious thing in the world to write, and people who seem to bring to life one of the very first lines of the book, ""This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time.""

In retrospect maybe I shouldn't have posted this on a Thursday.

I've also learned that I should spend more time in a subreddit before posting on it; apparently this book is quite popular here and a lot of people felt that I could have gone more out on a limb by suggesting that people on the internet like cats on occasion. This has led me to understand at least part of the reason why on subreddits I'm very active on I see the same shit recycle a lot... I'm gonna have a lot more sympathy for OPs who post popular opinions in the future.

At the request of multiple people, here was the thread I originally read that led me to write this response. https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/87j5pu/just_read_the_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy_and/

They began worshiping Sauron, Morgoth and Saruman cult style and children would play ""orc"".

This book completely changed my perspective on how I view society, as well as, our own government.  The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power. In a way, this is not far off from our own government systems, leading me to believe we are not as ""free"" as one would think. 

To this day, my thoughts on these matters have never been the same prior to reading this book.

It’s a short read, less than 200 pages, but in these few pages Elie Wiesel hauntingly narrates his horrific experiences in concentration camps during The Holocaust. The book is a witness to the incredible cruelty that humans are capable of subjecting on one another, and serves as a reminder that we all have a duty to be a voice for the voiceless."

Calvin was like me, kinda: a bratty kid who liked to learn, but who didn't want to learn what was taught to him in school. I used to try to emulate Calvin in elementary school, often with negative results (but when you're lost in your imagination you tend not to notice as much.) Bill Watterson I don't think realized how much his readership extended beyond hip college-aged people, to adults (seniors, even) and the kind of kid (like me) who read the funnies over their bowl of cereal in the morning. I still love them, still read them. In that way, the entire collected series is in itself like a ""book"" in the sense that we know them. Hell, I dated a girl with kids, and not one of the books they read had even 1/2 the imaginativeness of a single C&H strip. I see people who don't know any better with their bootleg shirts and just have to shake my head, knowing how hard he fought for creative control over his creation, and it bugs me, but not so much that I can't look past it. Now we live in a world where the written word has become such an ""old concept"" that it's barely used, but back when I was a kid, you'd read a strip and have to look up a word in the dictionary and that made the strip that much funnier. I miss those days. "

After that, I never heard anyone talk about it. 

I’ve been reading a lot lately, and buying big stacks from Thrift Stores. Thought I’d give it a shot because it was short, probably light, and something that has always felt “unread” to me. Beckoning to me. 

I was floored. This book is incredible. One-sitting, a couple hours, and I looked up and was not the same as I was when I first looked down. I was expecting something very childish, but this is a real dystopian story that follows a boy I’d describe as a hero. It is a more accessible, less “fantastical” version of the Neverending Story in its theme, it’s got a dash of Fahrenheit 451 which has always been a favorite, and I’m seriously peeved I didn’t read it as a kid but extremely glad I finally made the decision as an adult. 

If you haven’t read it, read it. Beautiful, beautiful story, deserving of all its acclaim. If I was an English teacher I’d be psyched, knowing this book existed. It teaches every literary device. Need to show someone Imagery? The whole book is about appreciating real imagery, and the words you use to describe it. Need characterization, static vs dynamic, need symbolism, need foreshadowing? It’s all there and some of it even defines itself. 

Dark, too. Surprising, poetic delivery of some very disturbing scenes. I almost can’t appreciate a book unless there’s an element of darkness and this satisfied.

The book almost wasn't published. Neil's editor said it was going to traumatize kids, so he asked her to read it to her daughter and see if it was too scary. The girl said she was enjoying it every night, and they got through the whole book and she said it wasn't scary so the book was published. Many years later, Neil got to talk to her about the book and she said she was absolutely terrified the whole time but wanted to know what was next, so she lied because she was worried that they'd stop reading the book if she said it was terrifying. 

Just think about it... the book got published because a kid lied about how scary it was.

Even though he writes it to the point to keep us engaging it is very predictable and clichéd if you’ve read his past novels. I will just focus on the RL series.

1) Robert Langdon gets into shit.

2) Shit always has some religious/cult thing associated with it.

3) Somehow finds himself a female sidekick.

4) Gets into some kind of claustrophobic situation.

5) The twists are always that someone/something (can A.Is be considered as “someone”?) ends up being the villain.

It just keeps repeating and repeating with different premises and different characters with the exclusion of Robert Langdon.

He gotta try something new.

It was also the first in a series of books that would go on to become the [best selling book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series) of all time.

The story follows an orphan living at his aunt and uncle’s home who is neglected and mistreated. Later, he is invited to enroll at Hogwarts a school for witchcraft and wizardry. His life changes dramatically when he joins.

The series ignited the spark to read for many young readers that would become a habit, despite the author, J.K. Rowling, becoming a controversial figure recently.

For me, it accelerated my ability to read longer books because the next one in the series was usually longer than the one before it. Before that, I was reading the Goosebumps series as an primary/elementary school student, which were much shorter. The characters were funny and relatable and the plot was interesting and unpredictable. 

Have you read any of the Harry Potter books? Did they affect your life or reading in any way?"

a month goes by and i end up in the same book store to buy a magazine, and i saw the book again and i was like ""screw it ill just buy it"". Boy am i glad i did. I read 100 pages as soon as i got home. my mind was literally blown with every page turn. I cheered in some parts, out loud, over a book....lol. It just astounds me how a book written primarily though the 1940s is still SO relevant today. The theories of psychohistory are so well fleshed out they nearly sound like they could be a legitimate statistical mathematics. The idea that man has gathered so much data over the 12,000 year reign of the empire that they can use that data to accurately predict futures is just such solid foundation for a story. Then how it kind of just flips into the future with totally new characters that relate to the old ones. The excerpts from the Encyclopedia Galactica. It is just one of the most enthralling pieces of literature I have ever set my eyes on, and it made a dude who hasnt read a book in 5 plus years read a book. just wanted to share my experience as i feel like i will be reading all of these! I am also not finished totally yet so no spoilers in the discussion if any plz

EDIT: Holy cow i did not expect this post to blow up! Usually i get like 2 replies lol Thank you guys so much for all of the recommendations and fun discussion! i have about 20 more books to try

This decision has far-reaching consequences that not only hinder app developers but also affect the experience of moderators and users alike, including [impacting accessibility](https://redd.it/13zr8h2). The lack of function in Reddit's official app has made far from a complete solution for moderators, and left many users dissatisfied with their experience with it as well.

​In response to this situation, r/DIY has joined with other subreddits in a coordinated effort. We believe that unity is essential in driving change and advocating for the rights of app developers and the overall user experience. To amplify our message and demonstrate the strength of our concerns, barring any significant positive changes in Reddit's plan,

#**r/DIY will be participating in a blackout starting on June 12th, lasting at least 48 hours.**

During this blackout period, the subreddit will be set to private, rendering it inaccessible to all users. This collective action is intended to raise awareness and urge Reddit to reconsider their recent API changes. Our primary goal is to initiate a productive dialogue with Reddit, leading to a reversal of the detrimental modifications they have implemented.

We understand that this blackout may cause temporary inconvenience to our community, and for that, we apologize. However, we firmly believe that this short-term disruption will bring long-term benefits for every user. By standing together with other subreddit communities, we hope to send a clear message to Reddit and foster a meaningful conversation about the future of their API policies.

In the meantime, we encourage you to let reddit know that you disagree with their planned changes

​There are a few ways you can express your concerns:

* [Sign this open letter to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=whatisthisthinDIYg&utm_content=t3_142ka3s)

* Share your thoughts on other social media platforms, spreading awareness about the issue.

* Show your support by participating in the Reddit boycott for 48 hours, starting on June 12th.

I crocheted my lace wedding dress on the bus during my work commute for about 5 months.  The dress is a pattern I designed with a commonly used pineapple stitch.  Here's a video of my process: http://youtu.be/edFt9Ug5RmY.  The dress was practically free because I didn't spend much money on it (under $30 for all of the materials including fabric for the lining) and I didn't spend much extra time on it.  My commute time couldn't be used for anything else anyway.  The dress is also machine washable (I've washed it several times), doesn't wrinkle or need any special care, and I plan on wearing it again with linings of different colors and with the train bustled up in different ways.  
EDIT: I added photos of our wedding here:https://www.flickr.com/photos/chiduong/sets/72157645815916987/
EDIT: I finally finished the crochet pattern for the dress minus the train (still working on that part): http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/chrysanthemum-lace-dress

EDIT : first time I used imgur... I should have started with the finished result and it seems I can't edit  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Link to finished result : https://m.imgur.com/16T3cEt

EDIT 2 : the patio is completely under a roof. It barely gets wet even with heavy rain and the wind directly towards the facade. I make a bigger mess when I water my plants ;)

EDIT 3 : I thought about it keeping the tiles for a brief moment when we descovered them but I'm really more of a sober and minimalist kind of person. They were really busy!

Plus the whole concept was to have a continuity of material floor/bench/wall.

So instead we kept the tiles intact and avoided fixing the floor boards to the terrace itself. We made a sort of big flat palette that could be removed. Since the patio is walled on the 4 sides, it cannot slip away and the next person living here could uncover the tiles if they ever want to. "

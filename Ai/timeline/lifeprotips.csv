Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

Don't ever volunteer information, kids. You never know what information the other party has, and you can always give information if asked for it later.

hin36n,LPT: don't use your child's embarrassing stories as dinner party talk.

Every time she tells it, most of the time in front of me, I just want to crawl under the table and hide. However, that would give her another humiliating story to tell.

Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you have a right to humiliate them for a laugh.

I do think that telling about something cute they once did (pronouncing something wrong, for example) is different to an embarrassing story, but if your child doesn't like you telling about it then you should still find something else to talk about.

Edit: I mean telling stories from any part of your child's life at any part of your child's life. When I say child, I don't mean only someone under 18, I mean the person that is your child.

Edit again: This post blew up, can't believe how big it has gotten. Getting a lot of comments from the children (including adult children) involved but also parents which is awesome.

Im also getting a lot of comments about how this is a self-selecting sample and in the wider world, not as many people would support this. All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people?

There is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.

I don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down. Embarrassing someone to give them thicker skin is a massive gamble between ended up with someone being able to laugh at themself and someone who is insecure, or at worst fuels the fire of an anxiety disorder. I'm not gambling with my kid."

The problem is that once you start engaging with ""rage bait"" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.

You feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things.  First your anger obviously.  But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more ""correct"" than they/you actually are.  You start to fall into the trap of ""echo chambers"", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions.

For example:  If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions.  This causes the following

* You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority
* You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters
* You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing  view
* You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber)

Make a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively.  Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want.  You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you.  The people fighting back and forth online over the issues of the day are a small minority of people that represent nobody, nor are they representative of even their side.

If you want to do something (anything, be it physical, mental) just do it. By all means, extend an invite to others, but if nobody makes plans, just go do it yourself. 

Instead of asking “hey, we should go out and do ______ some time”, say “hey, I’m going to go _________, did you want to come?”

This way you already have plans to do whatever it is you’re doing, and you’re just extending an invite. Not actually basing whether you will do thing on someone else. 

Hope this helps someone!

Edit: This post got more traction than I was expecting. I’d really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where I am. I grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. From elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

They’ve had dramatic changes over the years. In high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). A decade later, I can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. It’s become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. Many middle/high school kids have LAN parties. Smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). My library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

Even though I prefer pin-drop silence, I have no issues with these changes. **It’s better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. And putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

Plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!"

I guess I can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what’s worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me.

As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper. 

TL;DR- I’ve never had two people or websites give the same advice about resumes. Everyone’s going to want it different. *Generally* in the US, the physical resume could afford to be shorter because it leaves room for conversation if called for an interview. "

Looks bloody awful over in America, those wildfires are right nasty. Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. 



1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. 


People here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes.


Firefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge.




2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with  DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS!

Please fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets,  a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat.

Wet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet!




3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way.




4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now.  Your life is worth more than stuff.



5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. 


People on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone.  Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it.  You're going to lose your house, get out now.




6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked.  Don't die for stuff.  Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets.

Stay safe America!

: EDIT :


I had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends 💪 and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much.

: POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING :

A Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be.

NEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels.

Actually I'm a chick ✌️

Large bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time.

NEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend. Wool is best on a budget, duvetyne is probably the best material available, 100% cotton towels will also work in a pinch. Never synthetic .

Wow this really blew up. I'm fucking honoured, and I'm glad to see so many people out there really giving a shit about fire safety.

My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.

I've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.

I happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip. It surprisingly saves a lot of time, hassle and effort if you don't mind working a little later. Worst case scenario most people wear a piece of clothing once and stick it in the dirty clothes basket, technically you can get away with wearing something again in an emergency. Whatever works.

egs81p,LPT: Some tips for buying a used car for people that know nothing about cars,71724,0.95,1813,2019-12-28 21:20:04,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/,self.LifeProTips,0,52,,text,False,False,False,"I’m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I’d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn’t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don’t know how many people I’ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it….ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that’s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:

1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don’t need to spend a lot, as they’ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don’t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.

So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there’s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it’s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they’re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn’t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!

Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven’t passed, then it’s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there’s a problem that isn’t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.

2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what’s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don’t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You’ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it’s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.

For reference, here’s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)

Here’s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It’s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)

If you listen closely, you’ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.

If the car you’re looking at doesn’t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don’t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you’re looking at with something like “YYYY Make Model clear flood” or  “YYYY Make Model disable fuel pump” and see if there’s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.

Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.

3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don’t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you’re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it’s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it’s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford’s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That’s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven’t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That’s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that’s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That’s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don’t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you’re SOL there.

4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it’s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.

5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they’ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It’s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that’s better. Indy’s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that’s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that’s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don’t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn’t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.

6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?

7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can’t see?

8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.

9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they’re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.

10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn’t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They’ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They’ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you’re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.

11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you’re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don’t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it’s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you’re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it’s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.

12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It’s also pretty important. You’ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it’s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that’s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it’s adding, but sometimes it’s subtracting). I don’t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.

So what you’re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it’s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You’re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find “short term fuel trim” and “long term fuel trim”. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.

Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%

Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%

Let’s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You’re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the “bank” or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one “side” so you’ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you’ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don’t be alarmed if you’re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn’t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.

When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you’ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let’s take a look at some examples on a V8:

STFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6

LTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1

So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That’s pretty good.

STFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3

LTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1

Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that’s good.

STFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7

LTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15

Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That’s not good. Walk away from this one.

Here's one more that's a littlte different:

STFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20

LTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20

Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.

Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.

Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.

13. Last and not least, don’t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don’t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you’re worried about is no big deal, it’s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it’s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn’t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don’t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.

I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents’ cars, friends’ cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you’re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won’t forget anything.

EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.

&#x200B;

EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.

There are people in this world that are freezing with a locked thermostat. This is for them. Apparently people in offices and classrooms too.

Your brain is your hype man, and tries very hard to prove you right using emotions as feedback. Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.

If your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going ""nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback."" You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain's response to the stimulus around you (emotions). Even if it is an uncomfortable situation, your brain will recognise that it's helping you achieve your goal, so the feedback it gives you (emotions) will be much more positive. It all starts with what you want to achieve and if you don't know, then spend some time figuring that out. Goal clarity is like giving your brain a quest marker.

There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already."

I posted this right before picking my sister up from the airport and packing her a slice of homemade cheesecake. She really appreciated it, as she was coming from across the country and wanted to keep her mask on until she left every public space.

To those asking why you'd be hungry after a flight, in the U.S., you don't get food on domestic flights, unless you want to purchase the world's most expensive cup of instant noodles or something similar, and that would require you to remove your mask to eat it, of course.  Between the flight time, airport wait time, and time to get to the airport, it could easily be eight hours since they last had a proper meal, even with a direct flight.

To those that are hostile towards the idea that you might consider doing an additional nice thing for someone on top of an initial nice thing: You don't have to do it, and the person isn't obligated to eat it. Sometimes it just makes me feel good to do nice things for people I care about to make them happy, especially when they've had a tough day/week/year. And aren't most people having a tough year?

Edit #2: I love all the comments from people remembering times they appreciated unexpectedly having a snack upon being picked up from the airport!

Also, despite the first edit, I still woke up to hundreds of hateful comments. To those, I add: I hope you someday experience the feeling of being excited to pick up someone you love from the airport. I hope you someday feel joy yourself when you make someone else feel happy and loved and cared for with a small gesture rather than being filled with scorn and disdain for them. It's amazing!"

In other words there were no full-time positions.

One person in our group was the smart one. When they got hired on they asked to see details of pay, benefits and the likely schedule of the potential full-time position. The job recruiter could not provide this at all. She said that they dodged this question multiple times and she knew right then and there that there would be no full-time positions given to anyone.

I felt that my problem that I was trying to convey to my friend was lost on him, and I really just felt worse afterwards.

Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

This has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

EDIT: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't MEAN that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. Either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

I am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

Edit 2:

As this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: Yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. Hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us.

They will list these jobs as being ""Event Coordinators"" or ""Marketing Associates"". It's a lie, you can find these people at stores like Costco trying to sell some useless appliance that no one wants or going door to door trying to sell other appliances that no one wants.

And the recruiters that craft these resumes are VERY good at just bending the truth enough that  what is on the job description isn't technically a lie, but any reasonable person's interpretation of the description is nothing like the reality of the position. That's why the title is what it is: if they list sales, that is what you will be doing and nothing else.

An easy way to avoid this is to google the name of the company you are applying to. Either nothing will come up or they will be associated with other companies that are accused of doing the same thing.

TLDR: Be careful which companies you invest time into when you are applying and interviewing for a job.

Edit: Something that I should have clarified is that I don't have a problem with sales jobs or people that work them. The point is that if the company feels the need to hide what the job is or lie about it on the description, something isn't right.

Also, lots of questions on what dashcam to purchase and how they work. I got a $45 dollar dashcam from Amazon. It had pretty good reviews, which is what I look for in a product. They come with a memory card, which stores the video as your drive. When the card gets full, it should automatically delete the oldest video's to fit the new videos. If an accident occurs, your pull the memory card and plug into your computer to save the video you want. The dashcam plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter. As far as I know, no dashcam records multiple viewpoints. You will need to purchase more than one dashcam if you want front, rear, and side facing dashcams. Hopefully this helps to address some of the questions I have seen.

Update #2: someone says  dash cams that record multiple angles at once do exist. I didn’t know this, but great info! The commenter couldn’t remember the brand but I am sure someone can give more info."

Turns out, it's almost impossible. There is literally almost *nothing* you can do to stop these websites from tracking your actions. I can't believe there haven't been MASSIVE class-action lawsuits against these companies before now. The current private-browsing suit doesn't even scratch the surface.

Even when you delete your Cookies, clear your Cache, and use a VPN or a browser like Brave (effectively telling websites you do NOT want to be tracked), these websites will still track & build every action you take into a robust profile about who you are, what you like, and where you go.

This goes deeper than just websites. Your Spotify music history is added into this profile, your Alexa searches, your phone's GPS data, any text you have typed into your phone, and more. Companies like Amazon and Google purchase all of this and build it into your profile.

So when you are 'Fingerprinted' by these websites, it's not just your past website history they are attaching to your session. It's **every single thing about you.**

This should be illegal; consumers should have the right to private sessions, should they chose. During this time of quarantine, there is no alternative option: we are forced to use many of these sites. As such, this corporate behavior is unethical, immoral, and in legal terms, a contract of adhesion as consumers are forced into wildly inappropriate terms that erase their privacy.

**TL;DR LPT**: You are being fingerprinted and tracked by Google, Amazon, every other major website. Not just your website actions, but your Spotify listening history, phone GPS data, Alexa searches, emails, and more are all bought & built into these 'fingerprint' profiles. Private browsing does not stop this. Don't ever assume your browsing habits are private."

While understandable, you're setting yourself for heartbreak and frustration.  It is natural to assume that the one thing we know we have to do to plants should be done often, and the more often the better, but root rot is usually not fixable and will slowly kill your lovely plant. Underwatering, on the other hand, can be fixed very easily. As a rule of a thumb, once a week is perfect for most plants. 


Missing the outdoors and ending up with about 60 houseplants through a year of lockdown, I have learned that majority of them prefer to be left to their own devices. Here is a rather conclusive guide working for vast majority of widely available plants:




- give them a sunny spot. Seems obvious, but we might be tempted to place them for aesthetics out of sun. There are plants that don't mind (ferns are the best example), but most do. Give them sun or grow light. Remember that more sun makes them dry up more often (so on a sunny window sill, water once every 5 days, in a shadowy corner, once every week)



- once every 2 weeks, take a soft cloth, slightly wet, and clean the leaves. Dust sets on them as well, and it makes it harder for them to undertake photosynthesis properly. It is also a rather soothing activity. Everyone wins. 




- get a plant food. They are usually cheap and you can also make your own, and they can make your plant grow like crazy. Don't overfertilise tho - about once every 3 months enough. Too much fertiliser is a thing, and it can burn them. Don't fertilise in the winter. 



- ⚠️ on the topic of eating, many houseplants are toxic to pets if ingested. If you have pets, particularly playful ones, make sure to research ahead to avoid trouble! 



- Don't rush to repot. I know you want to put them in these cute pots you got, but keep them in nursery pots for at least a month. Many plants experience environmental change shock between you taking them from the store and bringing them home, so don't make it harder for them, they will thank you with many happy years in those sweet pots of yours. 



- speaking of pots, always have drainage. Try not to put plants straight into a decorative pot without drainage - get a bigger planter and put it in with nursery pot and tray.




- chop of leaves that go yellow - they won't go green again, and the plant is wasting resources on it. 




- if cactuses or succulents, you still have to water them, albeit rarely. Many people recommend cactuses as the most beginner houseplants, but you can absolutely kill both cactuses and succulents, and not only as a beginner (I'll be the first one to admit I've killed a few). But even if they do not die on you, they will not look as lush as when bought in few months unless quite a lot of care is given. If you really want an unkillable plant, get a pothos or peace lily. They both droop when thirsty (so they give you a clear indication as to when to water them), have a lovely chunky foliage, are quite cheap and very sturdy. Another great ones are snake plants. Most cactuses and succulents would go on 4th and 5th place on the ""hardest to kill"" list. 





- your plant may experience a bit of a shock after about half a year since you bought it, as the fertiliser given in store usually runs out around that time. Don't panic, it is not dying, just give it a little love and plant food and it will be happy again. 



Follow these and you should be just fine for the majority of plants.



Houseplanrs are awesome decorations that can light up any place, and more than you think are extremely low maintenance. It is a nice hobby for the soul, and don't stress if you kill one, happens to everyone every now and then. Some species are drama queens, and some specimen of no-fuss plants are ungrateful bastards. That being said, most will comply, because they want to be alive just as much as you want them alive. [Here](https://youtu.be/l6huWZZaZek) is a little guide on what to expect from common low maintenance species. Good luck! 💚"

We don't get gold stars for effort in real life.

An example of what I'm talking about here is that I used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. Often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  At first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

I also noticed that I was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. People would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated I was doing it. I stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. Now I only do it if I feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

Yes, I want the person to know I was thinking about them and what they love, BUT I also want to spend my money on something they really enjoy or will actually use. Why spend hard earned income on something they’ll probably let collect dust?

I think that gift giving culture excessively pressures people into giving gifts as surprises. That combined with the social norm to always say “I don’t want a gift... just get me whatever” makes it very difficult to know exactly what people want because you can’t ask them. That’s why, IN MY OPINION, it’s fine to write someone a heartfelt card and then give them a voucher or gift card to let them treat themselves to what they want.

Ultimately it’s your choice how you want to spend on your loved ones. This is just my philosophy."

However if your about to lose a loved one whose battling a disease like a cancer be prepared for a very jarring and potentially drawn out experience. 

With my dad for the last 12 hours of his life he fought for every breath, and when I say fought I mean like gasp, cough and vomit blood and have to call emergency services. All to be told they can’t do anything except to give him more morphine. In his final few minutes he began to panic as he realized this was it. He looked at my mom, my brother and I and shed tears. Then as he slipped away his body expelled blood from his mouth. The entire experience still haunts me to this day, I remember every moment perfectly clearly and whenever I do I break down a little bit that he had to go through that. My mom will call me and wonder if she did enough, was she strong for him at the end, which is it’s own kind of heartbreaking. My brother couldn’t cope and has since become addicted to drugs.

But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

Similarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress.

It sucked watching the kind, warm, and generous man I knew become a shell of his former self.   


During his decline, he showed all the hallmarks of the disease: forgetting family faces and names, telling stories about false memories, and, in the end, a bit of belligerence (the kind you might typically see in a toddler).   


Throughout his decline, I saw my family approach it in one of two ways: some would try to correct his mistakes over and over (to no avail), and some would just roll with the punches.   


Playing along with things in the moment always seemed to keep him more centered and grounded. Not only did it help calm him down, it made those painful visits a little less so by knowing he felt comforted by my validating his reality, and not trying to yank him out of whatever timeline/alternate universe he was visiting.   


A simple example would be if he asked where his (long dead) mother was, I would just say ""she's visiting with your sister and will be back soon."" What good would correcting him do? Then he'd have to re-live that trauma of losing his mom all over again, possibly many times a day.   


Or when he would say something outlandish like, ""I used to be a senator, you know"" I would just say, ""oh that's right, I forgot all about that, tell me more!""   


I have to give credit to a [TEDMED talk](https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=526821) that I saw describing this whole approach, many years ago. I'm so glad I saw it because it absolutely changed the way I spent time with my dad, and made it easier, richer, and more gratifying in spite of the misery of the disease. Hope it helps you, too.

Any time you feel yourself start to get regularly dumbstruck during any and every argument with a particular person, remind yourself of these unethical and pathetically desperate tactics to avoid manipulation via asshat.

Also, as someone commented, a related concept you should know about to have the above knowledge be even more effective is Cognitive Bias and the associated concept of Cognitive Dissonance:

EDIT: Added Cognitive Bias, Cognitive Dissonance, and Cognitive Distortion.

EDIT: Due to the number of comments that posed questions that relate to perception bias, I am adding these basic links to help everyone understand [fundamental attribution error](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)  and other [social perception biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_perception). I will make a new post with studies listed in this area another time, but [this one that relates to narcissism](http://www.columbia.edu/~da358/publications/ames_kammrath_mindreading.pdf) is highly relevant to my original train of thought when writing this post."

About 10 years in we got into a conversation about how I find it so difficult to come up with thoughtful gifts compared to how adept she seems to be.  When I asked her how she did it, she casually said,

“I pay attention to what makes you curse!”

And I’ll be damned if the vast majority of the gifts that I found most memorable and oft-used were the direct result of the thing that guys often catch a bad rap for trying to do for others.......solving problems.

Did I trip over a power cable multiple times building out her chicken coop?  Cordless drill.

Was I always complaining about how I can’t get my pillow to support my head throughout the night?  Contour pillow.

Remarking how much I hated constantly cleaning out the gutters underneath a big oak tree?  Gutter covers.

That’s it.  Simple stuff that often doesn’t break the bank.  

That being said, of course there is room for gifts that don’t have to solve a problem and are a little more extravagant or frivolous and just make somebody happy, but I’ve put this technique into use in the years since and always come up with great gifts for the guys in my life.

Understand that this LPT isn’t exclusively for men, of course.  I think it can be applied fairly easily as long as it just comes from paying attention to your friends/family......at the very least it will make them feel great to know somebody is paying attention."

I usually can spot a scam. Today, I didn't. 
 
So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. 
 
Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. 
 
The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.

2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received. 
 

 
To clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info. 
 
1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system. 
 
2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card ""that was hacked"". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to ""lock"" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into. 
 
3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff. 
 
4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)
 
5. Lastly, thank you all for all the kind words and reassurances. It did all turn out fine in the end. Lesson was learned."

U.S. healthcare really shouldn’t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. 

They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I’ve mentioned, they’ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.
 
Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.

If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!

You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.

If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren’t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!

You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. 

Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There’s a chance you’ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.

EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there’s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don’t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no “propaganda” or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation. Many of these people didn’t get much recognition for sharing their experience either, it’s not like they’re just lying to go viral. They’re not all wrong."

Our work is paying for his college, but having him come in to make up hours he misses due to school. He's running behind on homework and wanted a day off to catch back up. I told him I didn't need any explanation. Just don't come in. He has 7 vacation days which can be used as PTO. I as the supervisor and the company do NOT need a reason for his use of PTO/Vacation time.

I'd like to thank those who posted great ideas and stories regarding their past experiences with prior jobs, Either being screwed over or helping those under them realize this as well.

I'll post some of the comments and remarks a bit now, to help stop the identical spam posts.

**-You'll Get Fired-** Is one of the most commented posts on here. Yes, there is always a risk of getting fired, But if a company wants to fire you for using your PTO or Vacation days, then is that really a place you want to stay at? 

**-Only Privileged People can do this-** As seen below in quite a few popular comments, Privileged people get way too many PTO/Vacation days and can bargain for more. Those who are less privileged rarely get time off. Jobs such as retail claim you can schedule unpaid days off, then turn around and deny them, forcing you to use their trash point system, until you're forced to come in every day or get fired. 

**-As a XXX This advice doesn't work for me-**  I understand that some fields, such as Military, Teaching, Railroad, etc, can't take time off due to either contracts or legal reasons. However, this post wasn't fully intended for your positions. There are a lot of young adults out there that work at retail or fast food jobs that are getting screwed over by their management and scheduling teams. I faced the same thing when I started working years ago. This is just personal advice I wish I knew when I was younger.

**-It's Vice Versa, Not Visa Versa-** Alright grammar police, I'm not a robot. I make mistakes just as well as everyone else."

I'm 48 years old. A little over ten years ago I was in the car pickup line at my daughter's school. She was in second grade. It was a warm spring day so we were all standing around outside our cars. This chubby guy was standing outside an orange Mini Cooper. I nodded and made the random nice car comment. He said its name was Oliver. Oh, like Hammond's car in Top Gear? His eyes lit up. Friendliest guy in the world, he came over and we started chatting. Found out we had nearly everything in common, and were best friends from that moment forward.

It's so rare to make any friends in your 30s with a family, much less a best bud. Our daughters were the same age and were immediate best friends too. Same with our wives. It was weird, we were all so much alike and got on so well. I helped them move, Joe helped me with some projects at home. We went to see Deadpool about a dozen times.

Last summer Joe, in his early 40s, had been having some stomach issues for a few weeks, then passed out at work. They did tests. Found a sizeable tumor in his colon. Chemo. Surgery. Complications. Another surgery. Another. More chemo when the last surgery found that the cancer had ""spread significantly.""

Joe was brought home from the hospital a couple days ago to be put in hospice. My wife and I are going over to see him later this afternoon.

To say goodbye.

I'm loading up a couple episodes of Top Gear on my tablet and am going to just sit with my buddy one more time.

Guys... Get checked. Get your colonoscopies. If something doesn't feel right, go to the doctor immediately and get it checked.

-----------
Editing to add because it looks like a common question. I'm no doc but I saw a GI doc comment that the current recommendation is for all adults over 45 to get a colonoscopy, potentially earlier if you have family history. 

And thank you everyone for the kind words. Wife and I are about to head over to Joe's. Gotta hold it together for him. I can cry in the car afterward.

------------
Evening edit. Got to sit with my buddy for awhile. He mostly slept. Woke up a couple times and held my hand. It was good to see him and remember all the laughs. Made it home before I bawled my eyes out."

EDIT: Apparently this is a sore subject with some people! You \*PROBABLY\* don't hate vegetables, but individual tastes and physiologies differ of course.

The real value of the places outside of the material support they provide is that they've been there!

Did you just move to a new state and are considering reporting abuse by your parents but don't know what the foster care system looks like in you new state? They do! Can you open a bank account without a parent, etc. - they likely know! They also take calls from siblings, parents, extended family, kinship placements, child welfare workers, etc.

**There are 5 very important services funded by the RHY program.**

**Basic Center Program:** Shelter program which includes counseling, trauma-informed care, life skills, and other help. Usually for kids under 18, depends on the state.

**Maternity Group Home Program:** Shelter for youth with kids, must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, child development, parenting help, budgeting, nutrition, etc.

**Transitional Living Program:**  Must be between the ages of 16 and 22 to enter the program. Life skills, job help, nutrition, budgeting ,etc.

**Street Outreach Program:** My favorite program. Outreach workers meet youth where they are at on the streets, in parks, etc. These outreach workers adjust to whatever level of support you need- they could just drop off food and warm clothes or they could help you access emergency shelter and sign up for health insurance.

**National Runaway Safeline:**  1-800-RUNAWAY or [http://www.1800runaway.org/](http://www.1800runaway.org/). They were an actual switchboard back in the day that would allow kids to contact their families if they ran away. Now they have forums on their website where thousands of kids ask a ton of questions FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD about how to be safe. They work with Greyhound to provide bus trips home for runaway youth and also do a lot of outreach around issues concerning runaway and homeless youth.

""Until recently, the latest research developments have concluded that sleeping has much more impact in the brain than previously thought. More specifically, when one sleeps, the brain resets itself, removes toxic waste byproducts which may have accumulated throughout the day [2]. This new scientific evidence is important because it demonstrates that sleeping can clear “cobwebs” in the brain and help maintain its normal functioning. More importantly speaking, this paper illustrates the different principles of sleep; starting from the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to the behavioral as well as mental patterns with chronic sleep loss as well as the importance of sleeping acting as a garbage disposal in the body.""

Edit 2: Yes I agree. Not just Quantity of sleep but Quality of sleep matters as well

Edit 3: Amount of sleep required varies from individual to individual

Edit 4: For people saying nobody says that. 
My mom did. I followed the 6 hour thing for very long till I realised, that wasn't true and I needed 7 hours. I used to wake up at 4.30 AM to push more hours of studies ( after 6 hour sleep) man let me tell you. I was extremely sleepy and tired in class. I stopped doing that later. Couldn't keep doing that.

When I was a teenager, they never let me sleep over 8AM, even during summer holidays.

About Boss and Coworkers....In 5 months I'll become a doctor. Healthcare, depending on your speciality and job is one sector where sleep and mental health is actually ignored. I see my interns/ house surgeons staying awake   36 hours. Sometimes the job requires it. Night duties are a part of the job. Even during our undergraduate it's considered very normal to lose sleep over studying for tests and exams. Most of them sleep hardly 3 -  5 hours before  University exams. It has kinda become the norm. And yes I've heard my own friends bragging about how less they slept the previous day. It's pathetic.

In our student life these kinda extreme situations happen before exams and our exams go over a month.

When we don't have exams, I keep my sleep the highest priority more than my studies and try to eat well and exercise. I'll take the stress when I have to, just before the exams.

During internship, half the interns I see are sleep deprived and stressed.

Brings me to another point. It's not possible to have a good sound sleep all the time, but we can have good sleep atleast most of the time."

For a lot of cases, I'll add more bags: an oxygen kit, a resuscitation kit, an airway bag, sometimes specialised lifting equipment. We carry a lot of stuff, and generally the more I carry, the more concerned I am about the person I'm about to assess.

It's a very natural reflex to welcome someone to your house by holding the door open. The actual effect is to stand in the door frame while I try to squeeze past you with hands full. Then, once I've moved past you, I don't know where to go.

**Instead, it's much more helpful simply to open the door and let me keep it open myself, then simply lead the way.** I don't need free hands to hold the door for myself, and it clears my path to walk in more easily.

Maybe you didn’t send enough, maybe the washer is broken. Maybe you didn’t label correctly. Kindly point it out and someone will explain or rectify the problem. 
4. Food gifts are almost always allowed, just be sure to check with nursing staff first. If your loved one is on a low-sodium diet and you keep bringing them McDonald's, that's a yikes. Also be careful about sharing with other residents. Your loved one's roommate might be on a special diet and you keep giving them french fries and we can't figure out why they're not feeling good.

I have now worked in a geriatric psychiatric ward too- and these 90 year old women who have literally been assaulted by their once-loving husbands at 2am have to hear your fucking bullshit about how they can’t care for their spouse and what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ use your brain. Maybe your grandma insists that she needs to get to the bus stop at 4pm, right when you’re getting home from work every day- do you want to quit your job because she can’t stop wandering into the street? Can you afford a loving, caring facility that provides a lock on the door and 3 square meals every day with 24/7 nursing care? THEN BY ALL MEANS, GO TAKE A FUCKING TOUR OF IT AND SEE IF IT’S A GOOD FIT! THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE ALL FIT FOR DEMENTIA CARE.

As the program director, I am in charge of scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating the activities. I either lead the activity or I delegate it to an aide who works in the afternoon. I interact with and update the families as necessary or on a schedule. I come up with creative solutions to behavioral problems and advise/inform staff and management on layouts of how to address concerns resulting from cognitive impairment. I work closely with the nursing staff to coordinate the best care with behavioral interventions paired with the pharmacological interventions. It's a huge team effort. Takes a village."

Edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. For some extra help / elucidation:

-	I found this very helpful when I was starting my career. The biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out “on paper” to better see where things need to change, where I didn’t know all I could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	I am indeed now a director. Our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. It’s those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; I can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. As a manager, it’s a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I’m never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it’s because they’ve found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	Most importantly, where I’m from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they’ve been forced to “work themselves out of a job” then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it’s not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you’re in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren’t so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I’ve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. I guess as a second tip - if you’re working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it’s time to find a new company to work for..."

Our 2nd cat had kidney failure.  Daily IV fluids at home, pills twice per day.  Became super skinny.  She developed pancreatitis which is apparently (to humans) so painful that people are hospitalised as the only treatment.  We did not know until it became very obvious.  Ran her to the vet.

It took 2 lessons, but now I know that **extending a pet's life by extraordinary means is selfish on our part, when they have a mid to late stage terminal illness**.  We just want more time with them.  But we may be causing them pain without realizing it.

v4ct0a,"LPT: If your employer puts you on a performance improvement plan or suddenly starts asking for daily reports out of the blue, start looking for a job",50809,0.89,2170,2022-06-04 05:47:30,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/v4ct0a/lpt_if_your_employer_puts_you_on_a_performance/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/v4ct0a/lpt_if_your_employer_puts_you_on_a_performance/,self.LifeProTips,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"In most U.S. states, the amount an employer pays toward unemployment insurance is affected by various factors, and one of them is how many employees have collected unemployment insurance in the past.

And in most states, if an employee is fired for cause, and the employer states the firing happened because the employee didn't meet the job requirements or didn't do their job correctly, the former employee might not be eligible for unemployment insurance.

The result is that in a lot of toxic corporations, management will sometimes set up some of their employees for failure. They will for instance put them on a so-called [performance improvement plan](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/exreq/pages/details.aspx?erid=586), or start micromanaging them to death, documenting anything that can be perceived as failures or mistakes using brand new standards. It can also be implemented as part of a [vitality curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve), where bottom performers are regularly purged from the organization, regardless of the company's results.

It's also sometimes implemented in perverse manners when a company is looking to lay off a percentage of their workforce, and managers are instructed to meet a number within their reports. Some employees, identified as financial liabilities because they might work in a support quality but not directly generate revenues, suddenly see their performance reviews peppered with what were in fact minor issues, but that were inflated to turn them into causes for firing.

And if the employee is fired for cause, they might not be eligible for unemployment insurance, reducing the unemployment insurance tax the employer will have to pay in the future.

Bottomline is this: if an employer suddenly starts playing this trick on you, where you were performing just fine but are now having to jump through hoops, it means your ass has been put on the chopping block. You've been set up to fail, and you will almost certainly be fired soon. Start looking for a job. The good news is that unemployment rates has rarely been this low.

EDIT: Some people in here rightfully pointing that a PIP is not some evil tool and that it can be used to help a struggling employee to succeed. This is not the scenario this LPT is about. This is about the all-too-common toxic workplaces where PIPs and other processes are used to push out employees who were performing well simply because a manager or the company wants to reduce expenses, avoid a lengthy or costly separation, or downright discriminate."

I was shocked, and unprepared, when they told me I had heart failure and they me immediately to the ER. Upon getting out of the car at the ER, I grabbed the USB power cord we keep in the center console. There was no waiting room (due to Covid?) - just a glassed in reception area. They took one look at the EKG from Urgent Care, and took me to an ER treatment room and started working on me. At that point I was tethered to the bed with IVs, so even a short 110v power cord would have been a problem. I asked the nurses, repeatedly, for help charging my phone.

Don't ask HR for help. Make them.

Get evidence. Document interactions. Get things in writing. The more you have as proof of whatever your complaint is, the more HR will have to help you. If you show them you have proof that will support a lawsuit, they will do everything they can to make sure it doesn't need to happen, and the easier it is for us to justify it to our bosses. 

Help us help you.

Everyone likes to focus on their glamour muscles like shoulders, arms, and abs. While strengthening your abs and core is important, your future self will thank you for strengthening your foundation. 

I’m about to be graduate from medical school and I can’t even begin to describe how important it is to have a stable spine, hips, and knees. People in their 30’s, 40’s, 50’s, and up all complain of having constant back pain. Most of this isn’t caused by things are degenerative disorders (while that can most certainly be the case) but mostly due to a sedentary lifestyles leading weak muscles which further causes joint instability and increased disc and cartilage stress in those joints. 

I’ve seen so many elderly people come in with backs that look like question marks and people in wheelchairs due to severe osteoarthritis in their knees and hips. The best way to prevent this down the road is to strengthen the muscles around joints to give them stability and strengthen the bones themselves through weight lifting.  

The key is to just stay active and try to incorporate exercises or stretches that strengthen your back, hip, and knees. You don’t have to go out and try to deadlift or squat 350lbs. Rome wasn’t built in a day and neither will your muscles and joints. Sedentary? Start with a walk and gradually build from there. Kind of active? Hit the gym and train these muscles. Start slow and light and get used to the movement. Then slowly increase weights. FOCUS ON FORM NOT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT.  Don’t have a workout partner to check your form? Ask one of those jacked dudes at the gym. They have been some of the nicest people I’ve met and are always helpful. (I’m scrawny as hell so it was intimidating the first time not going to lie) Just get moving.

If you’re not sure what exercises to do, try to find physical therapist run websites that recommend exercises for certain muscle groups. The goal goal isn’t to  like Hercules. It’s to invest in your future quality of life. 

TLDR: Exercise, stretch, and strengthen your back, knees, and hips. Start slow and don’t be afraid to ask for help. Your future self will thank you for it. Remember the goal isn’t to look like Arnold in his prime. The goal is to be healthy and active and live a quality life."

The fire department has the means to enter a building and the tools to open the elevator.  Often times there is no maintenance team on site.

Edit 2: HOLY LORD. I went outside to garden and came in to this. 15k! Front page! I was so afraid to post publicly about this, and the fact that my first outreach touched so many people in any way is genuinely healing me right now. Thank you so much, Reddit. With that, I'm pretty sure mods deleted/locked the post because I mentioned another dog-related sub in my text.  I had read the rules before posting and didn't know it was wrong.  I'm sorry and it's been removed.  

...

Hopefully this can get back up, but it seems hilariously appropriate for me to make a technical error on my first viral post when so many of you have reminded me of the technical solution of ad blockers for my original issue.  To clarify: I do have one installed on my pc, but I am not very tech-savvy and ads still pop up here and there (especially on mobile which I use predominantly.)  I suppose I could have done a better job of troubleshooting the problem technically... but when I had this idea and tried it, I genuinely found happiness seeing ads for puppies in raincoats instead of non-stop babies.  I still appreciate the advice, and will keep learning how to be better at both Reddit and the internet in general :)

But mostly... if this does get re-posted and anyone reads this... *thank you.* I feel like something beautiful just came from the saddest few days of my life. I know it's just internet karma, and I know it's not ""real.""  But it *is* made up of *real people*. And you very real strangers made this girl feel a whole lot better today."

ilrdua,"LPT: When negotiating a salary for a new job, always ask them what their range is. If they tell you 'we don't have a range' they're almost always lying. HR and finance will almost never sign off hiring a new employee without a budget being in place.",48787,0.92,1530,2020-09-03 16:39:32,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ilrdua/lpt_when_negotiating_a_salary_for_a_new_job/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ilrdua/lpt_when_negotiating_a_salary_for_a_new_job/,self.LifeProTips,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made as possible. The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.

Once you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.

However – and this is the important bit – if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.

To get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.

(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a £6k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers – all above the original top end of their budget).

Now the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.

If the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful – especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process. Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them.

And even if that isn't the case, consider carefully whether you really want to work for a company where there is a culture of lying to you before you've even been hired."

Westfield is a chain of shopping centres in the UK, AU, & US. In the moment of panic, I went to the bathroom, I realise too it probably wasn’t the best space to go.

I was at Westfield pretty late writing my thesis paper \~23:00, and after I got up to leave, I noticed the only other guy in the area leave as well. Typically I'm the only left because I stay back past dinner and had thought he would naturally just leave when all the restaurants closed (Westfield closed at midnight, and all shops were closed.) I got some creepy vibes from him so I walked some loops from L3 to L1 and he was still following me. I went to the bathroom to calm myself, spent about 20mins there and called an uber (normally I walk home because it's pretty safe at night, but I felt if I left the centre where there were no cameras it would be safer to catch a ride). When I came out, I thought I must've spent long enough in there, and he had left but he was sitting on a bench obscured by the elevators ahead. I walked past him as discreetly as possible, towards the parking lot but he got up and followed me too. So I went back round to the supermarket, the only place I knew would still be open and walked around aimlessly until I saw a couple walk in for some late-night grocery shopping. I was afraid to inconvenience them but ended up asking if they could accompany me whilst I waited. I explained I'd been followed and didn't feel safe, and if they could walk with me to the car park where my uber would arrive. They agreed, and once it came, I thanked them and yeeted out of there.

If I had walked home alone maybe something bad could have happened to me, maybe not. All I know is that I didn't feel safe. I don't know who needs to hear this but don't let politeness or fear of inconveniencing someone - it could be stranger, adult, or friend, to stop you from seeking help.

Addressing some comments: Some have mentioned they've encountered similar situations and received no help from the person they asked, I understand the embarrassment that may be felt, but it's alright to ask another person. You know you are more likely to be in danger than you are a danger to others.

Not American, so I wouldn't have protective equipment as it's not legal for the general public to carry them; I didn’t confront them because I didn’t know how they would react and could possibly incite them to harm me; no crime happened so I didn’t think of calling the police, but now I know if the police are willing to escort, it’s valid to be escorted.

Edit 2: There seems to be a lot of fussing and feuding in the comments, so I'll address that. A university lecturer here in the UK is simply someone who teaches at a university. I know in some other places we are called ""professors"", but that's kind of an inaccurate term, since we are rarely professors in terms of our qualifications. A professorship in terms of the qualification comes after a doctorate. I personally have a doctorate, and thus my title is ""doctor"", but that's entirely different to a MEDICAL doctor (M.D), which I am very much not. At any rate, you don't even need to be a doctor to teach at a university here in the UK, just someone experienced in the field you're teaching in (my doctorate isn't even remotely related to games development, which is what I teach, for example). I wonder whether people are thinking I'm claiming to be a medical doctor or something? My doctorate is in a subject related to medicine, but I am not qualified as a literal MEDICAL DOCTOR, as in someone who can treat you in a hospital and prescribe medication etc. Do I sound that intelligent to you?? Trust me, I'm not XD

Maybe people are confused because a doctorate simply means you've completed a doctorate (often called an ""academic/research degree"") in the UK? Anyone can apply to do one, and universities frequently publish requests for people to apply to undertake them. In my case, I was required to take an MPhil (Master of Philosophy) course before I began the doctorate. That's pretty standard since I didn't have one yet, and someone else was funding my doctorate application.

If you want more information, shoot me a message and I'll provide proof of this all. I'm not posting it out in public.  "

We're now selling our house, and the distance to the station has more than halved - the house is now listed as being 0.27 miles to the station! The agent thinks this has boosted the price of the house by a few %, and has resulted in strong interest from Londoners moving out to our town

e0eqyz,LPT TIPS: What you should never to bring to a dry cleaners,47209,0.91,1317,2019-11-23 13:02:29,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/lpt_tips_what_you_should_never_to_bring_to_a_dry/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/lpt_tips_what_you_should_never_to_bring_to_a_dry/,self.LifeProTips,0,12,,text,False,False,False,"I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

EDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

DOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

COMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

SPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

WEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

LEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&#x200B;

WORTH IT:

MEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

WOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

D/C Only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.

Oil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

Also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

Bottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  If your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself."

My wife’s 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee was recently rear ended. After having about $5k worth of damage repaired, I filed a diminished value claim. Progressive Insurance (the insurance of the person who was at fault) offered me $400. I said no. They then offered $600. I said no. The body shop who fixed the car recommended an independent appraiser who they said almost always gets you more money. I paid him $300 for an appraisal report that showed that the value based on auctions etc is between 2-3k. I sent that report to Progressive. They reviewed it and then had their appraiser do their own research and then contacted my appraiser to negotiate a “settlement”. We agreed on $2100. 

The independent appraiser told me not enough people know about diminished value claims. He said if you have a later model car with under X miles (varies by state), it’s a no brainer claim but never accept the insurance company’s offer because they will low ball you a lot until you bring them evidence otherwise. All this cost me was $300 and 45 min of my time to have the appraiser see and take photos of the vehicle.


EDIT 1: As someone posted below, the ability to get a claim does depend on the make and model of your car and it's value. I should add that the independent adjuster I talked to gave me a ballpark value of what he thought the claim should be before I ever paid him a penny. He did say in some cases, it may not be worth it but knowing the details of my car (age, mileage, condition), I was getting low balled. You mileage may vary.

EDIT 2: As many have stated, Diminished Value laws vary by state so please check state laws before filing as to not waste your time (or money). Every state may have different time frames for when you can file. 

EDIT 3: This is based on my experience in America. I have no idea how this works globally outside the US, if at all.

EDIT 4: wow. Did not expect this to blow up like it did. As I stated above, you mileage may vary, it varies by state so do your homework, and my experience was specific to the US. I didn’t know about this and my first experience turned out to be a positive one. Some of you are screaming that these claims are worthless and you rarely come out ahead. Everyone is an adult and can make their own decisions about what to do. I’m just providing the tip because it worked for me so like all tips in life, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t."

**There are a lot of prestigious jobs that are way more stressful than people think from the outside** and are also not a good fit for most personality types, yet so many people want them. Also, prestigious institutions rarely are highly ranked based on how well they treat their employees and having a non-toxic work environment - in fact, it's often the opposite. 

**Prestigious institutions are often less focused on employee retention** because they know people want to work there just for the name and that, if you leave, there are so many others lining up for your job they can spare you easily.  It doesn't matter if you are a brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins, an Astronaut at NASA, junior faculty at Harvard, or an endangered species veterinarian working for the World Wildlife Fund - you are expendable and you will likely be working with a bunch of people driven by pure ambition.

e5iz4j,"LPT: Teach yourself to not touch your face throughout the day - you’ll get sick less, as hand to face/mouth contact is one of the most common routes for microbial transmission.",46388,0.9,1678,2019-12-03 21:18:53,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e5iz4j/lpt_teach_yourself_to_not_touch_your_face/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e5iz4j/lpt_teach_yourself_to_not_touch_your_face/,self.LifeProTips,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"EDIT: Some information to prevent myself from having to facepalm in response to some of these comments.

For a complete overview of the pathogenesis of the rhinovirus (a virus responsible for the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses) check out [this article](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/pats.201006-039RN). Some key excerpts are:
- “The most common way to ‘‘catch a cold’’ is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.”
- “It is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.”

Hence, this LPT. It’s based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one’s hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes). 

The study ""Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study."" specifically concludes that ""infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands"" led to a ""substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection"" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk). 

In the article ""Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu"" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like:
- ""To infect someone, these particles don’t have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface — eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!""
- ""Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can’t stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes.""

A 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled ""TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES"" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected. 

The 2015 study ""Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers"" states ""person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes."" and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.

I could go on and on but I think at this point it's on the Redditor to do their own reading."

Explaining the positive impact of your employee’s actions allows your boss to understand more of what your team does. It also forces you to think about the positive impact in a way you may not have. 

And this process makes it easier for you to recommend your people for raises/promotions/other recognition because you’ve already helped build/spread a positive reputation for them. 

Then save the email (and your boss’s response, if they respond) in your employee’s personnel file to refer back to when you’re writing their annual performance review or award!

Edited to add: Do this for things they do that are exceptional - not ‘thanks for how you always show up for work on time’ but ‘thanks for saving that valuable client who was about to leave but you discovered how to resolve their really complex issue/working with another division to share your expertise to help them build their new process that will help the company reach x more people/that great interview that the governor personally commented on, it made us look really good”

Also, know your people. If they are embarrassed by direct praise, then just praise them behind their back to others. If they prefer quiet recognition or a cash/time off reward, do that.

And if they do always show up to work on time, and that’s notable, mention it to them. Don’t cc others or exaggerate how big a deal it is; on the other hand just because it’s their job doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be recognized for it. “Hey, just want to say I noticed you’re always extremely punctual; may not seem like a big deal to you but it says a lot to me about how you respect other people’s time.

You should start a small garden. Even if you live in an apartment, a small garden can help lower your food bill, and relieve stress on the nations food transportation chain.

If you live in an apartment, you still can have an indoor garden. You place it in front of a sunny window.

This year could spell food prices, that some people will have to decide, to eat or to pay bills. This can help you do both, and food that grows in the garden nourishes you and is healthy. So grab a pot, plant a tomato vine, and watch it grow so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor :)

Edit: many people are missing the word ""shortages"". This LPT prevents shortages, as well as lowering costs.

We see our parents as parents, not people. And for most of childhood that is essentially a service role - they do things for you, you take things from them.

I'm now in my 30s and I realized I only knew a few select moments in both of their lives before I existed. A couple of highlights, but nothing that really painted a picture about how they came to be the people they were as adults. 

So a couple of years ago I asked them both to write down their story for my birthday. Of course, this was a difficult request for them - getting me some socks or a couple of books feels way more comfortable. But I pushed them on it, helped manage their expectations and made it clear I wasn't expecting Ulysses, and stood firm on the request. 

One year later and my birthday comes around again and this time I got the presents I asked for. Instantly read them cover to cover (I mean, one was 4 pages typed up, and the other was a small handwritten book, so it didn't take too long for either of us), and they were so amazing. So much stuff I didn't know about them both. And not just events, but feelings, attitudes, perspectives, and insight into them both as people rather than just parents.

So this is my LPT to you. I am lucky enough to still have both of my parents, but quite a lot of my peers do not, and it really makes me appreciate that I still have the time to do this.

Walk into a hotel lobby like you know where you’re going and go to the restroom. 

If you can’t find it quickly, find an employee and say “ I need to use the restroom really quick, but don’t want to go all the way to my room. Can you point me to the lobby restroom?” 

As long as they have one and you don’t look homeless, it will work nearly every time. 

I’ve used this all over the US and Canada in many, major large cities.




Edit 1: As many have pointed out, the first option is to just walk in and go straight to the restroom like you own the place. Being confident and acting like you belong somewhere will get you into a lot of places you otherwise wouldn’t. The example I gave has variations to it and there have been some solid ones mentioned in the comments. You can typically read the hotel employee pretty quick and get a sense if you can just ask or if you’re going to have to get a bit more creative to get access.

I was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*


Edit 1

**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


Edit 2

**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  Especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**Moisturizers & Chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/FatJennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  I will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing."

No one did anything alone and just going out in town you were bound to run into someone you knew) 

It seems like for people who grew up in the city this is common practice but for many this is unheard of. So if you are someone who needed to hear this I'm glad I could help."

Rip currents are not always like the areas mentionned in the title. Also, I'm not the most knowledgeable on the subject, please read about it on specialised websites.

People often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. However the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

It is way easier to see with [an image](http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). If you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. 

[**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

[**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

[**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. 

[**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)

I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...

It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

[**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

[**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**Bonus Tips That I Learned**


***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying. 

***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.

I'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out! 

**Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!

Good luck in your studies my friends!

EDIT: Cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions. Also added Flu.x per KreekyBonez as it is one I think people should be aware of. 
_________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: Thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than I expected! Glad to help. Wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.

I hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. Otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course!

irgh41,LPT: There are other search engines than Google's. You can choose to protect your privacy or plant trees while you search.,44061,0.88,1223,2020-09-12 22:40:08,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/irgh41/lpt_there_are_other_search_engines_than_googles/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/irgh41/lpt_there_are_other_search_engines_than_googles/,self.LifeProTips,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"Some of my personal choices in alphabetical order:

[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) doesn't track you, simple as that. Downside is that it doesn't know you, your preferences and so on. But that's kind of the point.

[Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) plants trees. Based on Bing. Has been my personal choice for years. Sometimes when I'm not satisfied by the search results I type in #g to be redirected to Google, which in my experience is very seldom more fruitful.

[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is quite useful in academics. If you're not sure how to cite a source in e.g. APA-style, Google scholar helps you out.

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is supposed to be really good for answering (numerical) questions. Plots functions which is nice. Haven't used it much for some reason.

There are many other alternatives, so if you know some specific search engines that you find helpful, please let us know in the comments!
Wikipedia also has a great [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines).

Another matter is Google translate. Depending on your language it can be less than perfect. [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) does neural machine translation and has much better results. It only translates Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. It's pretty good at translating English to German and vice versa. I don't have a clue how the performance is in other languages though. Let me know if there has been some kind of breakthrough in translating Finnish.

Shouldn't forget maps. Google has great satellite images and street view. [Bing](https://www.bing.com/maps/) often has better aerial views. Check out if there are better local resources that have e.g. topographic maps which are just on another level, especially if you hike or are prone to getting lost in the woods. Get a compass while you're at it. I love maps in general btw. So [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) has to be mentioned. It's collaborative and non-commercial. Check it out and help to make it more precise locally!

English isn't my first language, and I'm also a grammarnazi, so please point out any mistakes that I made. +Shoutout to the Ask Jeeves crew! Yes, you are old, but maybe a bit wiser too. :)

EDIT: Oh my, over a thousand comments now, can't interact with everyone anymore. Thanks to everybody that has joined this discussion! To address a few concerns about me basically advertising for Ecosia. That's a valid critique, and now I feel a bit naive about well, kind of advertising for them. Commenters have come to my rescue in a way by confirming (with sources) that it is indeed a legitimate enterprise that uses the money they make to fund others that plant trees. Don't believe me, check it out yourself. I'm not their freaking spokesperson. I genuinely like to use it, and that crept into my post and maybe it shouldn't have. We have to live with that now. Oh, and their tree count is approximate. Go and count the trees at their different projects and update the database if that bothers you so much.

Next! Basically every online translator engine uses neural machine translation. WolframAlpha is not a search engine, but a computational knowledge engine, which understandably is a bit different to the former concept. What else? Oh, I actually was about to include bing/videos (for your preferred sexual practices), but left it out because I wasn't sure if it is still relevant. According to some commenters it is. So happy masturbating to everyone! Anyway, there haven't been many comments about alternatives, in search engines is what I mean. I would have made a list, but the wiki list above is pretty extensive anyway. I have to say that I'm amazed that my little thought has sparked such a great and civil discussion amongst you guys. Lots of love to all of you! Be critical, choose your search engine wisely, and don't listen to what I say."

Replenishing? I said yup. He then laughs and said with a wave of his hand they're doing it all wrong. I started laughing and he said I guess you experienced it too. I said yup. I told him I'm always prepared for disaster just in case. He laughed and said if it's not one thing it's another it can't hurt.

Also, as far as an explanation for ""stale redundancy"" goes - I would define it as a state in which no new data is coming in, so your mind just recycles what it already knows to a point of redundancy until it loses interest. I would liken it to playing a video game over and over again after completing everything there is to do in it. Eventually you'll get bored and will want to do something else. New information about your ex (such as if she's dating again) would be akin to the developers releasing new DLC for the game. It's going to give you a reason to play/think about things."

I can’t speak for every organization, but I hope that I can address a few of the general concerns that I see now so that you feel more comfortable calling.

1.  “Why did I get put in a queue? Do they not care that I’m about to kill/hurt myself?”  We absolutely DO CARE! Please, please stay on the line.  At my organization, when you call you first talk to a “crisis screener” who’s job it is to take down whatever information you want to give them and then send you to one of two queues.  One queue is for people actively wanting to commit suicide and the other is for people in general crisis but not suicidal.  This is where some people get stuck on hold for a while because we are actively taking calls from the queue as they come in.  Every night is different and every shift is different. Sometimes I’ll get 3 calls in 4 hours and I can really take my time with each person.  Other times, we have 10 people waiting in the queue but I still want to give each person their respective time to de-escalate.  We can also see if someone has dropped from the queue and it always makes me sad to see that someone hung up.  I want to talk to you. We all want to help.

2. “Workers just talk from a script so there’s no point in calling”.  This is absolutely not true.  When you talk to me, I’m given a blank notepad and that’s it.  Through extensive training, we learn about ways to help you de-escalate your thoughts, open up and feel comfortable, and help you specifically identify what you are feeling in a crisis moment.  Our onboarding teachers really focused on how every caller is different and every situation is case-dependent. I would never boil down your experiences to a script. 

3. “I don’t want to call again tonight because I’ve already called once and I’m going to bother them”.  Please feel comfortable calling as many times as you need if you are in active crisis.  Most likely you won’t even be talking to the same phone worker as everyone goes into the same queue.  I would say about 50% of my calls are people who I regularly hear from every day/week - they say their name or I recognize their voices.  20% are likely callers who have already called once in the night and need to talk again.  This is perfectly fine and I’m happy to explore what worked for you last time you called and what can work again this time.

4. “They’re going to hang up on me”.  We are not allowed to hang up on anyone (and I wouldn’t want to) unless they are being abusive to us or won’t let us speak.  We get a surprising amount of prank calls and people who call just to scream at us.  THAT BEING SAID - I have accidentally hung up on people before.  I feel absolutely horrible when this happens but I hope that everyone knows that they should call back.  If I am actively talking to you or you are telling a story and we get disconnected, know that I didn’t get bored and hang up. Something definitely happened on the worker’s line.

5. “I don’t want to call because they will record what I’m saying and it will be used against me later.”  From my knowledge, most privately and gov owned phone lines do not record phone calls.  Some that I am unaware of may have different standards but at least with the ones I’m aware of in my state and National level, we all make it very clear before your call that we are 100% anonymous.  We don’t record conversations or calls - I don’t even think our phones can do that.  Most times I take notes so that I can remember your name and specific hardships that you mention but we have shredders all around the office to discard those after we hang up.  You are also welcomed to not disclose your name if you have something really personal that you feel scared to let out.  If you are ever unsure about what is being recorded, please ask your phone worker and they will tell you what your organization allows. 

6. “My problems are too big for them to handle”.  We have heard everything, trust me.  Everything from teens wanting to shoot up their schools to people who are having affairs to people calling us so that they can masterbate.  Nothing you say will surprise us or be too much for us to talk you through.  

I’m happy to answer any more questions in the comments if you have additional things that you are curious or unsure about.  I greatly recommend that you print out your local crisis line’s number and hang it on your fridge and enter it to your phone.  You have no idea how many calls we get from children/teens who got our number from their parents/friend’s parents either directly or indirectly.

If you are looking to find a hotline in your country, please refer to this link: https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html.  I recommend if you are in the United States that you look up a free, 24 hour hotline in your city or state (rather than the National hotline) as they will be more likely to have a smaller queue and can also give you strong resources within your zip code or area.  You can save this number for if you are having an emergency.  Never hesitate to call the National hotline either, though which can be found at that link.

Please call us.  We are ready and eager to help.

Edit:  concerning mandated reporting to 911 because many people are asking about it, every organization is different.  For mine, we are mandated reporters in cases where people are in active suicide or planning to hurt someone else.  We don’t call the police but we do call 911 and we have no control over what they decide is best in that situation (whether they should get cops involved or just emergency services.). However people saying that they feel suicidal is far from being in active suicide.  Even people that have access to suicidal methods, like if someone has a gun or pills in their home, we will not call unless they are actively trying to use them to kill themselves.  De-escalation is our main priority.

That being said, if we do need to call the 911, my call center and certain others have no way of knowing where the caller is since we are a 100% anonymous call center.  Some organizations may have trackers or can give your number away but we either have to convince people to call 911 themselves so that their location can be shared or we have to talk it out of them.

For example, I got a call one time from a lady who had just taken a bunch of sleeping pills and just wanted someone talk to while she died.  Through about 20 minutes of conversation I was able to get her to tell me where she was located and so emergency services were sent.  This is pretty rare and it only is required maybe once every couple of months.  Many people are sharing stories of themselves getting hurt by police and thrown into mental wards. I know that this is common and this is why my organization really doesn’t call 911 much.  Again, I cannot control if the 911 operator decides if the police should be involve or not and if this does happen if you get taken to a psych evaluation at a hospital.  My job in that moment is to save your life and remember, it’s not a choice - I’m a mandated reporter to 911 which means I’m required to call.  I try HARD AS HELL to prevent this from happening though but some situations are dire.  I really recommend asking whatever hotline you are calling what their mandated reporting requirements are or looking on their website under terms and conditions where it is laid out in writing.  

Most times if people are in very bad mental crisis that we cannot completely de escalate in a 30 min call, we can offer to send a mobile crisis team to your location. This involves sending two trained mental health professionals to an address that you give us and consent to them coming out to.  This is fairly common and probably happens around once every two hours on the line but it still not the most preferred conclusion.  We work very hard to help you on that phone anonymously and quickly.  I wouldn’t want anyone to be turned away from getting help because they’re scared about what me as a phone worker is going to do.

If you are ever concerned about what is reported, being recorded, etc... please ask your phone worker.  We are legally required to be transparent to you.  Thank you!

Edit #2:  here are some additional answers to questions I’ve been getting in the comments:

1.  “Should I still call the line if I am just depressed and not suicidal?”  There are two different types of lines that I wish were spread around more clearly.  One is a suicide-only hotline.  These workers will only answer and respond to people who are actively suicidal or having suicide ideation right now.  Many of the negative stories in the comments have people saying that they were hung up on because they weren’t “that depressed”.  I can’t diminish your experience and I’m sorry that it happened.  In the future, if you know that you are not actively suicidal but still need someone to call, call a “crisis hotline”.  These are also trained volunteers and workers who deal with general crises.  Things like if you are depressed, having anxiety, want to vent, need to cry, need to get resources for drug addiction or domestic abuse etc... this is the place to call.  It’s also okay if you call the crisis line and later end up talking about suicidal thoughts, it happens more than you know.

2. “How do I get a job as a phone worker or volunteer?”  The way I did it was that I went on my local hotline’s page by searching ones near me on google.  There was a tab that said volunteer and I filled out my email and a small application on there.  Within a week, a supervisor reached out to me and asked me to fill out more information involving sending them my resume, filling out a 4 page document on why I want to work there, and undergoing a background check.  Another week or so later, I got instructions on how to join an orientation where they told me more about the work and we could choose if we were still interested or not.  After a year of being a volunteer, I applied to a bachelors-level paid position at my hotline in which I oversee other volunteers if they have questions or concerns about calls.  My organization has bachelors and masters level positions.  I got my B.S. in physiology.

3. I want to say thank you to everyone who is sharing their bad experiences here as well as their good ones.  It’s important that organizations learn from people’s shitty experiences so that we can all get better as a whole.  I’ve been suicidal and have attempted in my lifetime.  I’ve called a suicide hotline and had a bad experience where I felt like I was wasting their time. I also called a couple times after that and was connected to the best people I have ever had the experience talking to.  They saved my life.  I applied to help because I want to make sure that everyone has a good, or atleast fair, experience when they are speaking to me as a phone worker.  

There are a couple of things that I recommend if you want to get the best chance at having good experience calling a phone line.  For one, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, National phones lines have longer queues and they are likely rushed as phone workers.  They’re not a bad resource at all but if you are of sound mind, I recommend searching and saving a smaller hotline’s number around your area that deals with suicide or crisis that way you can have them in your phone when you need them.  Next, if you are concerned about if giving away your information will be tracked or reported... ASK.  Always ask so you never feel like you were duped into having the cops called on you or your address taken.  Ask if your call is recorded, ask if your number is recorded, and ask if you can even remain anonymous.  I don’t care what information you give me about yourself, I care about helping you get through tonight.  Many of this information can be found on your hotline’s website under the terms and conditions. Read through these if you don’t want to ask.

—————-

I have taken a break from this account indefinitely.  I don’t know what some of you want from me. I made an informational post based on MY experiences as a phone line worker and told you all of my knowledge on how to have the best chances at a good experience because often people have bad ones.  I’ve called 911 on probably about 5 people in my whole career because they already took active measures to end their life or were planning on ending someone else’s soon.  They also knew that I was going to call and GAVE ME THEIR INFORMATION AND LOCATION because they realized that they needed in-person and immediate help that we cannot give them.  I didn’t “swat them” or “send police to their door for no reason”.  I understand that this may be a rosey organization that I work at but the advice I gave to ask questions, call smaller hotlines, and read the terms and conditions still stand for any hotline you are calling.  Take a look at their website and understand their protocol. 

People have been messaging me that I should kill myself, that they hope I get cancer, that I’m the reason their father/mother died, I’m the reason they got sent a 20,000 dollar medical bill, I’m the reason they were trapped in a mental health facility for 7 months, I’m the reason they got beaten up by cops, etc... How can you say these things to another human being and then complain about how your own mental health was treated?  I’ve been blamed for the actions of a huge line of decision-making people that I don’t even come in contact with at my job.  I’ve been blamed for the actions of people at other organizations who I will never meet or talk to in my life.  I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation as stated in my post, and frankly, the comments attacking me have brought up a lot of that which is why I need to go.  I’m not upset that people have had bad experiences and are sharing them, that is inevitable and encouraged as I have also had bad experiences and we need to learn from them. I’m upset that people are messaging me really horrific things and attacking me.

I still want people to know that there are good organizations out there filled with people who want to help.  I know the comments here seem overwhelmingly negative but, often people who have had good or life saving experiences will not comment.  Not all hotlines are good but I hope, if you need it, you will still try to find one based on my advice above.  I wish I could bring all of you who have had bad experiences to my line and let you listen to the constant stream of people that we help for 8 hours a day, but I can’t and I realize that asking you to trust me after your personal, horrific experiences is too much to ask.  I hope that you all have found a therapist, psychiatrist, support group, or other healthcare professional or service and are working to heal from your mental health issues.  I’m still doing so myself."

I love this tip because it is a simple way to make sure you can be helpful without being socially awkward! 

For example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. 

On the other hand, if you say “oh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering” or “you’ve got a huge pimple”, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it’s just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.

Hope this helps someone! :)

EDIT: wow, didn’t expect this to take off so fast! So, just for clarity - 20 seconds is a rough guide to indicate a relatively quick and easy fix. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a minute, just use common sense as to what the situation is, if you know the person etc.

Also, if someone has shit/wet/bled somewhere, or something of that nature, discreetly tell them and offer help to get somewhere to fix themselves up.

Basically, be a decent human being. If you’re close to the person, then you should be able to judge what to say and when based on how you know they will react and process it."

I listen to their problems, try to come up with solutions and I don’t judge or tell them they’re less of a man because they can’t solve it themselves. I’m not worried of crossing some imaginary boundary of ‘that’s gay’ because I already am. 

It’s really obvious to me - no matter how old these men are, they’re never too mature of a man to ask someone else for help. They might think they do, but I’m here to tell them that it’s ok to feel sad or vulnerable or frustrated with not living up to the standard of what a real man is. 

And the result of all of that is these men reward me with their trust and friendship, and as corny as this might sound, there really is a sense of accomplishment when you uplift someone’s spirit, at least that’s how I feel.

Treat your fellow men better, because you deserve it, and they do too."

As hard as it may seem at the moment.

Tough day at work. Managers being mean for no reason.

Someone bullies you. Calls you names.

Family or friend arguement.

Find a weird lump on you that sets you to panic mode instantly.

Virtually anything in your life that sets you to a state of mental discomfort.. **(not literally dying guys if you are dying go get help immediately).. Im talking about controllable moments.. Not physical pain or mental problems. Like the ""karen yelled at me at work"" problems.** Do not prey on the thoughts immediately. Do not lash out or panic. As much as you wanna run to your mom and cry, Accept that it has happened. Put your emotions away. And as hard as it is at the moment, move on from it, sleep the night. Tomorrow come back at it with a clear mind and approach the problem. However youd like. But now your mind is in tune properly.

[[This is nothing related to death or physical pain or serious life problems .. just your day to day encounters awkward moments arguments the little stuff]].. THIS IS NOT 100% SCIENTIFIC FACT. THIS IS NOT FOR SITUATIONS UNCONTROLLABLE LIKE PHYSICAL PAIN AND MENTAL DIAGNOSIS. This is help for Karen type moments day of stuff. You will not feel better the next day. You will be able to react better the next day is all i'm simply saying. Controllable moments.

I took a few yoga classes and watched a few videos to figure out poses that would improve my flexibility and strengthen my back and core. When I started, doing a simple standing bend I could barely get my hands past my knees, and now I can almost get my palms flat to the floor. I learned to focus on my breathing, and stretch into the pose and not strain. When I started, I could hold a plank for barely fifteen seconds, now I can easily plank for three minutes.

For your mind, it can be anything. Reading, doing puzzles, taking an online course in something that interests you. I started learning German because I had always been interested in the language but never spent much time on it.

Edit: Disclaim/Disclaimer/keypoints:
First of all Im not writing this for the lazy ones, a lot of comments telling to work hard and get out of the poverty line, obviously this LPT is for the hard workers, minimum wage workers you name it.

Second, I'm not discrediting the struggles, hard work and achievements of people who escaped poverty or wealthy/comfortable persons. You did well I congratulate you.

Third, there are parents and hard workers out there who probably died poor, but they have children that is very successful, can you blame them?.Vincent Van Gogh died in poverty but he is one of the greatest painter do you think its his fault?. Just because you are stay/died poor it doesn't mean you are a failure remember that. You may have a lot of hidden achievements in that poverty line.

Last.
Bill Gates once said if you're born poor it's not your fault, but if you die poor it's your fault. 

Well this sounds motivational, but poverty is not a choice due to many factors(privilege, education, health, opportunity, proper guidance ) especially if you're in poverty line since birth. 

The poor are most likely the most hardworking people around. (3rd World Countries)..Think of our garbage collectors, factory workers, janitors, tricycle drivers, ice cream vendors etc. If they even attempted a day with these folks, the bourgeois would simply melt in the sun.  

They are simply fighting for the right to lead better lives – with a roof over the head for starters. That’s an indication that nobody wants to be poor. We who are privileged need to be considerate.  It is irresponsible to blame the vulnerable for their mishaps in life. 

That is because nobody wants to stay/die poor."

When the interviewer asks the question: what salary are you looking for?, instead of listing what you’re expecting ask them instead. 

I always start with explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about experience to “this position”). 

Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. 

This also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of under selling yourself! (If they’re expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they’re not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).

Edit to add: a bunch of commenters are making valid points. Do your research, know your worth and what the worth of the position is. If the company lowballs you, ask for more if you feel comfortable. Salaries are often part of a negotiation, and if you know you deserve more then advocate for it. Prove to them that you’re worth the investment, because if they’re not willing to pay you what you deserve (provided they can AFFORD to do so, some businesses just don’t have the funds to meet the same pay as another business) then you have to consider if they’re worth your time. Does the money matter for you to accept the job, and if the answer is yes then get it!

So when i was 10 years old (13 now) my dad passed away of a stroke.

It was a rough 3 weeks and school was a total mess. I finished my year (year 6) and we decided to move to another city. So during year 7 I was still pretty messed up. My grades went from pretty good to really bad. I finished the year with 18 pts (pretty bad-ish for Switzerland) the next school year is a big year academically. You need to get 20 pts to get into VP (Voie Prégymnasiale) basically sends you automatically to college/HS (idk lol) once you finish 11th grade. 

Anyways I realized that nothing that I ever did or say would bring my father back. So after grieving for what seemed like and eternity I decided to make him proud instead of failing.

Here’s how I did it.

After my worst year in school ever I went back in and started to put in some effort. I paid attention, I studied hard at home. When exams where approaching I studied like never before. (4+ hours every day) I got very good results from this. Finished the year with 21 /24 pts and got into VP.

I also had to deal with a new school and I had to try and make new friends which was not easy.

In summary:

In the beginning it will hurt. A lot. But overtime you will learn that it’s more important to shoot for the sky’s rather than fall to the ground. I kept my motivation and dignity to help myself and make my father proud.

In the end it paid off.


Edit: Wow! I did NOT expect that to do so well. Words could not express how grateful I am to see the response in general let alone the awards. I’ll try my best to respond to all of you but no promises. Thank you so much.

Edit 2: so apparently my message didn’t really come across the full way. Yes a dead person can not feel pride, my point is:

Make yourself proud and do what you think is best for you and do what you *think* would make a deceased loved one proud. This (in my case) worked for me but every person has their different way of grieving and their different way of going about things going forward. Also try your best to pull yourself up no matter how hard life throws you down. I know some people just can’t because of their own guilt or sorrow but at least try.

If you fail I wish you can one day succeed in all of your endeavors and dreams.

Oh and to all of you people that live to downvote comments that make me feel *actually* better

Seriously, fuck you."

Ladies and gents, give your guy the physical love he probably gives you. Touch his hair, hug him often, let him lay his head in your lap and just caress him. He deserves it and it's time to normalise men craving physical attention besides sex as well!

Edit because you people are absolutely right: bros, give your bros hugs, show and tell them you love them! Men are not machines and want to feel loved by their friends, family and SO.

Another Edit, because again, the comment section has offered great advice: obviously, not everyone is into physical love, platonic or otherwise. As always in life and love, consent is super important. Nobody can know what kind of history a person has and what kind of affection they enjoy!

Also: it's perfectly fine for men to be the little spoon or to be held affectionately. As someone in the comments stated: it doesn't make anyone less of a man to want to be held. It also doesn't make a woman less of a woman if she's the big spoon, as long as everyone is happy, everything is fine!"

Our house is relatively new yet the downstairs gets frigid, my wife mentioned that the windows felt drafty yet they were solidly shut.

After using it to find all the weak spots and rechaulking along with fixing some door insulation and closing a flue the house is much more comfortable.

Bonus: you can aim it at pans/foods and tell temps within a few degrees (surface only of course).

Double bonus: Aim it at your SO and say you found something hot.

Edit: the LPT is be aware of the inflation rate when discussing raises with your boss. It is a strong negotiation point. One your boss can’t argue.


For those of you who have stayed with the same company through this pandemic or even just for the past year. End of year is fast approaching and it’s time for performance reviews & raises.

The inflation rate this year is 5.6%. This is very important for those of you working in corporations that like to put out flat 2% raises or cap raises at 3-4%. Companies adjust their prices regularly to account for inflation and should adjust pay as well but it’s not in their interest to do so. Many will try to use excuses that “be happy you got a whole 3% that’s more than most/I even got” or even “you got a whole 4% RAISE. That’s huge.”

But the fact is 5.4% is just to maintain. If you get less than a 5.4% raise you are getting a pay CUT and if you get a 5.4% “raise” they are just paying you the same as before. Your company may be struggling or needing to cut back and unable to give you more. But you do need to be aware that even if they are giving you a token “raise” it is a pay cut.

The practice of giving/accepting 2% flat raises is why people find coworkers getting hired for more than them after a few years. It’s because you have been accepting pay cuts every year.

Edit: my apologies the data I looked at didn’t was a month out of date the inflation rate is actually 6.2% as of October.

This is for US. Every country has its own inflation rates and rules around it.

Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

The things I have in mine include:

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

\- Iodine tabs for water

\- Beef jerky

\- Energy gel

**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*"

Edit: Great advice from /u/OA27


>Furthermore, document the encounter to the best of your ability. This is not the time you want to shoo someone away immiediately. Be comfortable being uncomfortable and without escalating the situation, ask as many questions as you can. Who are you with (even if they lie, they likely have told that lie before), contact numbers, etc. Did they come in a vehicle? Take the plates down, make, model, any damage to the vehicle. Which direction did they go in, did they talk to any neighbors.

Aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.

Also agree from a health standpoint, the better LPT is probably to eat fewer chips :-P But nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.

Know where your emergency exit is and how to use it. My kids learned how to open and unlock a car door as soon as they were old enough to understand they should only do that when the engine is off.

As they get older - I will teach them that this extends much wider than just locations and physical objects. It extends to religions (any religion you can join but not physically leave safely is a cult), relationships (my kids know - you always need a bank account in YOUR NAME ONLY with enough money to live on for at least a month; possessive relationships are a HUGE red flag; you NEVER stay in a relationship where someone even loosely implies they will kill you or themselves if you leave - having the conversation early in the relationship about how, if it doesn't work out, you will respectfully go your separate ways is really important), jobs (never sign a contract with a non-compete clause that would ruin you or prevent you from earning a living wage), etc.

The only thing in your life that (I would argue) shouldn't have an emergency exit is your relationship with your kids. As they grow, they obviously need to become independent, and Once they reach adulthood, they need to be able to pull away from you entirely if they choose to - but you need to be there as a safe and stable base for them if you possibly can be.

This will largely discourage them to do it again, the best thing you can do is just thank them for doing it. 

There are several reasons for this; It is way easier to do a chore if you're not told to do so, as you don't have the pressure to do it, you just decide to. Thanking your child will make them feel way more accomplished for doing the chore.

In fact in general the tasks and chores you do tell them to do ALWAYS thank them afterwards.

Thank them for doing it as if its the norm. I disagree with the offering of gifts every time they do it, as it will make them used to it. And it should be normal to do unsolicited chores."

Keep your dog on a leash at all times in public. For everyone's safety, including your and other dogs.

Edit: lots of great comments below. Some awful stories about off leash dogs. Wanted to address a few points that have come up in the discussion:

For those confident in their dog's training, a leash is most likely to save your dog's life, not anyone else's. Your dog is more predictable to you but you have no idea how other dogs or people will react. With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.

A leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.

Exercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you. Go out to remote hiking trails. Running around in your local public park isn't nearly enough.

And retractable leashes are terrible. They teach the dog to pull, and you can get some nasty injuries if they get caught in your dog or your leg."

* How can you not recycle? It's easy! Planet murderer!
* What do you mean you don't exercise regularly? It only takes like 30 minutes a day? Why are you so lazy?
* How can you eat meat? A vegan diet is an easy adjustment, you monster.

And so on.

The thing is, it doesn't matter how objectively awesome and beneficial a thing is, everyone has limited pools of time, money, interest, and willpower. It's great that you bike to work, champ! But try to remember it's not just ""10 minutes on a bike"" it's

* Getting a good bike and a place to store it
* Having good gear
* Learning the rules and regulations involved in using it in your area
* Having the energy to get up early enough for the extra time to prepare for a bike trip
* Having a shower or place to change at work (and having to actually change at work)
* Having a place to keep your bike
* Having to take the bike home no matter how late in the day, how the weather has changed in that time, or how exhausted and awful work was that day.

Basically, people vastly oversimplify what THEY like or do because the downsides either don't matter to them or they forgot they existed due to their lifestyle. As another example, I saw a former marine judging people for being ""lazy"" because they didn't regularly exercise. Meanwhile, I know people who are struggling to have enough energy to cook dinner instead of microwave foods at the end of the day due to kids, physical issues, emotional issues (depression for example). And what if someone just hates exercise while you personally don't mind that much (or love it) ? Doing a thing is much easier when you naturally enjoy it (or had some kind of life event that let you overcome your dislike or motivated you more than average to overcome it).

The point is that something that you can easily slot into YOUR lifestyle may not work so easily for someone else. Don't judge someone who's struggling with crippling debt and money management for not being charitable like you. Don't look down on someone who has computer trouble just because you like computers and it's easy for you to learn the ins and outs of computer security. Don't judge people when you don't know their limits and capabilities.

EDIT: This guy's comment really helps put it in perspective: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/pegs3q/lpt\_learn\_to\_accept\_that\_others\_dont\_care\_about/haxh0nr/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/pegs3q/lpt_learn_to_accept_that_others_dont_care_about/haxh0nr/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Bottom line, there are a million ""causes"" and banners people gather around, and judging people because they're not under your banner is missing the point that you're not under theirs either. And even if someone is under no banners, there might be a very valid reason for that too. Try not to judge people you don't know or understand.

Most likely situation is that if you push yourself to your limit to be the best employee in the world and make the company you work for rich, you’ll see very little, if any direct benefit to yourself. Most of what you produce you don’t see (surplus labor value) and the good job you do; It’s not uncommon to see that just taken credit for by people above you - so don’t be exploited. Your reward for hard work will very often be more hard work unless you negotiate or are willing to walk. 

You only have one life, and you don’t want to kill yourself trying to climb a ladder that, statistically, you won’t ever climb. The United States consistently ranks pretty low on most economic  upward mobility metrics - that’s just a statistical reality. Granted it’s better than most 3rd world countries but…hey, perception is everything I guess. 

Regardless, an employee who will run themselves ragged for as little money as possible is every companies dream - but it’s an equal exchange of labor for payment - what you get in that exchange matters too. 

Do the minimum to not get fired, or at least, a well enough job -  and enjoy your life. Put your friendships and family first, don’t define your life by working. 

You will be a lot happier that way.

Work bullies might prey in these initial weeks. They will try to tarnish your image in the team and destroy your self-esteem to enable them in exploiting you. It is also more common for senior co-workers who exploit their positions of power to show such behavior.

How to tackle this:

1. Best way is to show confidence when you are sensing such a behavior. DO NOT APOLOGIZE unnecessarily. Instead try saying ""Oh so this is how it's done, no one told me this. Thanks for highlighting it, is there anything I should keep in mind?
2. Ask questions from start, be vocal. Do not let the bully think they can talk over you and shut you down.
3. These are hard things to do, some bullies are too manipulative and will corner you down. Seek mentors/colleagues at work who believe in you and build you up.

If you are someone actively being bullied:-

1. I am so sorry you are going through this. It is really hard when someone exploits you at your weakest.
2. Seek out your friends and tell them what is happening and how you feel. Sharing helps.
3. You might have to work on building your confidence for long term, but the best immediate option is to start over or a new job. Such toxic work cultures are not worth your time. If you are still stuck there and cannot because of monetary or other reasons, remember to remind yourself of your achievements and how far you have come, do not let these bullies make a dent on your self-worth, because that's what they prey upon.

There are people out there who are proud of you seek them. But the proudest has to be you :)

**Edit1**. I see a lot of people commenting how this is a school thing and are surprised by the term work bully. I know bullying is a big topic in schools in USA, but anyone can turn into a bully. It's the sudden access to a position of power that makes them a bully and corrupts their basic decision making skills. **Example**: A Supreme leader of a country in asia, just cause he is a president he believes that whatever thought that comes to his mind is truth by the god, but anyone can be a president(at least a lot of people) it does not make you special, or messiah of god himself and you should not exploit this position of power. I hope these insights helps you in understand this issue better.

**Edit2**. I also want to highlight if you feel baffled on how this still happens, maybe you are part of privileged group where people respect you just cause you look a certain way or are from a certain gender(Hint: most of the industries are male dominated with gender biases). Not everyone is blessed with a safe upbringing where they build up a rock solid confidence and have an amazing support structure. I hope these insights helps you in understand this issue better."

Reverse image search to find the real product name and manufacturer name & then you can much more easily find it somewhere else - often for cheaper.

Let's take a lamp for example:

* **[""Mailiah 29"" Table Lamp"" by ""Highland Dunes""](https://www.wayfair.com/lighting/pdp/highland-dunes-mailiah-29-table-lamp-w000784812.html?piid=627550410) on Wayfair** ($127.99)


But when you [reverse image search](https://www.google.com/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZisaBUOrMWZcFrSm36J185qOshtSbrdWKbbo9-bfBDOUONL88hhDMOD6SRMU-JbLDiCMLcVaaMwJrA3mrmohpChd_1wEJaipToQaUkGCk4lgni-psKtXJe1dkf_13XWTrOeKYfcz_1OVJqy9bKnBJQhNXrAgKW5_1iqx5td1fY0E3DkexFSTSsk_1sjQaHvB09kdnhw6nJh2ROuk5kfu3XbKIH6pee1UxPbYB0mFZcwXSkGY-SwbRPjG1Qz8B9uEl0W1OyhryGnplXzA0yBa0Md1jdFTEsAGikpk8Rp6GjtoDkBCAl93TDgS1qBCLTQ0_1R9C67kV5jprOFj3Qg6tQoighWh3yA8Vq0A&hl=en) you'll see it's really called:

* **""Ollie 29"" Table Lamp"" by ""Catalina Lighting""**

Now that you know the real name, you can easily see it's sold at [Walmart ($105.59)](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Catalina-Lighting-Catalina-Ollie-29-3-Way-Clear-Dimpled-Glass-Table-Lamp/41235796?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=1812&adid=22222222227028874167&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=61668264369&wl4=aud-393207457166:pla-97832547369&wl5=9007924&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=102975322&wl11=online&wl12=41235796&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAjwqJ_1BRBZEiwAv73uwEyE9OE-2CA2Dx835PkSd7aGkrmVdI_Sa5zUv4NR7DVtXgPJV-JWQRoCalcQAvD_BwE), [Overstock ($105.59)](https://www.overstock.com/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Catalina-Ollie-29-3-Way-Clear-Dimpled-Glass-Table-Lamp/16291018/product.html?refccid=RTVGTIFQWA7ZBFKAGSD5DQVGBU&searchidx=0&lowestPriceOptionId=27045503&kwds=Catalina%20Ollie%2029%26quot%3B%203-Way%20Clear%20Dimpled%20Glass%20Table%20Lamp&rfmt=), [Kohl's ($203.99)](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2612423/catalina-dimpled-table-lamp.jsp?skuid=77383726), & [Amazon ($105.59)](https://smile.amazon.com/Catalina-Lighting-19144-000-29-inch/dp/B00MYC0R2S/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=catalina+lighting+ollie+lamp&qid=1588098101&sr=8-1).

Edit 1:
Here are a few methods to reverse image search. I'm sure there are more.

Desktop:

* Right-click an image & select ""Search Google for this image"" (maybe this only words in certain browsers, not entirely sure)

* Or you can use [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) & click the camera icon to upload a pic or paste the URL of the image


Mobile:

* Use Chrome and hold down on an image & select ""Search Google for This Image""
* Use the Google app & open Google Lens
* Use [tineye.com](http://www.tineye.com)

---

Edit 2: Added the current prices for that lamp since prices will change in the future.

Also a couple more notes:

* Some commenters let me know this practice is called ""white labeling."" I'm assuming it's legal because the suppliers agree for Wayfair to do it when they agree to sell on Wayfair.

* This doesn't always work; sometimes Wayfair has it cheapest. So you can also try this tip the opposite way if you're about to buy something at Target/Home Depot/Macy's/etc, you can reverse image search to see if Wayfair has it cheaper under a fake name.

* Wayfair creates their own photos/renderings sometimes, so you may need to try a few photos.

* Since Wayfair, Joss & Main, AllModern, & Birch Lane are all owned by the same company, they often offer the same product on multiple sites with different prices. Sometimes the names are the same, sometimes different. So be sure to check their other sites too before purchasing.

    For example, this 5' x 8' rug is on all four sister sites:

    *  Wayfair: [Handmad Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug by Wade Logan](https://www.wayfair.com/rugs/pdp/wade-logan-handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-w002904453.html?piid=836378768)  - $143.99
    * Joss & Main: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.jossandmain.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $158.39
    * Birch Lane: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.birchlane.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $144
    * AllModern: [Walmsley Gray Area Rug](https://www.allmodern.com/rugs/pdp/walmsley-gray-area-rug-a000204971.html?piid=2002933957) - $150

    So you may think you're getting the best deal at Wayfair, but reverse image search helps you find that it's really called the ""Lefebvre"" rug made by a company called ""nuLOOM"" & you can easily find out it's sold at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/nuLOOM-Lefebvre-Casual-Braided-Salt-Pepper-5-ft-x-8-ft-Indoor-Outdoor-Area-Rug-HJFV01C-508/206984584), [Target](https://www.target.com/p/braided-lefebvre-rug-nuloom/-/A-51692002?preselect=51529119#lnk=sametab), [Kohl's](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2851085/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-terra-solid-rug.jsp?skuid=63960126), [Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/pd/nuLOOM-Salt-and-Pepper-Indoor-Outdoor-Coastal-Area-Rug-Common-5-x-8-Actual-5-ft-W-x-8-ft-L/1001110766), [JCPenney](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/nuloom-braided-lefebvre-salt-and-pepper-rug/ppr5007334058), [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/nuloom-festival-braided-lefebvre-area-rug?ID=10572683), & [Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-braided-rug-in-black-white/3321002?skuId=77145577) for anywhere from $111.92 (Home Depot) to $367.20 (Macy's) - in which case you'd obviously go with Home Depot."

Before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. Thus, our ""true personality"" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

Before that happens, people are often ""in lust"" rather than in love, but without realizing it. Our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young. This can lead to our relationship decisions in high school and sometimes college being based on biological urges rather than compatibility of personalities.

So don't worry if you can't find a partner in high school or even college - the good times are still ahead of you!

EDIT:  Getting messages saying it is bad advice to advise not to call 911.  Let me be clear, you should call 911 for their advice and on which hospital you should go to, and if the person can't walk, obviously they need an ambulance.  But in my specific case, my parents live in the country so we would have been waiting AT LEAST 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, precious time to assess and load my dad into the ambulance, and then drive back into the city. In my case, it made sense to just load up and go, but we probably should have had 911 on the line while we were driving.

Prologue:  I worked at a hospital that is a stroke center from 2010-2014 as a grunt.  Dad is a retired doctor.

I went to my parent's early on Christmas Eve 2020, was helping dad put heavy stuff in the attic.  Afterward, he said he needed to vacuum but could not say the word ""vacuum"", and then said ""am I having a stroke?""   I thought, ""fuck"".  Then he said vacuum, and walked to his bedroom, and I hoped it was just a brain fart and he was fine.  Nope, he comes into living room and sits down in chair, and he can't speak.  At all.  He points to his mouth. No facial drooping.  I later learned he meant he was drooling.  I thought, ""fuck, fuck, fuck"".  I knew he was having a stroke.  Mom walked by, I said ""dad is having a stroke"".  She said ""no no no,"", and gave him an aspirin.  I said we can't wait,  we gotta go to the hospital now.  Got dad into the car and had mom drive to the stroke hospital I used to work at, in about 30ish minutes from onset of stroke.  They gave him the TPA protocal.  They said he most likely had the stroke due to him being in Atrial Fibrillation, which fired off a clot to his head.  He went up to the ICU that night, Christmas Eve.  He was able to speak that night.  The next day, Christmas Day, even better.  He was released on 12.26.20, able to speak very understandably with only a slight defect that should go away, because the neurologist said he should recover fully.    
    

If they can walk, don't wait on an ambulance, throw them in a vehicle and get them to a major hospital ASAP.  It would probably have been at least an hour longer wait if we had waited on an ambulance.  Ideally, know what your local medical facilities are known for (heart, stroke/neurological, children, etc) and where they are so you can make an educated choice about which you should drive to.

-----

EDIT 1:  Woke up so grateful to see that many people are seeing this info.  My dad told me once he was able, ""you saved my ass"", so hopefully this info will allow you save someone else's ass.    

EDIT 2:  Per u/SquiddlyGiggly, giving aspirin is a no-no because it can make the stroke worse.  Good to know, I'll pass that info along.  I think my mom gave him aspirin because my dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64 and she probably thought he might be having a heart attack and just couldn't speak due to being out of breath.  Which leads me to...    

EDIT 3:  My dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64.  He said his blood pressure has been fine even without medications, so he stopped taking his medications for his heart awhile ago.  And apparently he was right about not having heart blockages or high blood pressure, but those aren't the only heart worries it seems.  I thought he was still getting checkups, but I learned after this that he has been refusing to go see his doctor.  If he had, perhaps they would have caught the Atrial Fibrillation (A Fib) and treated it before this happened.  My mom thinks this was a blessing because hopefully it will be a wake up call for him to take ongoing checkups seriously.    
    

So one more thing to add to this LifeProTip, show your family members this story and the importance of getting checked out and addressing issues before they become worse.  Dad said another stroke patient came in while he was there, and the guy was basically a vegetable.  Remind family that they may be ready to die, but are they ready to live with permanent handicaps like not being able to speak or use half their body.    

EDIT 4:  I just remembered a stroke patient I had when I worked at the hospital.  Guy was late 40s, maybe early 50s, looked like he was in great shape (thin body type) and like he worked a manual job.  He was laying there with his eyes closed and not able to speak, just grunt.  I ""think"" that was his 2nd or 3rd stroke, progressively getting worse I think.  Anyway, my point is, do not judge their age or outer appearance as to whether they can have a stroke.

Don't want to work the trades all your life? No worries. A good job in the trades can help you pay for community College and avoid crippling debt, or at least allow you to pay for rent/food/books as you do.

Are you POC/LGBTQ+ and worried about racists and homophobia? They're out there, but most good companies don't care, and most people in the trades are solid folks who just want you to not get them injured and show up on time. The nost grizzled fucking guy is ever met was superintendent on multi-story buildings who would break anyone in half, took no shit, gave respect, and spoke openly about his husband. God help anyone who gave him any homophobic crap because they probably can't talk.

The trades represent a different kind of economic power, and a lot of respect. Not kidding. 

My good friend D, a lesbian, wanted to become an electrician but was worried about being accepted. It took her about two days to realize she was more than welcome and could live that dream. 

She bought her first house two years later. Sadly, she died of breast cancer this past February but she went out having lived her dreams with her love by her side. That's what economic power and stability can do for you.

She just came to me and told me about how her AP English teacher tried to pull a fast one on the entire class.

&#x200B;

I've had it happen to me before as well in my bachelors.

&#x200B;

Teacher changes the syllabus to either add new rules or claim there was leniancy options that students didn't take advantage of. Most of the time it's harmless but sometimes it's catastrophic to people's grades.

&#x200B;

In my case, teacher tried to act like there was a requirement people weren't meeting for their reports. Which was not in the original syllabus upload.

&#x200B;

In my sister's case, the english teacher was giving nobody more than an 80% on their weekly essays. So when a bunch of students complained and brought their parents, he modified the syllabus to act like he always gave them the option to come in after school and re-write the essays but they never took advantage of it. One of my sister's friends was crying because her mom, a teacher at that school, was mad at her for not going in for the make-up after school.

When confronted about this not being in the original syllabus, he acted like it was always there. My sister of course had the original copy downloaded and handled it like a boss! Now people get to make up their missed points and backdate it.

&#x200B;

Sorry to all good teachers out there but not all teachers are as ethical as we'd like to think.

&#x200B;

Edit:

AP English is in high school, it's an advanced placement class equivalent to a college credit. Difficult but most students in there are hard working.

&#x200B;

Final Edit:

The goal of doing this is not to catch a teacher in their lie, the reasons to make a folder dedicated for a class from day 1 and keeping copies of everything locally are too many to list, they include taking ownership, having records, making it easy for yourself, learning to be organized, having external organization, overcoming lack of organization in an LMS, helping you study offline, reducing steps needed to access something, annotating PDFs, and many more. The story here is teachers getting sneaky but I have dozens more stories to show why you should do it in general for your own good."

The probability of someone in a spur of the moment doing 4 left turns with you is extremely low, either they will fork off at a intersection, enter a driveway, park in the street, make a u-turn or simply continue straight.

In the past 8 months it's been 6 red tick coonhounds, a dozen pits, and now two Great Pyrenees.

See, I live behind some woods that happen to have a highway on the other side. People drop them off on the road, drive off without a second thought. I bet they think they'll go live a golden life on a farm. Spoilers: they don't. They get ate by wildlife, they turn feral, they get shot, or they go to the shelter and get put down. I have seen purebred dogs, dogs with toys, dogs with perfect coats, well fed dogs, ect on top of the ones you expect. The beaten, broken bait dogs that are unwilling to die. They all have turned up on my back door.

I post the flyers, I post on local Facebook groups, and without fail I'm forced to house them and re-home them. The shelter has a 90 percent kill rate, people buy dogs with taxes or on a whim, they get big or old or whatever, and they get dumped. Now it's almost tax season and the local pet stores will be sold out for weeks on end. And in a few months I'm going to have a flood of dogs on my property. I'm going to have to start eating the feral cats that get dumped just to afford this shit (joking).

Thanks for reading, though I imagine most in this sub wouldn't abandon their dogs. It just pissed me off waking up to two 6 week old puppies a few weeks ago that had been dumped.

Edit: the two great Pyrenees have been adopted out to a local farmer. They're going to spend the rest of their days with 100 acres to run on and a thousand head of cattle to watch over. It's an ideal fit for that breed.

This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:

The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.

Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.

If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified ""even in the middle of the night"". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.

&#x200B;

EDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:

This is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. 

The ""Do not, in any case"" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple ""sorry for your loss"". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.

The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how ""anything"" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up. I was just making a point."

Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

Everything letter-shaped nowadays is processed by machines at approximately 30,000 pieces per hour. That’s slightly less than ten pieces per second.

Writing “process by hand” doesn’t help, unfortunately. We legit don’t have the staffing to fish your individual letter out of the pile. In fact, the vast majority of letters are never touched by human hands or seen at all until they are delivered.

It's human waste (Urine and Feces). Gambling addiction is a serious issue that doesn't garner as much attention as it should. Many addicts wear adult diapers or pull ups so they can continue to play without needing to get up to go to the bathroom. Their addictions are so severe that they are willing to put themselves through what most of us would consider one of our worst nightmares. The workers at the Casino are not even allowed to confront someone defecating right in front of them (at least not where I worked).

Sometimes, If you take a good look at the stain, it becomes obvious that it is human waste. There will be two butt cheek marks on the chair with the waste forming around where the person was sitting. There will also be a stain right up the middle of the butt cheeks.

This is an issue in the poker room because they use regular non leather office chairs in these areas. Typically, slot machine chairs are protected with a material that repels liquids. This is because the chairs are attached to the machines and can't be removed. I worked for a few months as a custodian at a Casino and one of my daily tasks was pulling 5-10 stained chairs from the Poker floor  and using a carpet extractor with a handheld extracting attachment to remove the waste from the chairs. We then dried them out over night and returned them the next day to replace newly stained chairs. The Casino I worked at is a lower populated area. If it happened at my Casino, it happens at yours...

Update: apparently not an issue at all casinos. Maybe just lower income areas? I am sure other casino workers will continue to comment and add info. Great discussion!"

If a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
It take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. That is if all the stains came out on the first try. Most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. And that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
Usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. They have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
In summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
Before, it was possible cause Perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from Perc by now, especially in California. 
So if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (I've been in the business for 16 years. )"

igycgt,LPT: Keep a list of gift ideas for the people in your life,34788,0.94,570,2020-08-26 18:28:50,LifeProTips,22691804,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/igycgt/lpt_keep_a_list_of_gift_ideas_for_the_people_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/igycgt/lpt_keep_a_list_of_gift_ideas_for_the_people_in/,self.LifeProTips,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"For maybe the past 5 years now, whenever I get close enough to someone that I feel like I'm going to be regularly buying them gifts (for birthdays or holidays mostly) I make an empty list in my phone with their name on the top. Then I wait. As time goes on, people have a tendency to mention things they really like or want. Whenever that happens, I just quietly add to the list. 

Watching TV and your girlfriend casually ways she really likes the robe that some woman on screen is wearing? Added to the list. Walking through Hallmark with my mom and she says she really likes these small glass statues l? List.

Now it's [non-denominational winter holiday] and while everyone else is scrambling for a present, I can rest easy because I can just consult the list and get everyone something that they will both love and never see coming.

I've learned that the real power of the list comes after it has accumulated entries. Once this happens you can combine gift ideas in a way that the other person could never expect. While going through an art mueseum 8 months ago with my (now ex) girlfriend, she casually mentions that she really likes this painting. I look at the title and author, take a picture, and add it to the list. She also really likes jigsaw puzzles. Once I noticed that I added it to the list. For her last birthday I was looking through the list to see if I could think of anything and I decided to get her a custom jigsaw puzzle of this one painting that she loved and has since never seen again. She was stoked when she opened it and it's been her favorite puzzle since (even after the breakup).

I went from being a terrible gift giver to being incredible at it. People are genuinely excited to recoece a gift from me now. Seeing their face light up every time their birthday or a holiday comes around makes this a huge payoff for basically zero effort."

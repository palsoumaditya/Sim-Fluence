#[I’m Paula Jean Swearengin, and I’m running for US Senate in West Virginia.](http://imgur.com/U9Jtsbx)

---

Barely five months ago, I was standing at a town hall where Joe Manchin was supposed to be listening to his constituents in Charleston, West Virginia. I’ve been a social and economic activist for many years, and I heard that he was at this town hall, just minutes after I got off work. I left in such a hurry that I didn’t even have money for the toll -- I had to leave an IOU instead. I was desperate to speak to him because my community had suffered so much, and I held onto the hope that he would hear me. Instead of cooking dinner for my youngest son, yet again, I went on a mission to beg for my children’s future. I wanted them to have clean water, clean air, and a stable economic future. I was especially frustrated because the most-polluting coal baron in West Virginia, Jim Justice, became my Democratic Governor. His mountaintop removal coal-mining operation is just three miles from my house, and continues to put silica dust in the air and my childrens’ lungs daily.

---

###When I approach my Senator, I told him about the water pollution, air pollution, and the fact that I buried most of my family because of coal mining with diseases like black lung and cancer. I told him that we all deserved clean and safe jobs. 

---

“We would have to agree to disagree” he told me, as he tried to bid the coal miners in the crowd against me. When I told him about my family dying, he turned to them and said they needed jobs -- as if that was more important than their own safety, and their families and surrounding communities being poisoned and dying.

Not only did he act like he was immune to my struggle as a coal miner’s daughter, he tried to divide and turn our community against one another. We shouldn’t have to fight each other for basic human rights like clean water, clean air and have access to jobs to provide for our families.Little did Joe know that the coal miners in the crowd met and stood with me afterwards, and we talked about real solutions -- not just slogans.

A month earlier, Sen. Manchin taunted voters to kick him out of office if they didn’t like what he was up to. “What you ought to do is vote me out. Vote me out! I’m not changing. Find somebody else who can beat me and vote me out,” he said. So, after my encounter with the Senator, I decided to take him up on his challenge -- I was going to take his seat from him, and return representation to the people of West Virginia.

Like most of my generation I was born a coal miner’s daughter and granddaughter. I have lived most of my life watching the progression and regression of coal. I have witnessed
first-hand the impact it has on our health and communities. I have in lived poverty and in prosperity. I have tasted polluted water. I have enjoyed some of the cleanest water in the world -- that no longer exists. I have dealt with the suffering of burying family members far too soon and too young. I have lived in cancer-clustered communities. I live with the worry that my children will get cancer. I have watched my neighbors suffer on their way to the same fate. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with the frustration of what will happen to the people of Appalachia.

The promise of coal means more pollution, more cancer, and more black lung. The companies are still blowing up our mountains, burying our streams, destroying our heritage and devaluing our quality of life. We have no promise of a stable economic future with the market for coal being down. It has always been an unreliable and unstable economic resource. As many communities are forced to live in conditions comparable to a third-world country, people fear how they are going to provide for their families. No man or woman should have to choose between poisoning one child and feeding another.

It’s past time to end the fear that divides us. We need to start standing up for each other. There are alternatives. We can invest in a diverse economy. I, for one, don’t want my children to
inherit the struggles that we have had to endure. 

I’m proud to be a [Justice Democrat](http://www.justicedemocrats.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) and a [Brand New Congress](http://www.brandnewcongress.org?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801) candidate. That means I take $0 in corporate donations or PAC money. Zero. I rely on 100% individual small donors. I’ve watched how corporate money can twist even good politicians. I watched it happen to Sen. Manchin. I voted for him, long ago -- but I no longer recognize that man I voted for. It also means I support the [Brand New Congress platform](https://brandnewcongress.org/platform?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=PaulaJean&utm_campaign=AMA0801), including Medicare for All, free public higher and vocational education, and moving to an expanded economy for West Virginia and America, based on renewable energy.

As you may have imagined, the person typing and facilitating this AMA is not the 100 year old human, but his granddaughter, me!

A little bit about my grandpa: he grew up in Washington State, and has traveled quite a bit. He worked for the FDA for many years, some as an investigator, some as a pharmacist. He served in the air force during World War 2 as a photographer.

Clearly there's more to him than this, so ask him some questions!

Y'all he is enjoying this so much! He's flabbergasted at how many people are asking questions and upvoting him, at first he thought it was all people I knew haha. He's so happy! We're gonna take a little break, some of my family just arrived for a visit.

4:14 PM ET: we're back! gonna knock out some more questions until I have to dip. Appreciate all the interest! Sorry he sometimes misunderstands some questions aha.

With a lot of these I'll ask him and he says 'let me think about that a bit' and I'll circle back and I guess he hasn't finished thinking about them - so sorry for those still waiting! lol

5:05 PM ET: So he's starting to fall asleep as I ask him questions, so I think we're gonna call it a day aha. He's in rehab for a broken hip right now, and a bit forgetful and confused at times, so hopefully that will give some explanation to some of the stranger answers he's said. Thank you so much for everyone who asked things and commented and told stories and thanked him, he is just so pleased!!! I'll go through this as I'm able and answer what I can from my perspective. Next time I visit him, I'll try to get a few more answered. He'll remember this for a long time. Thank you all, SO MUCH!!!

11/6/19 5:39 PM ET: Hi all! I stopped by my grandpa's current place today and asked and answered a few more questions! He gets tired pretty quickly, and tends to say ""I need to think about that"" for things that aren't direct (broad questions like ""meaning of life"" and such), so for further questions I would encourage more specific questions. I'll continue asking him things as we're able - there are a lot to go through, but I and we appreciate the interest so much - every time I update him about the number of upvotes, his face lights up :)

We are currently headed down a very dangerous path, due to the fault of the super-wealthy who have gotten rich off of fossil fuels and extractive industries and covered up the negative consequences that will have a disproportionate harmful effect on poor people both in the future and now (BOOOO). While the situation is dire, THERE IS HOPE!!! But only if we come together and take an ACTIVE role in politics - local, state, and national - pushing for climate solutions! The easiest way to do this is, of course, to get good people into office who will push for climate justice so we don't have to be in the streets all the time, so vote responsibly - make sure that human isn't just greenwashing while still taking money from fossil fuel industry, but is taking REAL action (coughBERNIEandAOCareGREATcough)! And, if you are able, please please PLEASE join a climate justice organization, or donate to one - it has given me a great sense of community and solace being in the Sunrise Movement, being around people who are scared about the future just like me and learning about what to do about it together - it's been a truly transformative influence in my life, and I am so thankful for that. Links below for some organizations I like (but there are definitely others, so please, look them up and find one right for you!) (note: while my grandpa is not super hip about all the aspects of climate change, I have shared my life with him and he has been super supportive of me in my journey of action, and for that I am so grateful) JOIN, TAKE ACTION, SUPPORT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, AND/OR DONATE PLEASE, I WANT US ALL TO LIVE AS LONG AS MY GRANDPA <3

To quote from my memoir, ""I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family."" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.

Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.

When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.

In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.

My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.

My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\_1\_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&qid=1578004297&sr=8-4)

\*\*\* EDIT 1\*\*\*

Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.

Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\*

Robert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:

I’d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, “FEARLESS” “A Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.” I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler’s military. I was one of them."

This summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.

This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.

To push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** 

In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.

No matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.

UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department.

So, I've decided to expand my support of the charity Didi Hirsch with their work in the field of women's body issues, and have partnered with Represent.com to [release a limited edition ""don't be a D.N.B."" shirt](http://represent.com/ronda), with a portion of proceeds benefiting this amazing cause.

atkycd,I'm an ex-Scientologist who was trafficked for labor by Scientology from ages 15 - 18. I reported it to the FBI and they did nothing. AMA [Trigger Warning],68403,0.84,2896,2019-02-22 23:53:00,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/atkycd/im_an_exscientologist_who_was_trafficked_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/atkycd/im_an_exscientologist_who_was_trafficked_for/,self.IAmA,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"My name is [Derek Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/user/dbloch7986). 

I am not the typical ""high-ranking"" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). [Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.](https://truepic.com/gx54exce) 

FTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.

[First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists.](http://www.forum.exscn.net/threads/a-brief-summary-of-my-time-inside.26189/#post656666) It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.

After Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a >!""pussy""!< for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a >!""faggot""!<. >!{Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}!<

[Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.](https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/16/scientology-disconnection-and-homophobia-derek-blochs-story/)

>!(Ef yoo dad.)!<

[I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1328-5-disturbing-things-i-learned-in-scientologys-space-navy.html)

I tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. [Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/27/derek-bloch-on-fighting-scientology-disconnection-in-an-unaired-tv-series-2/)

Obviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.

*On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!* 

*I'll be popping in when I get some notifications, but otherwise I'm just assuming this will disappear into the* [abyss of the interweb tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs)*.*

Some people have always wanted to go into politics. _Not me._ I’d rather be hiking with my dog, to be perfectly frank. Or gardening… or making jam.

“Don’t MAKE me come down there!” That’s what it feels like—like we have to deal with misbehaving kids in the backseat of a car. “I WILL turn this state around!”

Someone has to, right?

#Evidently we can’t leave governance to those who want to do it as a career. Sometimes regular people have to step in and demand we work on issues that will help people rather than engage in party politics. We need more public servants, and fewer politicians.

What we need now is a plan that turns all this momentum into practical steps to achieve our big goals.

My book lays out exactly what that plan could look like.

When I wasn’t working on my book, I spent a lot time over the last year working with my colleagues at the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/our-story) and around the world on [ways to stop COVID-19](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-funding-additional-250-million-suzman).

Today a diverse coalition of interested parties including the ACLU, Amazon, Etsy, Mozilla, Kickstarter, and many others came together to sound the alarm about the Federal Communications Commission’s attack on net neutrality.
A free and open internet is vital for our democracy and for our daily lives. But the FCC is considering a proposal that threatens net neutrality — and therefore the internet as we know it.

“Network neutrality” is based on a simple premise: that the company that provides your Internet connection can't interfere with how you communicate over that connection. An Internet carrier’s job is to deliver data from its origin to its destination — not to block, slow down, or de-prioritize information because they don't like its content.

He was a character on The West Wing.  Played by Oliver Platt?  He was in like 8 episodes?  It doesn't matter.
 
My second cookbook, The Binging with Babish companion cookbook, hits shelves and slides into your DM's (domestic mail's) today - it's got the first hundred recipes from the show, good and bad, terrible and wonderful, for your consideration and recreation.  I started out posting pretty pictures of my various dinners to /r/food, and eventually had the idea to make what I called a ""moving-picture"" (I've since learned that this is called a video) of my food, and share it on this community.  This was the first episode of Binging with Babish, the show where I recreate foods from movies and television.  Three and a half years later, and I'm making all different kinds of shows, getting to be a guest on Hot Ones (shout out /u/seanseaevans), buying my brother his dream car, opening a brewpub in Brooklyn, and dropping my second cookbook.  I've said this many times before, but I owe my career and wonderful new life to the Reddit community, who helped spread the word about my show in /r/videos, /r/cooking, and /r/food.  My channel is one of the countless examples of how content creation and creativity are being slowly democratized, and how almost anyone, anywhere, with little more than a camera and an internet connection, can potentially have their voice heard by millions.  It's not something I ever imagined for myself, and as I say in my book: I will spend the rest of my life working to earn everything you've given me.

Anywho before I get all weepy, let's get to it!  AMA!!

EDIT: I should probably mention that I'm going on my nationwide book tour starting today!  [Git your tix here](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/events)!

For the last four years, I've reported on the Church of Scientology for the Tampa Bay Times.
 
For the last six months, I've been investigating a spate of real estate purchases in downtown Clearwater, Fla. The Church of Scientology and companies run by its members have spent $103 million since 2017 buying about 100 properties. They now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront. We built a [graphic demonstrating just how little is left](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/).
 
Downtown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination. Yet downtown is dotted with empty storefronts. The purchases took off as the city was developing a $64 million plan to turn the area around. We don’t know whether these purchases will help the city’s goal.
 
The church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control. I recap the [whole history here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/scientologys-40-years-of-conflict-with-the-city-of-clearwater-recapped/).
 
In April 2017, the city snubbed Scientology Leader David Miscavige. Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.
 
The church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as “mindless robots.” But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church’s involvement.
 
For more, [read the investigation here.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/) We also published a story on what [city council members think.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/what-clearwaters-city-council-thinks-about-scientologys-downtown-takeover/)

Update 2: That's a wrap! Thanks for your questions and for your help in the fight to rein in government spying powers.
------------

A mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it.  Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law. 
 
Under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.

The surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.
 
Some in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse. We need to make clear to our lawmakers that we’re expecting them to rein government’s worst and most harmful spying powers.

I saw that other post where a protester set up an AMA and thought that maybe I could chime in as well.

I've been at the protests during weekends and holidays since I'm also currently in secondary school. I've witnessed first hand the injuries sustained by the protesters due to their participation in the movement and have been in a few situations where I almost got arrested.

You can ask me stuff about the injuries I've treated, my background, my opinions about the protests, or what I had for breakfast, anything goes :)

EDIT: Sorry for the clumsy title, I used the word protest 4 times in the same sentence oops

EDIT 2: I'm gonna go ahead and eat dinner, Ill be back to answering questions in an hour or so (7:42 PM HK time), thanks for all the questions so far guys!

EDIT 3:

A lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term ""medic"" as anything more than ""person who gives medical assistance"" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.

I am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.

Is this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.

**香港人，反抗**

EDIT 4:

If you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it

* Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)
* Donate to legal aid organisations such as 星火聯盟 (FB Page:  [https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/](https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/)  message them and ask for ways to donate)
* Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)
* Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post

EDIT 5:

Due to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella, u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)

EDIT 6: I'll be heading off to take a break now, I'll continue answering later on if I can, I'll be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions! If you have any more questions well after this post is published, feel free to PM me and I'll reply"

Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.

NASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725
For more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/

This discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water – key to life as we know it – under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.

At about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.

We're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything!

They were ""lucky"" to be sold as brides, not brothel workers.

One ran away and was brought home safely; the other two just disappeared. Nobody knew where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive.

I gave up everything and risked my life to find the girls in China. To everyone's surprise (including my own!), I did actually find them - but that was just the beginning.

Both of my friends had given birth in China. Still just teenagers, they faced a heartbreaking dilemma: each girl had to choose between her daughter and her own freedom.

For six years I've been a full-time volunteer with 'The Human, Earth Project', to help fight the global human trafficking crisis. Of its 40 million victims, most are women sold for sex, and many are only girls.

We recently released an award-winning documentary to tell my friends' stories, and are now fundraising to continue our anti-trafficking work. You can now check out the film for $1 and help support our work at [http://www.sistersforsale.com](http://www.sistersforsale.com)

BIG LOVE to everyone who has contributed to help support our work. We really need funding to keep this organisation alive. Your support makes a huge difference, and really means a lot to us - THANK YOU!!

(Also - we have only one volunteer here responding to contributions. Please be patient with her - she's doing her best, and will send you the goodies as soon as she can!) :)

Wow the response here has just been overwhelming! I've been answering questions for six hours and it's definitely time for me to take a break.

In that year, I started working on nuclear energy at Argonne National Laboratories on safe and effective handling of spent nuclear fuel. In 2018 I retired from government work at the age of 92 but I continue to be involved in learning and educating about safe nuclear power.

After my time at Argonne, I obtained a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from MIT and was an assistant professor there for 4 years, worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 18 years where I served as the Deputy Director of Chemical Technology Division, then for the Atomic Energy Commission starting in 1972, where I served as the Director of General Energy Development. In 1984 I was working for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, trying to develop a long-term program for nuclear waste repositories, which was going well but was ultimately canceled due to political opposition.

Since that time I’ve been working primarily in the US Department of Energy on nuclear waste management broadly — recovery of unused energy, safe disposal, and trying as much as possible to be in touch with similar programs in other parts of the world (Russia, Canada, Japan, France, Finland, etc.) I try to visit and talk with people involved with those programs to learn and help steer the US’s efforts in the right direction.

We've spent just short of a year investigating ['zombie campaigns'](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/): political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.

We found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members – all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.

It's not just small fish either. We found [Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=paul,%20ron) over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. [He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/ron_paul.mp4) outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. [Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=bunning) since he retired. [Mark Foley](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=foley), who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. [George LeMieux](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=lemieux) hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent [$41k+ on management consulting services](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&data_type=processed&committee_id=C00494971&recipient_name=milano&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=12%2F31%2F2016) and then [denied to us on camera](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/g_lemieux.mp4) when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. [Mark Takai](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=takai). A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.

ix1ocn,I am actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. You may remember me as Jaime Lannister on GoT... I've just launched a platform for grassroots giving called Dandi. AMA!,51029,0.88,3455,2020-09-21 20:09:41,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ix1ocn/i_am_actor_nikolaj_costerwaldau_you_may_remember/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ix1ocn/i_am_actor_nikolaj_costerwaldau_you_may_remember/,self.IAmA,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"Hi. ﻿ I’m excited to share Dandi with you. [www.dandi.io](https://dandi.io/)

Confronted by the enormous challenges we face both locally and globally, it’s easy to feel powerless and overwhelmed. 

For the past 4 years, I have been lucky to work for the UNDP as a goodwill ambassador and have seen not only the real challenges we face but also been blessed to meet dedicated people from all over the world desperately wanting to make the world a better place. 

Unfortunately, charities have to spend way too much time fundraising, branding and networking– and less time doing the important work. I have had countless discussions trying to find a way to better this system. 

By using technology there is a way. We need to insist on working together across nonprofits to make sure we achieve the goals we all share, as quickly and efficiently as possible. That resources go to the groups that can solve whatever a specific challenge calls for, as soon as the need is there. Dandi is a tool that can enable us to do just that. 

Using and combining huge amounts of data from nonprofits on the ground, we will be able to direct funds to where they will have the most positive impact– faster and more efficiently than ever before.

 I urge you to check out Dandi and join this new movement of collaborative humanitarian action. 

Thank you, 

Nikolaj

***Annyeonghaseyo!*** 

My name is Joy and I’m from North Korea. I escaped to China when I was 18 but was immediately trafficked and sold as a bride to a Chinese man for $3,000 USD. Life was difficult, but I gave birth to a daughter who became the joy of my life. After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day. 

Because I have family in North Korea that could face punishment if my identity was revealed, I cannot share my real name or show my face.

I am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK’s new film [Sleep Well, My Baby](https://www.sleepwellmybaby.com/). It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I’m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.

[Liberty in North Korea](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/) is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes.

We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.

This is a followup to the [AMA I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/), just after the federal lawsuit was filed.

Hey guys, I founded [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com). Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city. 

Basically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. [New York to San Francisco example](http://i.imgur.com/Np06G1j.jpg). There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.

While Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as ""skiplagging"". United Airlines didn't like any of this. 

Around September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.

Fast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.

Skiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be [on national tv](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-cheap-airfare-made-easier-with-skiplagged-startup/). Then cnn reached out and [published an article](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/29/news/united-orbitz-sue-skiplagged-22/). Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions. 

Fast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.

From running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community. 

**Also, I need your help.** 

The crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000.

I will be participating in a Reddit AMA to answer any and all questions. I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don’t have an answer to a specific question or that I don’t know enough to answer it. 

I recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series **Formative**, in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY

The founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple’s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.

I’m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we’ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.

I admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don’t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.

Finally, I’m hosting the Silicon Valley Comic Con this weekend March 18 - 19th, so come check it out.  You can buy tickets [here](https://register.growtix.com/e/silicon_valley_comic_con).

Well, I've gotta get ready for my FB Live with Josh McDermott.  We'll be live at 3PM PST.  Please check us out and ask whatever questions you might have.  I'll also be with Andrew J. West at the Laemmle's on Wilshire in Beverly Hills at 7:30pm for the screening of Middle Man.  Go to their website for tix.  We'll be doing a Q&A after the film.

I want to thank you all for taking the time to either ask questions or check out the answers.  I love doing these kind of things.  I think they're much more revealing than your average interview.  REDDIT is one of the greatest places for information about ... anything.  Literally anything.  

I'm heading to Boston tomorrow to go to the 7:30pm screening of Middle Man at the Boston Common 19 on Tremont Street.  I'll also by in NYC on Tuesday at the Empire Theater on 42nd to meet people at the 7:30pm (I think...if not around that time) where we'll also be doing a Q&A with me and director Ned Crowley.

Please check me out on The Late Late Show with Seth Meyers next Wednesday, the 14th.  Seth is one of the really good guys.  I love being on his show.

Again, thank you for all the great questions and taking the time out to spend with me.  I'm forever astounded and grateful for the love I'm shown every day.

EDIT 1: Hey everyone.  I have to do a phone interview at 11 PST.  I'll be back after we hang up.  In the mean time check out the trailer for Middle Man.  I promise you a thrilling, dark, funny ride with this film:

http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

Hey Reddit! 
Thank you for having me back! I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called ""Middle Man""  which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol. 

In the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result – as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.

Here's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/

Here's me and my doggos for ""proof""  http://imgur.com/a/4Ti7B

I will be back in about two hours to answer your questions.

2:20 PM - We are working on the laptops doing an online activity when we hear about 10-15 gunshots outside of our door. Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(

[Here is an edited version of the map](http://prntscr.com/ifnd5k) to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red). Thank you for the support you have been giving. And if any of you came out to the vigil yesterday, I have no words for how happy I am that you came to support.

If you have any questions about what went on on Wednesday, let me know, I'm here to fulfill your interest.

In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide — a crime I didn’t commit. I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn’t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 23 years behind bars trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of 2019, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me. After I got out, I started ""I Am Resilience,"" an organization that raises awareness about those who have been wrongly convicted. Last month, I got married and, in December, we're expecting a baby daughter.
 
And I’m Sean O’Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. With the help of UMKC clinical students and my co-counsel, Cindy Dodge,  I represented Ricky for more than a decade and eventually got him released last year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row. Before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.
 
Ricky’s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America’s public defender systems was the subject of a PBS NewsHour podcast called [“Broken Justice,”](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice) released last year. In October, about a year after Ricky was released, producer Frank Carlson checked in with him [for a special episode](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice/an-update-from-ricky-kidd).

Edit: 

Ricky: I’m happy that we had this time! It is always fun to be with the PBS NewsHour team, along with the one individual who first believed in me, who ultimately never left my side until I came home. A fun and exciting year it has been and looking forward to the next chapter with I Am Resilience/new baby/marriage/purposed living. Feel free to listen to ""Broken Justice"" if you haven’t had a chance, and if you would like to support and participate in the next chapter forward for me, feel free to follow this link and share as much as possible: https://linktr.ee/IAR

Sean: In closing: Until we reform indigent defense systems, this story will play out over and over again. There are lots of ways to get involved, and lots of good people trying to change the system. Find out who is doing the work in your community, and support them. Sister Helen Prejean says if all you can do is bake a pie, bake a pie and bring it to a meeting! I'm happy to say Ricky's team was kept well-fed by people who care."

I spent the last several months looking [into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/) while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida’s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in [the story](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/).

In recent years, the hospital has been one of the [most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/#chartbuilder-export). It’s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility. 

Last year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon “BJ” Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers’ practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits. He has no experience in healthcare. Now he runs the 126-bed hospital.

We also found that the hospital is part of a large chain of behavioral health facilities called Acadia Healthcare, which has had problems across the country. Our reporting on North Tampa Behavioral and Acadia is continuing. If you know anything, email me at [nbedi@tampabay.com](mailto:nbedi@tampabay.com).

My name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of “Cerro Gordo” this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. 

The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  

The Los Angeles News once wrote:

“What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.”

In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.

It’s been a wild ride so far owning a ‘ghost town’ and we’re having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it.

cqrf7a,Paperless voting machines are just waiting to be hacked in 2020. We are a POLITICO cybersecurity reporter and a voting security expert – ask us anything.,45514,0.86,3420,2019-08-15 21:02:51,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cqrf7a/paperless_voting_machines_are_just_waiting_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cqrf7a/paperless_voting_machines_are_just_waiting_to_be/,self.IAmA,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"Intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russian hackers will return to plague the 2020 presidential election, but the decentralized and underfunded U.S. election system has proven difficult to secure. While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.

[Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/), which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.

To understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions — including state and county governments — that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: [More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/). For various reasons — from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience — [America’s voting machines won’t be completely secure any time soon](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/election-security-cybersecurity-1445539).

**Ask us anything**.  ([Proof](https://twitter.com/politico/status/1161300134933618688))

A bit more about us:

**Eric Geller** is the POLITICO cybersecurity reporter behind this project. His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states’ efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO’s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.

Before joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC’s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration’s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.–China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.

**J. Alex Halderman** is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan’s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California’s “top-to-bottom” electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia’s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He is the creator of Security Digital Democracy, a massive, open, online course that explores the security risks—and future potential—of electronic voting and Internet voting technologies.

About a decade ago I quit my civil engineering job and spent 5 months walking 3,100 miles across the United States, from Rockaway Beach, NYC, to Rockaway Beach, Oregon. After returning to the East Coast, I drifted around and worked odd jobs for a while before deciding to take on another walking project, this time focused on one place: walking every block of every street in the 5 boroughs of NYC, plus parks, cemeteries, beaches, bridges, and other outdoor public(ish) spaces.

I don't have a particular goal or focus when I'm walking. I just try to pay attention to whatever's around me. It's amazing how much there is to see everywhere, whether you're in the middle of North Dakota, Staten Island, or Times Square. It just takes a long time to open your eyes to it all. I'm still working on opening mine. I meet a lot of people, take a lot of photos, and do a lot of research afterward to figure out the stories behind the things I encountered. I document the small wonders (and non-wonders) that I see and learn about on my website, [imjustwalkin.com](https://imjustwalkin.com/).

We're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.

Before Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))

We knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.

After a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.

Unfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!

After that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it. After 3 years of hard, hard work, the game is finished, and we're pretty proud of it.

My name is Brent and in July 2018 I purchased the former mining town of Cerro Gordo with my biz partner Jon and some friends. Cerro Gordo was once California’s largest producer of silver and once had nearly 5,000 residents and 500 buildings. Today, there are 22 buildings left, and I’m working to restore the town for more to be able to enjoy it. It’s an important piece of history.

They pulled nearly $500,000,000 worth of minerals out of Cerro Gordo and in it’s heyday, the town averaged a murder per week. That’s led to many paranormal experiences, rumors about hidden treasures, and many more legends around the town.
I came up here in mid-March to act as caretaker. I imagined coming up for a few weeks. It’s been over 6 months now. During that time here was a few snowstorms, a devastating fire, earthquakes, a flood that washed out the road, and a lot more.
 
I did an AMA back in March or April and a lot of redditors suggested I start taking videos of the experience, so now I post on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ghosttownliving), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/) about the town. [This video is recap of the 6 months here](https://youtu.be/r9PPgAvXkEY).
 
The 6 months has definitely changed me fundamentally and I plan on staying here full time for the foreseeable future. 
 
Anyway, I’m here hanging in my cabin, and figured I’d do an AMA. So, AMA!

# Our Goal with Brave

Yesterday, we launched the 1.0 version of our privacy web browser, *Brave*. Brave is an open source browser that blocks all 3rd-party ads, trackers, fingerprinting, and cryptomining; upgrades your connections to secure HTTPS; and offers truly Private “Incognito” Windows with *Tor*—right out of the box. By blocking all ads and trackers at the native level, **Brave is up to 3-6x faster than other browsers on page loads**, uses up to **3x less data** than Chrome or Firefox, and helps you extend battery life up to 2.5x.

However, the Internet as we know it faces a dilemma. We realize that publishers and content creators often rely on advertising revenue in order to produce the content we love. The problem is that most online advertising relies on tracking and data collection in order to target users, *without their consent*. This enables malware distribution, ad fraud, and social/political troll warfare. To solve this dilemma, we came up with a solution called *Brave Rewards*, which is now available on all platforms, including iOS.

Brave Rewards is entirely opt-in, and the idea is simple: if you choose to see privacy-respecting ads that you can control and turn off at any time, **you earn 70% of the ad revenue**. Your earnings, denominated in “Basic Attention Tokens” (BAT), accrue in a built-in browser wallet which you can then use to tip and support your favorite creators, spread among all your sites and channels, redeem for products, or exchange for cash. For example, when you navigate to a website, watch a YouTube video, or read a Reddit comment you like, you can *tip* them with a simple click. What’s amazing is that over 316,000 websites, YouTubers, etc. have already signed up, including major sites like **Wikipedia**, **The Guardian**, **The Washington Post**, **Khan Academy** and even **NPR.org**. You can too.

In the future, websites will also be able to run their own privacy-respecting ads that you can opt into, which will give them 70% of the revenue, and you—their audience—a 15% share (we always pay the ad slot owner 70%, and we always pay you the user at least what we get). They’re privacy-respecting because Brave moves all the interest-matching onto your device and into the browser client side, so **your data never leaves your device in the first place. Period.** All confirmations use an anonymous and unlinkable blind-signature cryptographic protocol. This flipping-the-script approach to keep all detailed intelligence and identity where your data originates, in your browser, is the key to ending personal data collection and surveillance capitalism once and for all.

Brave is available on both desktop (Windows PC, MacOS, Linux) and on mobile (Android, iOS), and our pre-1.0 browser has already reached over 8.7 million monthly active users—something we’re very proud of. [We hope you try Brave](https://brave.com/) and join this growing movement for the future of the Web. Ask us anything!

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Thanks everybody! It was a pleasure answering your questions in detail. It’s very encouraging to see so many people interested in Brave’s mission and in taking online privacy seriously. User consciousness is rising quickly now; the future of the web depends on it. We hope you give [**Brave 1.0**](https://brave.com/) a try.

Rather than give up, I bought four books from Amazon and spent the next few months learning how. A few months later, some of the hockey sales staff teamed up with me to get our prototype off the ground and together we now operate a small software company.

The idea was to create a crowd-sourced light show by synchronizing smartphone flashlights you see at concerts to the beat of the music. You can check out a [video of one of our light shows here](https://cueaudio.com/events/) at the Villanova-Purdue men’s basketball game two months ago. Basically, it works by using high-pitched, inaudible sound waves in a similar way that Bluetooth uses electromagnetic waves. All the devices in this video are getting their instructions from the music and could be in airplane mode. This means that the software can even be used to relay data to or synchronize devices through your television or computer. Possible uses range from making movies interactive with your smartphone, to [turning your $10 speaker into an iBeacon](https://vimeo.com/200193202) (interactive video if you’re watching on a laptop).  

If you’re interested in using this in your own apps, or are curious and want to read more, check out a [detailed description of the app software here](https://cueaudio.com/technology/).

Overall, I’ve been very lucky with how everything has turned out so far and wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it might help others who are looking to make their ideas a reality.

over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the *Süddeutsche Zeitung* (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. 

Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures. The *Süddeutsche Zeitung* decided to analyze the data in cooperation with the *International Consortium of Investigative Journalists* (ICIJ). In the past 12 months, around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents. 

We are three of them, and very happy to finally be able to talk about the work we did in the last year!

ecupsk,"Less than 30% of CBD products are accurately labeled. IAMA neuroscientist using third party, independent lab testing to find high-quality CBD products. Let’s chat about what CBD is good for, what it’s not good for, and everything in between. AMA.",40205,0.9,2283,2019-12-19 21:00:45,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ecupsk/less_than_30_of_cbd_products_are_accurately/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ecupsk/less_than_30_of_cbd_products_are_accurately/,self.IAmA,0,22,,text,False,False,False,"What is CBD? Will CBD get me high? Is CBD addictive? How much CBD do I take? What is CBD good for? I answer these questions among others every day.

The CBD market has exploded. With the CBD boom, snake oil merchants armed with misinformation and lack of regulation have saturated the market of the popular cannabinoid. It can be confusing or even scary for people to find legitimate information and products. Not everyone knows that there are a lot of poor quality CBD products in the market. [A 2017 study published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569) suggests only about 30% of CBD products are labeled accurately. We have done our own 3rd party blind testing on close to 400 products and only about 20% have been labeled accurately, meaning they failed for being within 10%+/- of the labeled amount of cannabinoids, had ingredients they shouldn’t have, or didn’t have ingredients they claimed to have. 

Some people know a lot about CBD and other related compounds, but there are many people who still have basic questions. After presenting and getting some great questions during a CBD panel at the [AZ Plant Medicine Conference](https://plantmedicineconference.com/austin-flohrschutz/), we thought we could share in the holiday spirit of giving to disseminate quality information to the community. **I am Austin Flohrschutz AMA about CBD!**

**My education**: BS in Behavioral Neuroscience and MS in Neuroscience (recently decided to leave a PhD program in Neuroscience with an MS degree to become Director of Science for a science-led CBD company). As an undergraduate, I worked in a medicinal chemistry lab focused on extracting biologically active compounds from plants (Salvia divinorum), which were then purified and used to synthesize new potential drugs to treat pain without addictive properties. While in graduate school I worked in a neuropharmacology lab focused on pain, opioids, addiction, and cannabinoids. At my current organization we formed a board of some pre-eminent cannabinoid researchers who sit on our [Science Advisory Board](https://www.trupotency.com/about-us#science-advisory-board) that I collaborate with, including:

**Todd Vanderah**, PhD in Pharmacology - Head and Professor of Pharmacology, and is a Professor in the Departments of Neurology and Anesthesiology at The University of Arizona, College of Medicine. His research interests include mechanisms of cancer pain, neuronal integration in pain pathways, neurochemical release during conditions of neuropathy, neuronal plasticity, addiction, cannabinoid & opioid receptor pharmacology, as well as the discovery of novel targets for new medications.

**Adam Friedman**, MD, FAAD is Professor and Interim Chair of Dermatology and serves as Residency Program Director, Director of Translational Research, and Director of the Supportive Oncodermatology Program in the Department of Dermatology at The George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. Dr. Friedman is investigating novel nanotechnologies that allow for advanced delivery of a wide spectrum of medicinally relevant molecules, such as cannabinoids, with an emphasis on treating infectious diseases, accelerating wound healing, immune modulation, and correcting vascular dysfunction.

**Dr. Hope Jones** is Chief Scientific Officer of Emergent Cannabis Sciences -- an advising company driving scientific innovation within the cannabis industry -- and CEO and founder of Adivina Crop Science -- offering state of the art cannabis tissue culture and micropropagation services. Dr. Jones' previously worked as a Staff Scientist for NASA’s Life Sciences and Biosystems Engineering Program, where she was responsible for micropropagation production of crops, phytochemical research, and developing growing system technologies for deep space missions. 

Note: Our science advisory board is currently busy today with work and teaching, so they will help answer questions over the next 24 hours or so through this shared account.

The company I work for is called [TruPotency.com](https://www.trupotency.com/). I and the other science advisors joined this company because we’re philosophically aligned with their mission of blind 3rd party testing every product to ensure they’re properly labeled and safe for use. We also upload our lab results to every product page. Lastly, we display cannabinoid and terpene profiles on every product page in an easy way to digest. We sincerely hope you find this useful.

Edit: Seems that this will be indeed happening Wednesday! To all the haters who said they’d never do it, I cordially invite you to suck it. Thank you EA for actually listening to your community and doing this AMA. Thank you everyone who upvoted this thread and made our voices heard! It’s awesomely empowering to actually get a response from a corporate monolith like EA based on a post like this. This is what happens when we rally as a community!!

Look, while we all have fun shitting on EA (because, well, they’re pretty notoriously bad) I’d like to genuinely hear their side of the story and give them a chance to defend some of their (really confusing) choices. After becoming the account with the  most-downvoted comment of all Reddit history that I could find (almost -200k at the time of this post) I think it would be really interesting to try and hear their side. 

Edit: comment is now over -400k downvotes. 

So, u/EACommunityTeam 

1. How will your company change your PR strategy in the face of such harsh public backlash? Any decent PR team would know that the Reddit hate is just the tip of the iceberg. People have hated your company for years. 
2. Will your team actually change the way micro-transactions are handled in games? How do you think that would end up affecting the whole industry? Most players seem to think it would be a positive change. Do you disagree and can you give us a convincing reason why?
3. How do you respond to the allegations that banned user Mat is still the one behind your account? 
4. Has the company suffered a noticeable amount of cancelled preorders/lost sales in the wake of this event? Essentially, are micro-transactions actually backfiring and losing net revenue because people just won’t buy the games anymore? How much longer do you think this can go on before you have a revolt on your hands and a massive flop of an otherwise good game, simply because people are sick of micro transactions?
5. How do you justify micro transactions? You’ve already paid for the game. Why should you have to pay more for loot boxes and characters? What happened to just unlocking it by getting good? 
6. Probably the most beloved gaming company you’ll see online is CD Projeckt Red. What can you learn from their business model to improve your own? Will you consider how their PR strategy is working infinitely better than your own and consider how, in light of that, you could improve your own?
7. What is it like working for a company that so many people hate? Do you get crap from gamer cousins at Thanksgiving? How does the company as a whole seem to be reacting to this bad press?
8. What happened to single player gaming at EA? Is it just a matter of profit? Is profit really the only driving factor in making games, or does it just seem that way to an outside source? How do you plan on changing that perception if your company does care about the quality of their product beyond its ability to generate revenue?
9. What do you feel you have to contribute to the conversation? Is there anything you’d like to know from your playerbase that could help you make better games? Did your team even realize how deep the hate against EA went, or did it just seem like a passing internet fad? 

If your PR team deems this acceptable, u/EACommunityTeam , I would love to hear from you. I’m guessing a few other downvoters would too. 


Edit: a few other questions I’ve seen come up more than once, and to increase the amount of “neutral” questions as suggested by several people:

10. What about Skate 4 Boy?
11. What about the expansion of mobile sports gaming? "

A post of [mine] (https://twitter.com/alexand63802267) in [r/marvelstudios] (https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/actrm0/dying_before_april_my_endgame/) evolved into a greater conversation about death and dying, and became the focus of a campaign for me to see Avengers Endgame before I die using the Avengers4Alexander hashtag. It worked - Disney have since contacted me.

I have Fanconi Anemia (FA) which interferes with my body's DNA repair. I've survived mouth cancer so far, but now face liver cancer and the threat of bone marrow failure. I get most of my nutrition through a PEG feeding tube because my mouth doesn't work well.

My sister died from the same disease but she was never diagnosed with FA while alive. I devote a lot of my time now to try and raise awareness about my disease by doing interviews, and help direct people to donate to research for a cure.

My hope is that at the least, people like my sister will get diagnosed before they undertake dangerous treatment, and at most that a cure will be created.

My friends were ""lucky"" - they were forced into marriage, not prostitution. They were 16 years old. 

After just a few months, one of my friends took her ""husband's"" phone and ran away. She was brought home safely. My other 2 friends just disappeared. I didn't know where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive. 

I gave up everything to investigate my friends' disappearances, and risked my life to try and find them in China - the world's most populous country, with over 1.357 billion people (more than 4x the population of the US!). After 5 months of searching, to everyone's surprise, I actually did find them. 

It was more than I'd ever hoped for - but that was just the beginning. By the time I found them, each of my 2 friends had given birth in China, and had to make a decision no mother should ever have to make: the choice between her child and her own freedom. 

I'm now sharing my friends' story as a documentary to raise awareness of the global human trafficking crisis, and to help protect vulnerable girls in Vietnam.

PROOF: You can find proof (and more information) on the front page of my website at http://www.humanearth.net

We're running a crowdfunding project to finish the documentary here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sisters-for-sale-a-human-trafficking-documentary/

I was really bad at school and I dropped out of high school at age fifteen and generally was a pretty stupid and not interested in learning anything. While pursuing my secondary school diploma I met a remarkable teacher (thanks Frau Reddanz!) who inspired a passion for learning and understanding the world in me. (Mostly by screaming at me passionately). This changed how I looked at anything education related - school really made stuff horribly boring but with passion and a different teaching approach everything actually became super interesting.

So I went on to study history but that was boring too ( university, not the subject) and finally I switched to  communication design with a focus on infographics, wanting to make difficult ideas engaging and accessible. During that time Edu Youtube became big and I ended up doing a video as bachelors thesis.

This project became one of the largest sciency channels on YouTube over the course of the following eight years. (It is still pretty funny to me as I'm the most unlikely person too that should explain people anything about anything) Today we have more than 16 million subscribers and 1.5 billion views on our main channel on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/kurzgesagt) and a team of 45 individuals working full time behind the scenes of the channel. We are known for the insane amount of hours we put into every video, which currently is north of 1200+ hours per video. Also we only published 150 videos in 8 years.

For the last decade, I've been working on and off on a [book about the immune system](https://sites.prh.com/immune), and decided to finish it during the pandemic, as it (obviously) felt like the right time. In the book, I take you on a journey through the fortress of the human body and its defenses and discuss a few diseases and how amazing your defenses are. The book happens to be released today if you want to check it out!

We’re sitting here with our Opa for the next two or three hours to hopefully answer some questions from you about his time during and around the second world war. 


We asked him to do this AmaA because for us it is very important to archieve the important experiences from that time and to not forget what has happened. He is a very active man, still doing some hunting (in his backyard), shooting game and being active in the garden. After our grandmother died in 2005, he picked up cooking, doing a course for cooking with venison (his venison cevapcici and venison meat cut into strips are super delicious) and started to do some crafting. 

Our Opa was born in 1927 in a tiny village in Lower Saxony near the border to North-Rhine-Westphalia. He was a Luftwaffe auxiliary personnel in Osnabrück with 14/15 years for 9 months and helped during the air raids against Osnabrück at that time. 


Afterwards he had 3 months of Arbeitsdienst (Labour Service) near the city of Rheine. Following that at the end of December 1944 he was drafted in as a soldier. He applied to be a candidate reserve officer which meant that he was not send to the front line immediately. He came to the Ruhr area for training and was then transferred to Czechoslovakia for further training. His life as a soldier lasted for half a year after which he was caught and send to Romania and then to Rostov-on-Don for four and a half years as a prisoner of war. During that time he worked in a factory and he had to take part in political education in a city called Taganrog where they were educated on the benefits of communism and stalinism. They had to sign a paper that they would support communism when they would go back home.


He came back home in 1949 and went to an agricultural school. During his time on the farm where he was in training, he met our grandmother. They married in 1957 despite her mother not being happy about the marriage. He didn’t have enough farmland, in her opinion. They had six kids, including our mother, and nowadays 13 grandchildren.

2. Why did you decide not to release half-life 3?
3. What were the leaks that happened over the years (i.e. hl3.txt...)? Were they actually parts of some form of half-life 3?

I make a free Reddit app for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), and yesterday you might have saw I [posted a little fundraiser here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cfmlca/i_build_the_apollo_reddit_app_and_im_donating_100/) in the Apple subreddit basically stating all the proceeds for the day from Apollo (it's a free app but has some in-app purchases for some cool extra Pro/Ultra features) will go to the my local SPCA animal shelter in Nova Scotia. It's definitely the hardest time of the year for them right now, because cats give birth in tremendous numbers in these warm months (dubbed Kitten Season) which creates a massive influx of orphaned and abandoned kitties, and shelters are seriously strained and need all the help they can get.

I was hoping to do some good for the shelter, but legitimately in my wildest dreams I did not expect so many people to come out and give support, I'm truly unable to form cohesive thoughts right now. They are legitimately such great people at that shelter, just for one example we recently had a cat in the community who was found badly abused and they looked after her, helped her with her bad leg (it ended up requiring an amputation) and [now Phoebe got adopted into a loving home](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/phoebe-cape-breton-cat-shot-adoption-1.5201865). Like that's just one example.

I also got my two cats Ruby and Hugo from there. Here's Ruby spinning in circles in delight when I told her: https://i.imgur.com/QWyckgy.gifv and here's Hugo somewhat annoyed I woke him up to tell him but undoubtedly stoked inside: https://i.imgur.com/S5ztw0T.gifv

Here's a tally of the donations. It came mostly from proceeds for the day but also was helped immensely by people commenting ($0.10 per comment on the AMA as well as the r/Apple thread) and retweeting, as well as awesome PayPal and crypto donations. It's easiest to show the breakdown/proof with a pic: 

Pic: https://i.imgur.com/YLjn7da.png

I'm working with them to get the money over to them. I was legitimately not expecting to hit anywhere near this much, so I thought my credit cards would do but I don't have a limit high enough to pay this much in one go, so I sent over $16,000, which is all my cards could handle, and I promise I'll get the rest over as soon as I can figure that out (SPCA said it was totally okay, and Apple doesn't pay until the following month, so it's not as if I have the money right now). Proof of $16K (we're over half way there): https://i.imgur.com/Jyeg7QK.png

(And before anyone asks, as much as I wish it was, this is extraordinarily far far far far more than Apollo makes on a normal day obviously.)

Like this is absolutely nuts, I actually can't believe or wrap my head around that we raised this much money. We actually broke records. Like seriously, here's the most recent (2017) [document I could find on their donors](http://www.novascotiaspca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ANNUAL-REPORT-2017.pdf). Walmart donated $2,000 - $5,000 (which is amazing). Not that it's a competition (every donor is a hero), but we did 5-10x more than WALMART for reference! How are we that awesome. I talked to them this morning and they said they were crying.

You have made my week, month, year, everything with this generosity. If you got Apollo Pro or Ultra yesterday I genuinely hope you love it and I'll continue to work my tail off to create the best Reddit app possible for all of you. Thank you so much again.

I tried to answer as many questions as I humanly could (my wrists legitimately ache right now) but in the spirit of the subreddit if you have any further questions I'll happily answer them haha!

Hello. My name is Charles Webb. Three years ago, while working IT for a small software company and binge playing Samurai-Gunn with my closest friends in much of my off time, I started working with one of them (Daniel Crockenberg.) Inspired by the wonderfully crafted combat mechanics of Samurai Gunn, we set out to make a punchy, fast paced dungeon-crawler with the depth and complexity of a fighting game!

Over time the community around the game grew enthusiastic enough that we decided we had to take the chance. We quit our jobs and began working on it full time. (Note: This is certainly usually a very bad idea!)

We decided to call the game 'Ruin of the Reckless', mostly as a reference to our sorry financial situation and the foolishness of our decision to make it. Hehe, get it!?

About two years later, we planned and launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to complete the game 'for real.' It was successful, largely due to the strength of our playable 'Backers Only' Build, which became popular with streamers like Tietuesday.

Edit: We've gotten a lot of questions about this whole thing specifically so I want to put this in OP for more clarity...

**""Sorry, there is a slight lack of clarity in my post here.
We worked on the game for about 2 years part-time BEFORE the Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter we worked for about 7 months before the game was released. ALL of our living expenses were paid out of our own finances/savings, Kickstarter money was only spent on game assets, contractor fees, etc...
We certainly didn't live for that entire time without any income!""**

Since then it has been non-stop work up to today putting the game together for our backers and the community at large. Over the course of development we have been through Steam Greenlight, conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign, been featured on several popular streams and youtube channels (including Tietuesday, DreadedCone, and TotalBiscuits wildly popular Co-Optional Podcast), met with major publishers, built a humble following of almost 2000 indie die-hards on twitter, signed on to and maintained contracts with almost 20 artists and musicians, been featured on many indie-gaming and videogaming news sites including Co-Optimus and well, a LOT of other stuff! It has really been quite a ride to get to this point!

I am also very proud and excited to say that we were recently accepted by GOG.com and will be included in to their curated store. To me this is a great honor and a validation of all of the hard work we have put in so far!

On release day we were featured on the front page of gog.com as well as the front page of the itch.io store. It remains to be seen whether we can crack the top sellers list on Steam but i'm crossing my fingers! We spent the first day on and near the top of the popular new releases page on Steam so release has gone well so far! (proof: https://twitter.com/FauxOperative/status/857426940889767936)

We are already in the process of having a new one made that has much less screenshake.  Thank you all for warning us that this was such a big issue!)**)

It is my sincere intention to answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION asked, no matter what the context is. So if you really want to, feel free to lay in to me and try to make me feel bad! I'll do my best to answer you to the best of my ability! :p

Ask me anything!

P.S: We tried to do this AMA a few days ago and it went really well... but it was taken down due to an error with one of the modbots.  We cleared everything up with the mods and so now we're back! Hi again everybody!

Edit: Uhh... We're on the front page of reddit right now! I didn't really expect that. I hope I can still get to everyone's questions! I will do my best! 

**FyrFoot is my dev partner and he's going to step in and start answering questions too.**

Edit: Hi guys, I did my best but uh... there is simply no way I can answer every single question any more. My inbox is growing significantly faster than I can answer them but I will be digging through the bottom and answering as many as I can.

Edit: Someone pointed out that we didn't highlight our bands enough.  These bands are awesome, you should support them!

My name is Linus, im 28 and have been living with Alport Syndrom since I was born. I got it from my mother and 1 of my 2 brothers also have it.

This disease affects the kidneys and basically wears them down over time so eventually they stop doing their job, my brother needed his first kidney at 21 and had to replace that at 31 because his body rejected it. I just got my first one from my brother who didnt have the disease, we had a 99.9% match so its looking Good so far 

Other then the kidneys this disease also affect my hearing (only in men tho) so I also have about 30% hearing left and hearing aids 

Addin some pictures, some of they are a little nsfw but I made sure to leave my man parts out ;) 

Me after waking up. http://imgur.com/a/RQFfwt0 the thing in my chest is a CDK for Hemo-dialys, you are welcome to ask questions about that 2 since I had dialys for 6months and got a looooot of bad stories like swelling in my Brain, seizures, putting the cdk in twice etc etc

Smart was abducted on June 5, 2002, and her captors controlled her by threatening to kill her and her family if she tried to escape. Fortunately, the police safely returned Elizabeth back to her family on March 12, 2003 after being held prisoner for nine grueling months.

Marking the 15th anniversary of Smart’s harrowing childhood abduction, A E and Lifetime will premiere a cross-network event that allows Smart to tell her story in her own words. A E’s Biography special [“Elizabeth Smart: Autobiography”](http://www.aetv.com/shows/autobiography) premieres in two 90-minute installments on Sunday, November 12 and Monday, November 13 at 9PM ET/PT. The intimate special allows Smart to explain her story in her own words and provides previously untold details about her infamous abduction. Lifetime’s Original Movie [“I Am Elizabeth Smart”](http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/i-am-elizabeth-smart) starring Skeet Ulrich (Riverdale, Jericho), Deirdre Lovejoy (The Blacklist, The Wire)  and Alana Boden (Ride) premieres Saturday, November 18 at 8PM ET/PT. Elizabeth serves as a producer and on-screen narrator in order to explore how she survived and confront the truths and misconceptions about her captivity.

The Elizabeth Smart Foundation was created by the Smart family to provide a place of hope, action, education, safety and prevention for children and their families wherever they may be, who may find themselves in similar situations as the Smarts, or who want to help others to avoid, recover, and ultimately thrive after they’ve been traumatized, violated, or hurt in any way.

Elizabeth’s story is also a New York Times Best Seller “My Story” available via her site www.ElizabethSmart.com

A poll released by the ACLU this week shows that a majority of Americans from across the political spectrum are deeply concerned about government surveillance. Lawmakers need to respond.

The pressure is on Congress to do exactly that, because Section 215 of the Patriot Act is set to expire on June 1. Now is the time to tell our representatives that America wants its privacy back. 

Senator Mitch McConnell has introduced a two-month extension of Section 215 – and the Senate has days left to vote on it. Urge Congress to let Section 215 die by:

Thank you all so much for the questions. I wish we had time to get around to all of them. For the people asking ""what can we do,"" the TL;DR is to call your senators for the next two days and tell them to reject any extension or authorization of 215. No matter how the law is changed, it'll be the first significant restriction on the Intelligence Community since the 1970s -- but only if you help.

That's it for the bonus round. Thank you again for all of the questions, and seriously, if the idea that the government is keeping a running tab of the personal associations of everyone in the country based on your calling data, please call 1-920-END-4-215 and tell them ""no exceptions,"" you are against any extension -- for any length of time -- of the unlawful Section 215 call records program. They've have two years to debate it and two court decisions declaring it illegal. It's time for reform.

EDIT 2: Gene, the u/washingtonpost user here. We're seeing a lot of repeated questions that we already answered, so for your convenience we'll surface several of them up here: 

Q: [If a person has been sexually assaulted by a public figure, what is the best way to approach the media? What kind of information should they bring forward?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draprn1/)

Q: [When was the first allegation brought to your attention?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drap8q2/) 

>[October.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draphq5/) 

Q: What about Beverly Nelson and the yearbook?
 
>[We reached out to Gloria repeatedly to try to connect with Beverly but she did not respond. Family members also declined to talk to us. So we did not report that we had confirmed her story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/draqkej/)

Q: [How much, if any, financial compensation does the publication give to people to incentivize them to come forward?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drb4ztw/?context=3)
 
>This question came up after the AMA was done, but unequivocally the answer is none. It did not happen in this case nor does it happen with any of our stories. The [Society of Professional Journalists advises against what is called ""checkbook journalism,""](https://www.spj.org/ethics-papers-cbj.asp) and it is also strictly against Washington Post policy. 

Q: What about net neutrality?

>[We are hosting another AMA on r/technology this Monday, Dec. 18 at noon ET/9 a.m. PST.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7k0rr1/we_are_the_washington_post_reporters_who_broke/drax4ra/) It will be with reporter Brian Fung ([proof](https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/941780766387732481)), who has been covering the issue for years, longer than he can remember.

And now I've launched https://WT.Social - a completely independent organization from Wikipedia or Wikia. https://WT.social is an outgrowth and continuation of the WikiTribune pilot project.

It is my belief that existing social media isn't good enough, and it isn't good enough for reasons that are very hard for the existing major companies to solve because their very business model drives them in a direction that is at the heart of the problems.

Advertising-only social media means that the only way to make money is to keep you clicking - and that means products that are designed to be addictive, optimized for time on site (number of ads you see), and as we have seen in recent times, this means content that is divisive, low quality, click bait, and all the rest.  It also means that your data is tracked and shared directly and indirectly with people who aren't just using it to send you more relevant ads (basically an ok thing) but also to undermine some of the fundamental values of democracy.

I have a different vision - social media with no ads and no paywall, where you only pay if you want to.  This changes my incentives immediately: you'll only pay if, in the long run, you think the site adds value to your life, to the lives of people you care about, and society in general. So rather than having a need to keep you clicking above all else, I have an incentive to do something that is meaningful to you.

Does that sound like a great business idea?  It doesn't to me, but there  you go, that's how I've done my career so far - bad business models!  I think it can work anyway, and so I'm trying.

TL;DR Social media companies suck, let's make something better.

Thank you all so much for your questions! Enjoy the rest of your day.

EDIT: I originally scheduled this AMA until 3, so I'm gonna stick around and answer any last minute questions until about 3:30 then we'll call it a day.


I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.

We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

Our election is on August 4th.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

1.	A Green New Deal 
2.	College for All and Student Debt Elimination 
3.	Medicare for All 
4.	No corporate money in politics 

I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

Due to this Covid-19 crisis, I am fully supporting www.rentstrike2020.org. Our core demands are freezing rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this crisis. We have a petition that has been signed by 2 million people nationwide, and RentStrike2020 is a national organization that is currently organizing with tenants organizations, immigration organizations, and other grassroots orgs to create a mutual aid fund and give power to the working class. Go to www.rentstrike2020.org to sign the petition for your state.

My opponent is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is a centrist who has taken almost 2 million dollars from corporate PACs. She doesn't support the Green New Deal or making college free. Her family has held this seat for 85 years straight. It is the longest dynasty in American Political history.

3. Without sharing anything too personal or otherwise untoward, what was your most memorable 'private' moment with President Obama that had nothing to do with your respective offices?
4. What sort of advice might you be able to give to those dealing with loss or tragedy in their own families, and if you are comfortable doing so, shed some light on how you dealt with it despite such public attention.
5. Knowing what you know now and having a front row seat to the Office of the Presidency for 8 years...if given the chance to do it all again, would you still run for President yourself?

**My 5 Questions:**

1. Does this type of ""reporting"" threaten our Democracy?
2. Do you feel this type of journalism compromises your integrity as a journalist?
3. What, if any, do you see as options career wise to working for Sinclair?
4. Is deregulation a good thing for American media?
5. Do you use social media to report on the news?

Front Page Edit: Thanks r/iama for popping my front page cherry. This is an issue I first really became aware of when John Oliver ran a piece on it a while back. Sinclair is not the only media company that seeks to monopolize media markets, but they're by far the largest and most insidious. I honestly have no idea how to combat this in our current political environment, but I think (If you're in the US) contacting your representative and senator and just leaving a short message or personally written email saying that they need to get rid of Ajit Pai and restore regulation on media ownership is a good start. Voting for politicians who have taken a position against media deregulation is the next step - if those in office now won't represent our interests we replace them with those who will. 

I still hope that one of these anchors can contact the mods and set up an AMA.

1. Why was CBD Oil ruled a Schedule 1 drug? Please be specific in your response, including cited sources and conclusive research that led you to believe CBD oil is as dangerous and deadly as heroin or meth. 
2. With more and more states legalizing marijuana / hemp, and with more and more proof that it has multiple medical benefits and a super low risk of dependency, why do you still enforce it as a schedule 1 drug?
3. How do you see your agency enforcing federal marijuana laws once all 50 states have legalized both recreationally and medically, as the trend shows will happen soon? 
4. There is no evidence that anyone has died directly as a result of ""overdosing"" on marijuana - but yet alcohol kills thousands each year. Can you please explain this ruling using specific data and/or research as to why alcohol is ranked as less of a danger than marijuana? 
5. If hemp could in theory reduce our dependencies on foreign trade for various materials, including paper, medicine, and even fuel, why does your agency still rule it as a danger to society, when it has clearly been proven to be a benefit, both health-wise and economically? 

EDIT: WOW! Front page in just over an hour. Thanks for the support guys. Keep upvoting! 

EDIT 2: Many are throwing speculation that this is some sort of ""karma whore"" post - and that my questions are combative or loaded. I do have a genuine interest in speaking to someone with a brain in the DEA, because despite popular opinion, I'd like to think that someone would contribute answers to my questions. As for the ""combativeness"" - yes, I am quite frustrated with DEA policy on marijuana (I'm not a regular user at all, but I don't support their decision to keep it illegal - like virtually everyone else with a brainstem) but they are intended to get right to the root of the issue. Again, should someone come forward and do the AMA, you can ask whatever questions you like, these aren't the only questions they'll have to answer, just my top 5. "

Read the actual bill text [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754).
 
**Take Action:**
 
Visit the [Stop Cyber Spying coalition](http://www.stopcyberspying.com) website where you can fax your Senators and tell them to vote no on CISA.

Use a new tool developed by Fight for the Future to [fax your lawmakers](https://www.faxbigbrother.com) from the Internet. We want to make sure they get the message.

Help us spread the word. After you’ve taken action, tweet out why CISA must be stopped with the hashtag #StopCISA. Use the hashtag #FaxBigBrother if you want to automatically send a fax to your Senator opposing CISA. If you have a blog, join us by publishing a blog post this week about why you oppose CISA, and help us spread the word about the action tools at [https://stopcyberspying.com/](https://stopcyberspying.com). 

For detailed analysis you can check out this [blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/senate-intelligence-committee-advances-terrible-cybersecurity-bill-surveillance) and this [chart](https://www.stopcyberspying.com/filebase/1431382367_Detailed_Bill_Analysis.pdf).

Edit 1: to add links.

**Edit 2: Responding to the popular question: ""Why does CISA keep returning?""**

*Especially with ever worse data breaches and cybersecurity problems, members of Congress are feeling pressure to take some action to help in the area. They want to be able to say they did something for cybersecurity, but lobbyists and the intelligence community are pushing bad bills like CISA. Surveillance defenders like Sen. Richard Burr are also using every procedural tool available to them to help move these bills quickly (like holding meetings to discuss the bill in secret). They'll keep doing it until we win overwhelmingly and make the bill toxic for good, like we did with SOPA. That's why it's important that everyone takes action and ownership of this fight. We know it's easy to feel frustrated, but it's incredibly important for people to know how much their calls, emails...and faxes in this case, really matter. Congress wants to focus on things people are paying attention to. It's our job to make sure they know people are paying attention to CISA. We couldn't do it without all of you.*

Edit 3: The east coast organizations have signed off for the day, but will be checking in every now and then to answer questions. Nadia and I will continue through 6pm PT. Afterwards, all of us will be checking this post over the next few days trying to answer any remaining questions. Thanks for all the support!

md1526,"I’m Terry Collingsworth, the human rights lawyer who filed a landmark child slavery lawsuit against Nestle, Mars, and Hershey. I am the Executive Director of International Rights Advocates, and a crusader against human rights violations in global supply chains. Ask me anything!",33342,0.91,1281,2021-03-25 21:10:47,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/md1526/im_terry_collingsworth_the_human_rights_lawyer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/md1526/im_terry_collingsworth_the_human_rights_lawyer/,self.IAmA,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"Hi Reddit, 

Thank you for highlighting this important issue on [r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/limws9/mars_nestl%C3%A9_and_hershey_to_face_landmark_child/)! 

As founder and Executive Director of the International Rights Advocates, and before that, between 1989 and 2007, General Counsel and Executive Director of International Labor Rights Forum, I have been at the forefront of every major effort to hold corporations accountable for failing to comply with international law or their own professed standards in their codes of conduct in their treatment of workers or communities in their far flung supply chains. 

After doing this work for several years and trying various ways of cooperating with multinationals, including working on joint initiatives, developing codes of conduct, and creating pilot programs, I sadly concluded that most companies operating in lawless environments in the global economy will do just about anything they can get away with to save money and increase profits. So, rather than continue to assume multinationals operate in good faith and could be reasoned with, I shifted my focus entirely, and for the last 25 years, have specialized in international human rights litigation. 

The prospect of getting a legal judgement along with the elevated public profile of a major legal case (thank you, Reddit!) gives IRAdvocates a concrete tool to force bad actors in the global economy to improve their practices. 

Representative cases are: Coubaly et. al v. Nestle et. al, No. 1:21 CV 00386 (eight Malian former child slaves have sued Nestle, Cargill, Mars, Hershey, Barry Callebaut, Mondelez and Olam under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act [TVPRA] for forced child labor and trafficking in their cocoa supply chains in Cote D’Ivoire); John Doe 1 et al. v. Nestle, SA and Cargill, Case No. CV 05-5133-SVW (six Malian former child slaves sued Nestle and Cargill under the Alien Tort Statute for using child slaves in their cocoa supply chains in Cote D’Ivoire); and John Doe 1 et. al v. Apple et. al, No. CV 1:19-cv-03737(14 families sued Apple, Tesla, Dell, Microsoft, and Google under the TVPRA for knowingly joining a supply chain for cobalt in the DRC that relies upon child labor). 

If you’d like to learn more, visit us at: http://www.iradvocates.org/

Ask me anything about corporate accountability for human rights violations in the global economy:

-What are legal avenues for holding corporations accountable for human rights violations in the global economy?
-How do you get your cases? 
-What are the practical challenges of representing victims of human rights violations in cases against multinationals with unlimited resources?
-Have you suffered retaliation or threats of harm for taking on powerful corporate interests?
-What are effective campaign strategies for reaching consumers of products made in violation of international human rights norms? 
-Why don’t more consumers care about human rights issues in the supply chains of their favorite brands? 
-Are there possible long-term solutions to persistent human rights problems?

I have published many articles and have given numerous interviews in various media on these topics. I attended Duke University School of Law and have taught at numerous law schools in the United States and have lectured in various programs around the world. I have personally visited and met with the people impacted by the human rights violations in all of my cases.

In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide -- a crime I didn’t commit. I had a rock-solid alibi for the day of the murders. Multiple people saw me that day and vouched on my behalf. I also knew who did it, and told this to the police. But I couldn’t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn’t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 22 years in prison trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of this year, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me.

And I’m Sean O’Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a founding member of the Midwest Innocence Project (MIP). I was part of an MIP team that represented Ricky over the past 13 years and that eventually got him released this year. I’ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row, and before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.

You can view videos of the incident with annotations [here](https://youtu.be/q0EQxGgqFRw), and you can read about it at the Washington Post [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/american-lawyer-hongkong-prison/2021/09/11/6e30d66e-f9b2-11eb-911c-524bc8b68f17_story.html), [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/lawyer-hong-kong-jail/2021/06/22/92b37dce-d014-11eb-a224-bd59bd22197c_story.html), and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/06/hong-kong-american-lawyer-prison/). 

On December 7, 2019, I came across two men brutally beating a teenager in a crowded MTR station.  The incident did not happen at a protest: all of us were simply out shopping on a normal Saturday. When one of the men then turned to attack a second person, I grabbed his baton and detained him until the police arrived. Both men denied being police officers in both English and Chinese, and the entire incident was filmed on CCTV and on bystanders’ phones. Despite having immediate access to evidence that the two men had committed serious and dangerous crimes, the police arrested me and allowed the men to go free. They later denied in writing that the men were police officers, then months later changed their story to say one of them was, in fact, a member of the police force whose retirement had been “delayed.”

The alleged police officer initially accused the teenager of committing a sexual assault, but admitted under oath that this was a lie.  He then claimed instead that the teenager jumped over a turnstile without paying, which is not an arrestable offense in Hong Kong.  Whether even this was true, we will likely never know, as the police initially sought the turnstile CCTV footage, but after viewing it they carved the footage out of a subpoena, ensuring they would be permanently destroyed by the MTR.

During the lead-up to trial, the police offered the second attacker--their only non-police witness to testify at trial--a HK$4,000 ($514 USD) cash payment and an ""award.""  

I am out on bail pending appeal after serving nearly two months of my 4.5 month sentence, and will return to prison if I lose my appeal. By speaking out, I expect retaliation from the Police, who have long shown a concerning lack of commitment to rule of law, but I’m done being silent. 

I first moved to Hong Kong in 2013, and fell in love with this city and its people. I have been a firsthand witness to the umbrella movement in 2014 and the 2019 democracy movement. As a lawyer, I have watched with deep concern as a well-developed system of laws and due process have been systematically weakened and abused by the Police and Government.

I met many prisoners inside--both political and ""ordinary"" prisoners--and learned a great deal about their plight. I saw the incredible courage they continue to show in the face of difficult circumstances. The injustices political prisoners face have been widely reported, but I also met many good men who had made mistakes--often drug-related--who have been sentenced to 20+ years, then allowed very little contact with the outside world and almost no real opportunities for rehabilitation.  I hope to be able to tell their stories too.

I’m open to questions from all comers. Tankies, feel free to ask your un-nuanced aggressive questions, but expect an equally un-nuanced aggressive reply.  

I will be posting updates about my situation and the plight of Hong Kong at my (relatively new) [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/samuelbickett).
******
ETA: I have been working with an organization called Voice For Prisoners (voiceforprisoners.org) that provides letters, visits, and other support to foreign prisoners in Hong Kong, most of whom are in for long prison sentences for drug offenses.  I met many of these prisoners inside and they are good people who made mistakes, and they badly need support and encouragement in their efforts to rehabilitate.  If anyone is looking for something they can do, I encourage you to check them out.

ETA2: Thank you everyone, I hope this has been helpful in raising awareness about some of the situation here in Hong Kong and in the prison system.  I am eternally grateful for all the support I've received.  

If you are not a Hongkonger and looking for ways you can help, I encourage you to reach out to local organizations helping Hong Kong refugees settle in your country or state.  Meet Hong Kongers.  Hire them in your companies.  Help them get settled.  Just be a friend.  Settling in a new place is very hard, and it means everything right now."

I did [this AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/39b67t/im_a_retired_bank_robber_ama/) four years ago and [this AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6ggv23/i_robbed_some_banks_ama/) two years ago.  In keeping with the every-two-years pattern, I’m here for a third (and likely final) AMA.

I’m not promoting anything.  Yes, I did write a book, but it’s free to redditors, so don’t bother asking me where to buy it.  I won’t tell you.  Just [download the thing for free](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5j4fe0/serious_exconvicts_of_reddit_how_was_the_first/dbdimej/) if you’re interested.

As before, I'll answer questions until they've all been answered.

Ask me anything about:

- Bank robbery

- Prison life

- Life after prison

- Anything you think I dodged in the first two AMA's

- The Enneagram

- Any of my three years in the ninth grade

- Autism

- My [all-time favorite Fortnite video](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bpt117/i_know_its_only_week_2_but_this_is_already_the/)

- Foosball

- My [post/comment history](https://old.reddit.com/user/helloiamCLAY/)

- Tattoo removal

- Being rejected by Amazon after being recruited by Amazon

- Anything else not listed here

E1:  Stopping to eat some lunch.  I'll be back soon to finish answering the rest.  If the mods allow, I don't mind live-streaming some of this later if anyone gives a shit.)

E2:  Back for more.  No idea if there's any interest, but I'm sharing my screen on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/helloiamclay), if you're curious what looks like being asked a zillion questions.  Same username there as here.

E3:  Stopping for dinner.  I'll be back in a couple hours if there are any new questions being asked.

E4:  Back to finish.  Link above is still good if you want to live chat instead of waiting for a reply here.

E5:  I’m done.  Thanks again.  Y’all are cool.  The link to the free download will stay.  Help yourself.  :)

My name is [Katie Beers](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/nyregion/a-girl-held-for-16-days-in-a-dungeon-now-looking-back-as-a-woman.html), a New York Times best-selling author and survivor. I am a survivor of physical, emotional, verbal, mental and sexual abuse. **25 years ago today, I made national headlines on December 28th, 1992 when a close family friend abducted me when I was 9 years old**. He then held me captive for 17 horrendous days in an [underground bunker](https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431005.1378396088!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_768/image.jpg) built specifically for me. On [January 13, 1993](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/nyregion/girl-missing-for-16-days-is-found-in-secret-room.html?pagewanted=all), John Esposito, my abductor, finally broke down and told his lawyers that he had abducted me. The abduction changed my life forever in many ways, including creating an opportunity for a [better life](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/katie-beers-kidnapping-allowed-me-to-escape-abuse/). [After my abduction](http://abcnews.go.com/US/dungeons-katie-beers-girls-held/story?id=18222603), I was placed in a foster home, where I should have been for years, receiving love, support, stability, structure and psychological care.  

I authored [Buried Memories](http://www.buriedmemories.com) to share my never-before-told true story of survival and recovery which quickly became a New York Times best-seller. I, at the center of a national media storm, dropped out of sight 25 years ago and until 5 years ago when my book Buried Memories was released, had never spoken publicly about my story. I released my book Buried Memories in January 2013 and have had subsequent media appearances in People, Newsday, Dr. Phil, Jeff Probst Show, Anderson Cooper, Nancy Grace, The View, Crime Watch Daily, and others over the years, speaking about my story of survival and recovery.  

I grew up in a world where abuse was swept under the rug, and not reported. Abuse wasn’t reported because the community didn’t know it was happening, abuse wasn’t reported because the community turned a blind eye, ignored it, didn’t report it, or didn’t know WHERE to report it.

Now an inspirational speaker, I feel blessed to share my story of recovery to the world. I’ve spoken at numerous conferences, summits, and workshops around the country in hope that other children can grow up in a world where people are aware of abuse and neglect warning signs and to help others with their own recovery.

When police have enough evidence to make an arrest but can't for reasons outside of their control, they can use the ""exceptionally cleared"" category.

From 2014-2018, the Pinellas sheriff's office reported more than 750 rapes to the state and feds. It said it cleared 440 cases, but **only** **111 ended in arrest** — the rest were exceptionally cleared.

The agency said victims didn’t want to move forward. Experts say that isn’t unusual.

Looking at a random sample of those cases, I found some that were counted as cleared *before* authorities had investigated enough to make an arrest. Two experts reviewed a dozen files for the *Times*, and they found missed investigative opportunities and failures to meet best practices in handling sexual assault cases.

We’re going to be the first U.S. astronauts to launch from America since 2011. We’re excited to be launching a new era in American spaceflight with NASA’s partners, Boeing and SpaceX. Those companies are developing the Starliner spacecraft, which will launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, and the Crew Dragon capsule launching atop the Falcon 9 rocket, respectively. These American-made spacecraft will be the first to launch from American soil to the International Space Station since NASA retired its Space Shuttle Program in 2011.

84nc3d,"We are chemical weapons attack survivors. Now, we are trying to hold corporations accountable for their role in the attack. Ask us anything.",31326,0.81,1107,2018-03-15 21:02:27,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/84nc3d/we_are_chemical_weapons_attack_survivors_now_we/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/84nc3d/we_are_chemical_weapons_attack_survivors_now_we/,self.IAmA,0,2,,text,False,False,False,"On March 16, 1988, a yellow cloud of mustard and sarin gas swirled throughout the city of Halabja in the Kurdish Region of Iraq. As the deadly gas seeped its way through the doors and windows of homes, over 5,000 Kurds were killed and more than 10,000 were injured in the most brutal chemical weapons attack since World War II.

It is clear that Saddam Hussein ordered this genocide, but he did not do it alone. A lawsuit based on new evidence and testimony from experts hired by the German Export Authority alleges that some of Europe’s largest corporations entered into a conspiracy to build and try to hide the purpose of the chemical weapons facilities Saddam Hussein used to carry out this genocide.

Two people who survived the attack –a man who was 19 at the time, who still suffers from respiratory disability, and a young girl who was orphaned and blinded – are plaintiffs in this case, members of the Halabja Chemical Victims Society, and will be joining Reddit for an AMA about the lawsuit, 30th anniversary of the attack, and the need to hold corporations like those that built Saddam’s chemical weapons accountable.

**Answering the AMA today are two survivors. Because of language and disability, their answers may come a little more slowly than other AMAs:**


**Aras Abid Akram** was 19 years old during the attack. Prior to the attack, he worked as a retailer selling drinks imported from Baghdad. He lost ten members of his family in the attack, including his parents and eight siblings. He was transferred to Iran for treatment and stayed there for 6 months. Upon returning to Iraq, he had to stay in a complex prepared by the Saddam Regime for people who survived in the attack in Halabja. He still suffers from lung disabilities and eye disease.

**Mardin Mahmood Fatah** was 4 years old on the day of the attack. She was severely burned and lost her vision because of the poisonous gases.  She was hospitalized in Tehran, Iran for more than 3 months and lost her consciousness for a period of time.  She was taken in by a family in Iran and lived with them for 10 years. After the father of that family died, she was informed that she was not his daughter, and not part of the family.  She returned to Iraq to search for her true family and later found out that her true mother and brother were killed by the chemical weapons in the attack.  Her father, who had married another woman and had a new family, refused to bring her into his household.  As the education she received in Iran was fundamentally different than the studies taught in the Kurdish Region, she was required to start high school again.  She is currently pursuing her college education but is suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress.

dwaa36,"When I graduated college, I had interviews at Google, Dropbox, Goldman Sachs, and others because of my resume, despite a 2.2 GPA. Now we've build a software to make the same resume for free. AMA!",31319,0.7,2904,2019-11-14 20:00:49,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dwaa36/when_i_graduated_college_i_had_interviews_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dwaa36/when_i_graduated_college_i_had_interviews_at/,self.IAmA,0,13,,text,False,False,False,"Hey guys, I'll keep this short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful. I'd like to spend some time to answer any questions you may have about your resume. 

Google receives more than two million job applications each year. Based on the number of applicants compared to hires, landing a job at Google is more competitive than getting into Harvard. If you want to stand a chance at a company like Google, your resume must pass their hiring systems (Applicant Tracking System aka ATS).

That was the secret to my success. I am Jacob Jacquet, CEO at [Rezi](https://rezi.io), and I've spent the last 4 years building a free resume software to recreate that exact resume.

[Here's a preview of the resume.](https://www.rezi.io/blog/img/senior-year-last.png)

[Proof of interview offer at Google](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQFQzXmZtEmJJA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1579132800&v=beta&t=hokHQ63FTk7D1VBENeXao9zBbl4-YyWO36hunsCEApk)

[Proof of interview offer at Goldman Sachs](https://i.imgur.com/0jDHBAN.png)


**Actually, making a perfect resume to pass an ATS is easy when you have relevant accomplishments and experiences to the job description you're applying to.** Yet, it is difficult to explain these experiences and recognize your achievements. 

##Here was an actual bullet point from my resume:

""Organized and implemented Google Analytics data tracking campaigns to maximize the effectiveness of email remarking initiatives that were deployed using Salesforce's marketing cloud software.""

Most job seekers would end the bullet at ""Organized and implemented Google Analytics data tracking campaigns"". However, this leaves out hirable information which gives the hiring manager a complete picture - the key to writing winning resume content is simply adding detail.

If you're struggling to add detail to your resume content - try to answer these questions.

* What did you do?
* Why did you do it?
* How did you do it?

I'm Sophie Zhang. I was fired from Facebook in September 2020; on my last day, I stayed up in an all-nighter to write a 7.8k word farewell memo that was leaked to the press and [went viral on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/isvmus/a_fired_facebook_employee_wrote_a_scathing/). I [went public with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/12/facebook-fake-engagement-whistleblower-sophie-zhang) on April 12 of this year, because the problems I worked on won't be solved unless I force the issue like this.

In the process of my work at Facebook, I caught state-sponsored troll farms in [Honduras](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/13/facebook-honduras-juan-orlando-hernandez-fake-engagement) and [Azerbaijan ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/13/facebook-azerbaijan-ilham-aliyev) that I only convinced the company to act on after a year - and was unable to stop the perpetrators from immediately returning afterwards.

In India, I worked [on a much smaller case](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/15/facebook-india-bjp-fake-accounts) where I found multiple groups of inauthentic activity benefiting multiple major political parties and received clearance to take them down. I took down all but one network - as soon as I realized that it was directly tied to a sitting member of the Lok Sabha, I was suddenly ignored,

In the United States, I played a small role in a case which drew [some attention on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nxctn0/revealed_rightwing_firm_posed_as_leftist_group_on/), in which a right-wing advertising group close to Turning Point USA was running ads supporting the Green Party in the leadup to the U.S. 2018 midterms. While Facebook eventually decided that the activity was permitted since no policies had been violated, [I came forward with the Guardian last month](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/11/facebook-ads-turning-point-usa-rally-forge) because it appeared that the perpetrators may have misled the FEC - a potential federal crime.

I also wrote [an op-ed for Rest of the World](https://restofworld.org/2021/sophie-zhang-facebook-autolikers/) about less-sophisticated/attention-getting social media inauthenticity

To be clear, since there was confusion about this [in my last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/mqw86u/i_am_sophie_zhang_whistleblower_at_fb_i_worked_to/), my remit was what Facebook calls inauthentic activity - when fake accounts/pages/etc. are used to do things, regardless of what they do. That is, if I set up a fake account to write ""cats are adorable"", this is inauthentic regardless of the fact that cats are actually adorable. This is often confused with misinformation \[which I did not work on\] but actually has no relation.

Please ask me anything. I might not be able to answer every question, but if so, I'll do my best to explain why I can't.

Hey there, Reddit. We’re here to answer anything about Europa—the moon of Jupiter that probably has more liquid water than all the Earth’s oceans combined.

Europa also seems likely to have heat energy and nutrients. Combine those all together and you’re looking at a place that could be habitable for life at this very moment. It’s like having our own little  goldilocks-zone exoplanet in our cosmic backyard.

We are:

* Bill Nye, The Science Guy, and CEO of [The Planetary Society](http://planetary.org)
* Dr. Ellen Stofan, NASA’s Chief Scientist
* Dr. Robert Pappalardo, Europa Study Scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
* Casey Dreier, Director of Advocacy for The Planetary Society

Why are we doing this? Fundamentally we all love Europa and the mysteries associated with it. What, if anything, can be found in the great oceans of Europa? How could NASA look for life? What would it mean to discover life or even to discover that there is no life there? These are compelling questions, and we’re talking about them today in a special event in D.C. We had such a strong response, we decided to talk about it on Reddit, too.

Some good Europa resources:

* [National Geographic’s cover story on Europa, Life Beyond Earth](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/astrobiology/)

* [A cliffs notes version of why Europa is so intriguing, with lots of great animations, also from NatGeo](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/astrobiology/distant-oasis/)

* How big is Europa? Here is a [comparison of surface areas of bodies in the solar system from Randall Monroe at xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1389/large/)

* [Here’s once concept of how NASA could begin to explore Europa, called the Clipper.](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/europa-clipper/)

- Be the first to swim 250 feet under the ice on a single breath of air

- Be the only one crazy enough to dive into a freezing lake, wearing only Speedos

And this year, I can add a new Guinness World Record to the list. But this time it is not just about me breaking record. I have set out to break this world record at the start of 2020 to bring the focus on the importance of protecting the oceans from overfishing, plastics and other unnatural destruction. I also want to show that in these trying times, you should never give up chasing your dreams.

I'm  one of the Uyghur People of central Asia, and the Chinese Government has locked up many of my friends and relatives in concentration camps. I'm trying to help bring the worlds attention to this issue, and to shine light on the horrific human rights abuses happening in Xinjiang. I'm the founder of the Campaign for Uyghurs, and I'm a full time activist who travels the world giving talks and connecting with other groups that have suffered from Chinese repression. I've worked with Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo bay and I've raised a family. I'm currently banned from China because of my political work. Today I'm being helped out by Uyghur Rally, a group of activists focused on demonstrations and campaigns around these issues in the United States. Ask Me Anything!

Since 2015, the Chinese Government has locked up millions of ethnic Uyghurs (and other Muslim minorities) in concentration camps, solely for their ethnic and religious identity. The ethnic homeland of the Uyghurs has become a hyper-militarized police state, with police stations on every block and millions of cameras. Cutting-edge technology is used to maximize the efficiency of this system, with facial recognition and biometric monitoring systems permeating every aspect of life in Xinjiang. This project is being orchestrated by the most senior officials in the Chinese government, and is nothing less than a full blown attempt to effectively eliminate the Uyghur people and culture from the face of the earth. This nightmare represents a profound violation of human rights on an industrial scale not seen since the second world war. They have gone to enormous lengths to hide the extent of this, but recent attention from investigative journalists and activists the eyes of the world have been turned on this atrocity.

UPDATE: 12/12: WOW! Front page. Thanks so much Reddit! Well, from Uyghur Rally’s end, we’d like to say a few things:

First of all, we are DEFINITELY not the CIA… we are just a group of activists that care a lot about something. Neither is Rushan. Working for the US government in the past doesn’t make you a spy, and neither does working to end human rights abuses. Fighting big wrongs requires allegiances between activists, nonprofits, and governments… that’s how change happens! So, for those of you who say we are the US government, you can believe that… but it’s not true. 

What is true is that something horrific is happening. There’s multiple ways of understanding it, and some details are hard to confirm, but there is overwhelming evidence of atrocities happening in XinJiang. This nightmare is real, no matter what the CCP says, and we feel that everyone in the world has a moral responsibility to do something about it. 

A lot of people have spoken about feeling helpless – so what can you do? Here’s a few things:

1) Donate to Uyghur activist organizations – Campaign For Uyghurs and others (https://campaignforuyghurs.org/). Support other organizations representing oppressed religious and ethnic minority groups, such as the Rohingya in Bangladesh. Support Free Hong Kong.

2) Follow us on social media - @UyghurRally, @Rushan614. Read and share media articles highlighting what’s going on in XinJiang. Western media has done a good job of covering this, but all over the world it is being highlighted.

3) Join our stickering campaign! “Google Uyghur”. You can print out stickers on our website (https://uyghurrally.org/) and distribute them!

4) Boycott Chinese goods manufactured in XinJiang, and avoid companies that do business there or support the technology of repression. Cotton from Xinjiang is a big one, as are Chinese facial recognition/AI companies.

5) Contact your government and ask them to do something about it! In the US, this is your senators and your congressmen. There are bills passed and being drafted can do something about this. Other countries around the world are also considering doing something about this, so look into local activist groups and movements within your government to stand up to Chinese oppression.

6) Stay active and watch out for propaganda – question everything! It’s nice to see such a robust discussion occur in the comments section here on Reddit. That couldn’t happen in China. 

Also, a last note. The Chinese government is not the Chinese people – sinophobia is a real problem in the world. This is one nightmare, and shouldn’t encourage further global divisions. The only way forward to find a way to be on the same page, and to support people everywhere all over the world. Freedom is a fundamental human right.

I’m a law professor and longtime political activist who decided to run against Congresswoman Schultz due to her strong support of the TPP and her unwillingness to listen to her constituents about our concerns. The TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) would have disastrous effects on our middle class while heavily benefitting the super-wealthy. There are many other ways that Congresswoman Schultz has failed her constituents, including her support of payday loan companies and her stance against medical marijuana. I am also a strong Bernie Sanders supporter, and not only have I endorsed him, I’m thrilled that he has endorsed me as well!

Our campaign has come a long way since I announced in January— we have raised over 2 million dollars, and like Bernie Sanders, it’s from small donors, not big corporations. Our average donation is just $17. Please help us raise more to defeat my opponent [here](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/rtimcanova).

The primary is August m30th, but early voting starts in just a few short weeks— so wem need as many volunteers around the country calling and doing voter ID. This let’s us use our local resources to canvass people face-to-face. Please help us out by going [here] (http://www.timcanova.com/phonebank).

Little backstory, my name's Christian Selig, I'm freshly 26 (today's my birthday actually!), and I build the [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) app.

In the summer of 2014 during my Computer Science degree I was lucky enough to intern at Apple as engineer on the Enterprise App Development team in Cupertino (long way from Eastern Canada), where I learned an absolute ton from some crazy smart people.

After returning I set out to build a Reddit app that felt like if Apple themselves was to design a Reddit app, something that really felt at home on iOS and used a lot of the skills I learned to create something super fast and lean, while also being powerful and just a lot of fun to use. After 2 years of development and betas working closely with a few thousand Redditors to help shape it into the perfect client, I released it in October 2017.

The reception was really amazing, and it's now almost at 1.5 million downloads. It's been my full-time job for about 4 years now.

**Today, 100% of the proceeds from the app will go to the SPCA Animal Shelter in Nova Scotia.** Apollo is free to download and has a Pro/Ultra version you can unlock, so if you get those today the proceeds will completely go to the animal shelter and helping the cats and dogs and bunnies and turtles.

**In addition I'll donate an extra $0.10 for every comment this thread gets by tomorrow. no spam tho plz**

Why right now? These warm months are dubbed [""kitten season""](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/) because it's far and away the time when most cats have kittens. Shelters are overwhelmed with abandoned/orphaned kittens and their resources and food becomes very very tight. The shelter we're donating to is where [I adopted my two amazing cats from](https://imgur.com/a/Rr9Cbtv), and they're truly an amazing bunch who cares so much, so I really want to help them in this time that's really stressful for them. 

Last year we did the same thing [and raised $5,000 for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/95ezsl/so_apollo_made_508723_yesterday_yeah_no_joke_just/) and they were absolutely floored. I really want to try to do $10,000 this year!

AMA! I will attempt to answer every question.

**EDIT**: A bunch have asked what the app exactly is in more detail haha, so here's the gist:

Apollo's an app for browsing Reddit on your iOS device, similar to the official Reddit app. I worked at Apple for a little while and was using Alien Blue, and really wanted to build a Reddit app that felt like if Apple themselves decided to build a Reddit app, something that felt perfectly at home on iOS. No knock on the official app (it's well done by talented people), but it doesn't follow a lot of the iOS design guidelines and feels a little Android-y to me at times. It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/).

Oh and I'm still answering questions.

**EDIT2**: It's getting late so I think I'm going to head to bed but I'll answer more in the morning!"

I’ve spent the last year and a half piecing together billionaire Peter Thiel’s decade long quest to destroy the media outlet Gawker. It was one of the most insane--and successful--secret plots in recent memory. I’ve been interested in the case since it began, but it wasn’t until I got a chance to interview both Peter Thiel, Gawker’s founder Nick Denton, Hulk Hogan, Charles Harder (the lawyer) et al that I felt I could tell the full story. The result is my newest book **[Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)**

When I started researching the 25,000 pages of legal documents and conducting interviews with all the key players, I learned a lot of the most interesting details of this conspiracy were left out of all previous coverage. Like the fact the secret weapon of the case was a 26 year old man known “Mr. A.” Or the various legal tactics employed by Peter’s team. Or Thiel ‘fanning the flames’ of #Gamergate. Sorry I'm getting carried away...

I wrote this story because beyond touching on many of our most urgent issues (privacy, media, the power of money), it is a timely reminder that things are rarely as they seem on the surface. Peter would tell me in one of our interviews people look down on conspiracies because we're so cynical we no longer believe in strong claims of human agency or the individual's ability to create change (for good or bad). It's a depressing thought. At the very least, this story is a reminder that that cynicism is premature...or at least naive. 

*[Conspiracy](https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Ryan-Holiday/dp/0735217645/)*  is my eighth book. My past books include *The Obstacle Is The Way, Ego Is The Enemy, The Daily Stoic, Trust Me, I’m Lying*, and *Growth Hacker Marketing*. Outside writing I run a marketing agency, [Brass Check](http://www.brasscheck.net/), and tend to (way too many) animals on my ranch outside Austin.

I’m excited to be here today and answer whatever reddit has on its mind!

We need to get back to work now, but thank you for joining us. 

You can follow for any updates on Julian Assange's case at his [legal defence website](https://justice4assange.com/) and support his defence [here](https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/45DZ1). You can suport WikiLeaks, which is tax deductible in Europe and the United States, [here](https://shop.wikileaks.org/donate).

And keep reading and researching the documents!

We are the [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) staff, including [Sarah Harrison](http://www.vogue.com/11122973/sarah-harrison-edward-snowden-wikileaks-nsa/). Over the last months we have published over 25,000 [emails from the DNC](https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/), over 30,000 [emails from Hillary Clinton](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), over 50,000 [emails from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/) and many chapters of the secret controversial [Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA)](https://wikileaks.org/tisa/).

The Clinton campaign unsuccessfully tried to claim that our publications are inaccurate. WikiLeaks’ decade-long pristine record for authentication remains. [As Julian said](https://wikileaks.org/Assange-Statement-on-the-US-Election.html): ""Our key publications this round have even been proven through the [cryptographic signatures](https://www.wikileaks.org/DKIM-Verification.html) of the companies they passed through, such as Google. It is not every day you can mathematically prove that your publications are perfect but this day is one of them.""

We have been very excited to see all the great citizen journalism taking place [here at Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/) on these publications, especially on the [DNC email archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/DNCleaks/) and the [Podesta emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5a3x7l/wikileaks_central_station_on_rthe_donald/?st=ivcib4ow&sh=895ef2e0).

Recently, the White House, in an effort to silence its most critical publisher during an election period, pressured for our editor Julian Assange's publications to be stopped. The government of Ecuador then issued a statement saying that it had ""temporarily"" [severed Mr. Assange's internet link over the US election](http://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/en/official-communique_2/). As of the 10th his internet connection has not been restored. There has been no explanation, which is concerning.

WikiLeaks has the necessary contingency plans in place to keep publishing. WikiLeaks staff, continue to monitor the situation closely.

---

(I’ll be answering questions at 2:00 PM EST today.)

My name is Jen Perelman, and I'm a candidate for Florida’s 23rd Congressional District, which covers Broward County and a portion of Miami-Dade County. We've been represented by Debbie Wasserman-Schultz for the last 15 years.

I believe that congressional representation is a term of public service, not a career. “Politician” should not be an occupation. As such, our campaign centers the needs of the vulnerable first and foremost. In place of traditional canvassing (which has been eliminated due to COVID-19), our campaign does community-service throughout the district in collaboration with local nonprofits. I hope to bring this spirit of social outreach with me to Washington. 

While there, I will fight for:

1. Ending the criminalization of drug addiction, poverty, and homelessness.
2. A new social contract that makes housing, healthcare, education, and a clean environment basic human rights.
3. Demilitarizing municipal law enforcement agencies.
4. The Medicare for All Act.

If you’d like to know more, check out [my Issues Page](https://jen2020.com/issues/), or just ask me here!

In the last AMA I did, a lot of people were concerned about election fraud. I’d like to make a statement on this from the offset: we have a new Supervisor of Elections who is not friends with Debbie and a new Citizens Election Audit. While I can’t make any guarantees about the election process, we have a lot more awareness than we did in 2016.

I'm doing this AMA on behalf of a documentary I'm co-producing called Check It. The film follows a gay street gang of 14-22 year olds struggling to survive in the city with the highest LGBT hate crime rate in the nation. The directors Dana Flor and Toby Oppenheimer have been filming this amazing group of kids for the past three years and focus on a point in their lives when they've seen a ray of hope, in the fashion world. 

Right now there is a Indiegogo campaign going on to raise funds for the directors to finish editing the film and 10% of what they raise will go to helping the Check It start a clothing line. Also, we've offered up some perks, so please check the campaign out.

As protests grow across the country, and police respond with escalating violence, we want to give a voice to those who don't have a platform. Over the coming days and weeks, we want to amplify Black voices who need and deserve to be heard. If you are one of these many, many, many voices, we invite you to do an Ask Me Anything on our subreddit to share it, answer questions from the community, and provide insight to those wanting to listen and learn.

We want to make something very clear: this is not temporary support. We will continue to support the Black Lives Matter movement with AMAs from prominent Black leaders until Reddit folds and we cannot host AMAs on the site anymore. The brutality and systemic racism that Black people face in the United States are the result of a fundamentally broken system — one that supports white people at the expense of those who are not; one that permits those in power to murder Black people and go unpunished; one that does not value the lives of Black people the same way it does the lives of white people.The opposite of racism is not complacency or saying that ""I don't see color;"" it is anti-racism.

The IAmA Team stands in solidarity with the Black community — against police violence, against systemic oppression, and against racism. To that end, we want to share a number of resources  to help those who read our AMAs learn how to be better allies and to be anti-racist. You can find those resources here:

Every entry goes to benefit the Runa Foundation, which works to preserve and support Amazonian farming communities. I've had an amazing experience working with them and learning about the incredible work they're doing to help local people and conserve the rainforest.

Look, I could sit here and tell you how great the cause is, and if that's interesting at all there's information about it and you can go find that. But to be honest, I can promise you that these premieres can be super-lame, but the Magic Mike premiere will be the most fun you will have at one of these things. It's pretty much all of the cast how we hung out on the movie, and we're all really good friends, and there will be a ginormous stripshow after the premiere. If you're into that.

I'm Sophie Zhang. I was fired from Facebook in September 2020, sending a 7.8k farewell memo on my last day that was [leaked to Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-ignore-political-manipulation-whistleblower-memo) and [went viral on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/isvmus/a_fired_facebook_employee_wrote_a_scathing/) w/ 52k upvotes.

Edit: FYI - I have a call with a reporter at noon PST \[an hour after this post was created\]; any responses will be more intermittent after that point.

Edit 2: I'm leaving for my call now. Thanks so much for the questions; I'll try to come back and respond to any further ones later, but I'm quite busy so can't promise unfortunately. Good luck everyone!

Edit 3: Answered some more questions from 1-1:30 PST. I'll try to be back later in a few hours, but my afternoon is very booked.

Edit 4 - 4:05 PST. Wow this, really blew up while I was gone! All my calls for the day are done now, so I can just stay here and answer questions until it gets late. Sorry for the wait!  


Last edit - 8:15 PST. I've spent the last 4 hrs answering questions, so calling it a night. Thank you so much for the questions, and I hope you found my answers to be reasonably fair, informative, and helpful. Since there was so much interest and I couldn't get around to everyone, I may do a further AMA on reddit again at some later point. I've also learned more about AMA protocol by now, so will definitely book much more time for question-answering in the future.

- If you’re intelligence, DoD, or have interesting propositions beyond some vague “you should do x” (those are welcome if they’re unique) you can email me here: pax-ama@opayq.com

- Here’s some semi-technical details of the attack: https://x.com/_hyp3ri0n/status/1803195682662051854

- No civilians were harmed in the attack. Only the elite aka regime have internet access, this was quite targeted. Civilians are unlikely to even know this happened. In fact they probably don’t.

Next person to tell me i’m an amoral imperialist is going straight to DCSA (DoD investigations)

##How I hack!?

First buckle in because it’s a years not weeks or months endeavor to be good. If you’re willing to put in the work anybody can get good. It’s like Ratatouille (or Racacoonie depending on your universe), anyone can hack!

First read a fuckton of introductory online resources. Go to securitytube and watch anything by Vivek. Man knows his shit.

Find introductory courses or buy intro books, some recommendations:

- Linux Basics for Hackers

- Metasploit: something somethjng (forget the full title)

- This next one is challenging and dated but an absolute must read: Hacking the Art of exploitation

- I hear Georgia Weismann’s PenTesting book is good and she’s a nice lady. So is her mom. That’s not a mom joke. I actually met her and she’s very sweet.

- Download and learn how to use virtualbox it’s probably the easiest way to start. It’s a virtualization software that you run essentially an operating system within an operating system. It’s open North Korea’s malware on my machine and that’s why it could not spread absolutely anywhere.. it’s useful for learning other operating systems so install Linux on there. I generally recommend Linux mint or Ubuntu. Parallels for MacOS users. If you want to real challenge, install something like freeBSD and learn how to use that.

- The web application hackers handbook is the Bible Web application hacking I always tell people if you read it from cover to cover and do all of the exercises. You’ll absolutely be a really good web app hacker

- Black hat python by Justin is recommended. Justin is a really good dude and does some really amazing projects. I know he knows his shit. In terms of the actual content, the goal is to learn python so don’t worry if you don’t fully understand all of the attacks going on. Although he explains them really well.

- for mobile, hacking I don’t know fuck all about it. So ask somebody smarter than me. Georgia I mentioned earlier I did some work in there so I don’t know fucking ask her.

- If you’re interested in macOS hacking there’s just a little bit of a dated book called the macOS hackers handbook I honestly haven’t read it so I can’t speak to the quality, but is the absolute Jesus of macho ass hacking.

- for more macOS stuff there are some books that are called. I think exploiting the macOS Colonel or maybe it’s just called the macOS Colonel highly suggest those but none of these ones are for the faint of heart.

- Use a lot of resources for courses. Security tube is an amazing resource watch anything by a dude named Vivek know who I’m talking about. He has a bunch of shit on there. If you’re starting out, look for beginners shit, go onto Udemy.

- if you want to pay out the ass, but also get a certification that people actually respect there is OSCP by offensive security, but in my opinion, the shit is a little bit overrated

- For programs, you can literally just download and learn right now and nmap is one of the most important ones for beginners. I think metasploit is really important and there’s a shit ton of material out there on it. Learn how passwords are stored and cracking passwords. Even just knowing what that means is important. So look up hashing and no, it doesn’t have anything to do with smoking hash, though that is an optional step

I did see interest in MacOS so here:

I'm a pianist and composer who was working as a financial analyst for the past 8 years in NYC. Couldn't handle it anymore and called it quits last month. I wasn't getting any chances to play at concert halls so I thought heck why not just rent them out myself and put on my own show? Renting the halls ISN'T cheap but at least I have enough savings for 1-2 concerts.

So last December I rented out Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall (!) and performed my [debut concert.](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2018/12/27/Lionel-Yu--Piano-0800PM) (turns out, it's surprisingly easy to rent out Carnegie Hall - I had 0 connections and 0 classical music performance experience and they still let me in 😂)

Today, I'm performing at Merkin Hall in NYC, a 440-seat theatre. The concert begins at 7:30PM EST and it will be 90 minutes of my original music + remixes of some classical pieces. My [concert info here](https://www.kaufmanmusiccenter.org/mch/event/musicalbasics-space-to-create/)

In-person tickets cost 35$ but I'm streaming the entire concert for free on [my Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/c/musicalbasics/live)

8d227x,"I am receiving Universal Basic Income payments as part of a pilot project being tested in Ontario, Canada.

I made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/8cx3w4/basic_income_for_canada_would_cost_43_billion_a/dxipfyr/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=canada) on r/canada on an [article](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/04/17/basic-income-cost-canada-pbo_a_23413268/) about Universal Basic Income, and how I'm receiving it as part of a pilot program in Ontario. There were numerous AMA requests, so here I am, happy to oblige.

In this pilot project, a few select cities in Ontario were chosen, where people who met the criteria (namely, if you're single and live under $34,000/year or if you're a couple living under $48,000) you were eligible to receive a basic income that supplements your current income, up to $1400/month. It was a random lottery. I went to an information session and applied, and they randomly selected two control groups - one group to receive basic income payments, and another that wouldn't, but both groups would still be required to fill out surveys regarding their quality of life with or without UBI. I was selected to be in the control group that receives monthly payments. 

AMA!

[Proof here](https://imgur.com/a/rfmOh) 


EDIT: Holy shit, I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone. Clearly this is a very important, and heated discussion, but one that's extremely relevant, and one I'm glad we're having. I'm happy to represent and advocate for UBI - I see how it's changed my life, and people should know about this. To the people calling me lazy, or a parasite, or wanting me to die... I hope you find happiness somewhere. For now though friends, it's past midnight in the magical land of Ontario, and I need to finish a project before going to bed. I will come back and answer more questions in the morning. Stay safe, friends!

EDIT 2: I am back, and here to answer more questions for a bit, but my day is full, and I didn't expect my inbox to die... first off, thanks for the gold!!! <3 Second, a lot of questions I'm getting are along the lines of, ""How do you morally justify being a lazy parasitic leech that's stealing money from taxpayers?"" - honestly, I don't see it that way at all. A lot of my earlier answers have been that I'm using the money to buy time to work and build my own career, why is this a bad thing? Are people who are sick and accessing Canada's free healthcare leeches and parasites stealing honest taxpayer money? Are people who send their children to publicly funded schools lazy entitled leeches? Also, as a clarification, the BI is supplementing my current income. I'm not sitting on my ass all day, I already work - so I'm not receiving the full $1400. I'm not even receiving $1000/month from this program. It's supplementing me to get up to a living wage. And giving me a chance to work and build my career so I won't have need for this program eventually. 

Okay, I hope that clarifies. I'll keep on answering questions. RIP my inbox.

EDIT 3: I have to leave now for work. I think I'm going to let this sit. I might visit in the evening after work, but I think for my own wellbeing I'm going to call it a day with this. Thanks for the discussion, Reddit!"

I’ve been acting for a long time, so you probably know me as others too. I’m also playing Bob Fosse in FX’s new series Fosse/Verdon, which is a ton of fun. Everyone should check it out.

I don’t have any social media accounts to post this from, so here’s proof that I am me:

[https://truepic.com/vroh7zfp](https://truepic.com/vroh7zfp)

I’ve wanted to do something like this for a while now and heard about this site from a bunch of people. Then my good friend, Alex Rockwell, asked me if I’d like to help him with his fundraiser campaign for his latest movie, Sweet Thing. We decided this would be a good time for me to reach out to my fans while getting a little extra noise going for his project, which stars his two talented kids alongside Will Patton and Karyn Parsons. For those of you who aren’t familiar, Alex is one of the most creative, hard-working independent filmmakers out there. We’ve worked together three times (In The Soup, 13 Moons, and Louis & Frank). Each one was a was lot of fun. He’s a pleasure to be around, and I always get excited when I hear that he’s got something in the works. I met his ex-wife, Jennifer Beals, in an acting class years ago, and I’ve been great friends with her and Alex since.

I’d tell you about Sweet Thing, but I think it’s best to let Alex do that himself. Just know that the film so far looks incredible, and they just need a bit more juice to get it fully out there. So check out the video and read about the film on their Kickstarter: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?)

I’m throwing in some rewards for the Kickstarter campaign, all of which you can find on their page, but include things like signed photos, custom voicemails, coffee hang outs, and more! Steve Buscemi, and Jennifer Beals are helping out too. Same, obviously, with Will and Karyn.

But anyway, I’m here for more than just promotion, I’m here to have fun with you all! Let’s get to it!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hey Reddit! I have to log off now, I only had about an hour to spare, and answering these questions took longer than I had expected. Apologies, there were some great comments I never got to.

But the conversation doesn't have to end here! Check out Alex Rockwell's kickstarter Sweet Thing (here's the link again: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1328225661/sweet-thing?)) and look out for my rewards. Maybe we can continue on in person! Over coffee? Lunch? Whatever works for you, it's all on the kickstarter page!

Thanks! I had a blast."

##[I’m Letitia Plummer, and I’m running for Texas’s 22nd congressional district seat.](http://imgur.com/yyT6bKc.jpg)

Three years ago, my ex-husband legally stole my infant son, Alex, from me. At a certain point, pregnancy can become risky for both a woman and a child, so we decided to have a child through a surrogate mother. Texas is a very surrogate-friendly state, so I felt safe going through this process.

Since my then-husband was a criminal defense attorney by trade, I left the legal papers to him. What I didn’t know was that for the intended parent to have any legal rights to a child, certain papers must be filed by certain deadlines. But, my then-husband didn’t file any of those papers for my parental rights. So even though my name was on the birth certificate of my child, I wasn’t his parent in the eyes of the law.

My husband knew this. But when we started the process of divorce, I had no idea. I found out through the mediation process. I remember my lawyer walking out of the room, and telling me, “Letitia, I don’t know how to say this to you, but there’s nothing you can do. You literally have to walk away, and you’ll never see him again.” That was pretty crazy, and pretty soul-crushing to me. The last time I saw Alex was when he was 2 months old.

So, I did the only thing I could think to do: change the law so this could never happen to another intended parent again. It started with me, writing down on a piece of paper what could have been different, so my then husband wouldn’t have been able to accomplish what he did. But, since I’m not a lawyer—I’m a dentist—I didn’t know how to put it in the right legal jargon. So I had a friend help me with that, and together, we took it to the Texas Family Law Foundation, who stood by my side to write legislation to protect the rights of intended parents for surrogate children in the event of a dissolution of marriage. And we got it passed.

---

##This is the reason I got into politics, activism, and advocacy. My nightmare empowered me, in a way. You don’t need to be a doctor or a lawyer, you just need to be a regular person who has gone through something in their life. We have all experienced injustice and pain, and we can all use that to fuel action to create a better community and country. The key is taking action in whatever you can, and find the avenues where action is possible.  

---

Now, my best avenue for action is running for Congress. So, I’m running to represent Texas’s 22nd congressional district. I will fight as hard as I can for my district as I will for my son, who I will likely never see until he is 18 years old. And there’s a lot I can do for my district, and a lot I’ve already done. Here’s one recent example:

Right after Harvey happened, I was sitting in my living room and having a bit of survivor's guilt, watching the devastation unfold all around us. I called around to nearby churches and shelters to see what they were missing—but they were all full. Nobody was accepting any more materials. And I remembered seeing on TV the stacks and stacks of clothing piled on the tables. It occurred to me—if your house is flooded and all your possessions destroyed, though you’re grateful, you realistically don’t have time or energy to go digging through those mounds. So nobody was taking a thing.

I thought, “let me create something that allows people to have their dignity back, and allows them to shop for clothes instead of dig.” So, we created the Harvey Relief Boutique in my Pearland office. We accepted donations of clothes, cleaning supplies, and water—things that people needed. A friend volunteered a gallery space for us to use. We created a store, put everything on hangers, and sorted it all by size. We didn’t charge for a single thing, but we gave them a dignified way to get the clothes they need in a safe space. In one week, we were able to give away over 1,200 items. I’m really proud of that.

After that, we moved all the remaining items back to my office, and then Hurricane Maria happened, which was catastrophic for the US Virgin Islands. One of my sorority sisters was from St. Croix, and I heard through the grapevine that she was packing a container to send to her country. So, we gave her the remaining items, and they all went to St. Croix—about 1,000 items in all. In two weeks, we supported two American communities—both my home and a community I’ve never known, and never visited, but one made up of my fellow Americans.

My point here is not to brag and boast. It’s just not as hard to make a difference as politicians make it out to be. So when you see things happening your world that are not quite right, that we want to change, you sit down and figure out how you can change it, and then you try to put things into play to change it.  And if we did that as an entire country, then we’d be in a whole different America right now. We wouldn’t be talking about uninsured people, we wouldn’t be caught off guard by four category 4 hurricanes, and we’d be dealing with climate change—we’d be doing something.  

---

###So please, Ask Me Anything. I’d appreciate the opportunity to get to know you better, and to let you get to know me. Here are some things I think you should ask about: I’m a small business owner—ask me about the vital role small businesses in injecting dollars into our communities or how absurdly difficult it is to get an SBA loan. Ask me about how I think we can get our country to be less discouraged and hopeless. Ask me about surrogacy law (I know it like the back of my hand now). Ask me about how I’ll support all families, including and especially alternative family models. Of course, you can ask me about anything else too.

I’m Rick Smith. I’m a father, a CEO, an Arizonan, and an author. When I was in college, two of my friends were shot and killed. That experience made me start to think about nonlethal weapons and whether they could be made a reality. Years later, I worked together with a [former NASA scientist](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Cover) to develop the Taser weapon—and from that work came a company that today is listed on the [NASDAQ stock exchange](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aaxn).

In the show Star Trek, the [phaser](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Phaser) weapon could be set to stun—and after my friends were killed, I started to dive deeply into the technology of weapons that could incapacitate without killing. I’ve spent my entire life trying to achieve the goal of “obsoleting the bullet,” and I think we’re closer than ever to a world in which killing is a thing of the past.

I’ve spent decades on this topic, and because the issues are so sensitive and complex, I dove a little bit deeper these past few years and wrote a book about it, called [THE END OF KILLING](https://www.amazon.com/End-Killing-Technologies-Humanitys-Problem/dp/1989025536). I think we can end the acceptability of killing in my lifetime, and as crazy as that sounds, I think it’s the crazy ideas that fire up people’s ambitions and energies.

I’m thrilled to be here and answer questions. I’ve been an entrepreneur for a long time, so I’m happy to answer any questions about building a business, the field we work in, technology, or anything else. So feel free to fire away!

By diving deep into picking ingredients, knife skills, how to build great dishes and presentation, taking you through my own recipes for everything from lobster ravioli to beef wellington and I promise not to yell at you (too much). Ask me Anything ….

edit: I am in a very happy and healthy relationship of course my fiancé knows i was escorting!!-Australian humour

I quit escorting about 2 years ago.  I am in Australia where sex work is legal and decriminalised. No matter the terms used for marketing purposes, all sex work is work. 

I am currently 6 months pregnant in my right vagina side (right uterus) mods have verified my condition with my medical records and ID. You can also see it in a video on my only fans if you really wish.

I have one labia (one entry) and then it immediately splits into two a right side and left side. Please see the diagram i drew below! If I open my legs and labia, there is a hole to left and a wall and then a hole to the right (a right and left vagina which go into their own seperate system)

My bump which will always sit far to my right side as he's in the right uterus. I've been told as he grows he might move over a bit but will always be right:
https://imgur.com/a/KTK7p81 

&#x200B;

Hey everyone, I was born with uterus didelphys: A condition where I was born with an extreme mutation I have two vaginas, each with their own cervix, uterus and one ovary attached to each side. One is uterus is far to my right side and one far to my left side. I used one vagina for escorting and one side for personal sex. I no longer escort I create OF content, and am now 6 months pregnant in my right vagina (with my fiancée).


**Explanation**

I have 2 completely independent reproductive systems. From the outside it initially looks like one normal vagina but immediately when i open my legs there is one that goes right and one that goes left. I have one clitoris but 2 G-Spots, orgasms in my right vagina are way better.

I found out when I was 20 I went to have a termination and the doctors couldn't find the embryo. After an internal exam they found the entire other system with the embryo still remaining in the other uterus I had to have a second termination in the other side (very emotional), due to the position the doctor accidentally punctured by bowel it wasn't a nice experience. I always knew something was wrong though since i was 14, tampons never worked!

**Impacts**

I cant take birth control, IUDs don't fit as both uteruses are very small (half the size of a singular regular uterus), mine are also strange shapes.

As I said I require two tampons, hormones regulate my cycles. Fertility with this condition is always unknown. I require 2 STD (sexual health checks) one in each vagina and i require 2 pap smears (lucky me), I can get thrush for example only in one side and not the other.

**Escorting with 2 vaginas**

I worked as a  independent escort in Australia for about 8 years and i was able to use one vagina for 'work' and one for my bf so technically thats not cheating right! ( this is aussie humour- my partner of course knew!) Occasionally I'd show clients the two of them and blow their mind further haha! When a person locates one vagina they often don't look to the right or left and notice a second. I did once have a gynaecologist client and he picked it straight away, the sexy booking turned into more of a medical exam which was bizarre. He was fascinated, its not something professionals will maybe come across. It was really handy for work (escorting), certain guys were better for me in a certain side, if one side needed a break or a time out I could use the other.

\*\* when i was single i used both for work, in a relationship i used one for work\*\*

**Sex and pregnancy**

I prefer my right vagina usually!

I am currently 6 months pregnant in my right uterus i was told by a specialist after a few tests to only get pregnant in the right (its stronger) my uterus is larger and cervix 'better' however there is a huge risk of falling pregnant in both sides at the same time (the babies could even be about 3 weeks difference in age).

&#x200B;

I hope you enjoy my bizarre story! Feel free to ask any questions, I'm very open on my twitter and there is a couple of videos of my 2 vaginas on my onlyfans. There is an imgur link above with my medical records.

Secondly I only came out publicly with my condition very recently and have just begun to film them a lot more.

I am a diamond geek, Stanford CS grad, and the accidental founder and CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/). We pressure cook carbon into diamond at a million PSI and 1500°C, and then we make [custom made\-to\-order jewelry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AsG0sy_INQ) with the diamonds. In addition, we supply diamond components to [Rolls\-Royce](https://www.press.rolls-roycemotorcars.com/rolls-royce-motor-cars-pressclub/article/detail/T0280450EN/adamas-collection-takes-rolls-royce-black-badge-further-into-the-darkness?language=en) and [Koenigsegg](https://www.koenigsegg.com/the-cars-of-salon-prive-2016/) (maker of the fastest production car on Earth @ 284mph)

Here's a [recent CNBC story](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/ada-diamonds-sells-lab-grown-diamonds-and-jewelers-cant-tell.html) about my startup and the lab diamond industry.

I believe laboratory grown diamonds are the future of fine jewelry, but also an important technology for a plethora of functional applications. There are medical, industrial, scientific, and computational (semiconducting and quantum!) applications of diamonds, and I'm happy to answer any questions about these emerging applications.

I also believe that [industrial diamond mining is now an unnecessary evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIADCIVOZxQ), and seek to accelerate the cessation of large\-scale diamond mining. We are well past 'peak diamond' and each year diamond mining becomes [more carbon\-intensive and less sustainable](https://www.adadiamonds.com/synthetic-diamond-facts-and-misconceptions/is-diamond-mining-sustainable).

If you have more questions, email me at [pguzzo@tampabay.com](mailto:pguzzo@tampabay.com) and follow me @PGuzzoTimes for further reports on Zion Cemetery.

&#x200B;

We are Tampa Bay Times reporter Paul Guzzo and photographer James Borchuck.

We spent nine months seeking answers about [Tampa’s first African-American burial ground](https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/nearly-400-people-buried-in-tampa-are-missing-what-happened-to-zion-cemetery/) – Zion Cemetery. How was it erased from this city’s history? And what happened to those once interred there?

Between 1913 and 1920, [382 people were buried in Zion](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/all-382-death-certificates-from-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/), according to our research.

A cemetery historian claims he found [747 death certificates](https://www.tampabay.com/tampa/zion-cemeterys-population-may-be-far-more-than-previously-thought-20190624/) for Zion.

Travel to Zion now and you'll see restaurant trucks and apartments. In December 1923, the Tampa Times called Zion one of the city's ""most prominent and greatly used burial places."" That didn't stop developers.  [In November 1951](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/key-dates-in-the-history-of-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/), as construction was underway on the Robles Park housing project, crews unearthed three caskets from Zion, but there was no further search of the property for more remains. After that, Zion was never publicly discussed again.

During our search, we pored over [tens of thousands of records](http://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/telling-the-story-of-tampas-forgotten-zion-cemetery/) dating back over a century. We still can't find the bodies.

Since our initial article was published, the city has partnered with the University of South Florida and the two owners of the former Zion land – the Tampa Housing Authority and Richard Gonzmart – to find out if more graves are there. That search will include ground penetrating radar.

[Two state senators](https://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/state-lawmakers-move-to-identify-preserve-forgotten-african-american-burial-sites-20190701/) have also announced they will draft a bill to find and protect African American cemeteries throughout Florida.

Representing and advocating for youth aging out of care over CBC radio: [https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-63-the-current/clip/15827801-ontario-proposing-redesign-young-people-age-care-system](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-63-the-current/clip/15827801-ontario-proposing-redesign-young-people-age-care-system) I was nervous.

&#x200B;

I have issues with being concise so the following text is me attempting to super-oversimplify my life.

My mother had me when she was very young, raised me alone, and her parent was probably the worst. Physical and verbal abuse, narcissism, zero attempt at emotional understanding, etc etc.

All of that trauma, along with living in a very dangerous neighbourhood, created a damaged young girl; and that damaged young girl needed to raise a child.

She developed a habit, later addiction, to drinking.  I told my principal; he ended up calling Children's Aid Society of Toronto (basically Toronto's CPS) and they put me in a home with a different parent.

It didn't work in that home so they put me in another.

And then another.

You get the idea.

Since birth, I've been slowly cracking down the science of the parental authoritative figure. (Suitably titled ""Assholeology"")

My experiences have given me issues with self image, motivation, fear of failure, fear of being a bad person, etc.

I have ADHD, a Non-Verbal Learning Disorder, and mild anxiety. They were all diagnosed less than a year ago and each played a special part in making things hellish.

And now I have to speedrun a healthy human mentality before I start college.

The questions I would like to ask him:

**Edit:** I realised that some questions were way out of place, therefore I replaced/edited some of them. There's a fine line between being nice and inappropriate.

1. If you could star in a remake of a popular movie, which one would you choose?

2. What are your goals in life at the moment and how are you thinking of accomplishing them?

3. How do you feel about working together with Danny Boyle and the set of actors on the upcoming FX series ""Trust""?

4. What is your favourite thing to do in your spare time?

5. If you had to chose only one movie to watch for the rest of your life, which one would it be?

I don't think Brendan has any official social media accounts so I think the only way to reach him is to contact his agencies, or of course if someone who sees this knows him and tells him about it. 

His agencies:

[Brillstein Entertainment](http://www.bepmedia.com/) | [Gersh](http://gershproduction.com/contact/)

As he seems to be having a rough time at the moment ([sad interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDYz4C5mxjs&t=915s), [Article about his annual alimony payments of 900,000$](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2279244/Broke-Brendan-Fraser-fights-reduce-alimony-child-support-payments-ex-wife.html) for anyone interested), he is not the easiest man to reach.

fad232,"Since 1983, I have lived, worked and raised a family in a progressive, egalitarian, income-sharing intentional community (or commune) of 100 people in rural Virginia. AMA.",25361,0.72,8803,2020-02-27 20:13:02,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fad232/since_1983_i_have_lived_worked_and_raised_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fad232/since_1983_i_have_lived_worked_and_raised_a/,self.IAmA,0,19,,text,False,False,False,"Hello Reddit!

My name is Keenan Dakota, I have lived at Twin Oaks, an income-sharing, intentional community in rural Virginia for 36 years, since 1983. I grew up in northern Virginia, my parents worked in government. I went to George Mason University where I studied business management. I joined Twin Oaks when I was 23 because I lost faith in the underpinnings of capitalism and looking for a better model. I have stayed because over time capitalism hasn't looked any better, and its a great place to raise children. While at Twin Oaks, I raised two boys to adulthood, constructed several buildings, managed the building maintenance program, have managed some of the business lines at different times.

[Proof this is me](https://imgur.com/9PMIYvv). [A younger photo of me at Twin Oaks.](https://www.twinoaks.org/photo-gallery/people-pets-twinoaks/portraits-oakers-friends?i=w_keenan) [Here is a video interview of me about living at Twin Oaks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzaAmgFS7B4) [Photo of Twin Oaks members at the 50th anniversary.](https://www.twinoaks.org/images/igallery/resized/1701-1800/50thAnniversaryGroupPic_perAaron-1715-3600-1200-100-c.jpg)

Some things that make life here different from the mainstream:

* The labor system - all work is considered equal, whether you are earning income for the community or not. Cooking/cleaning counts the same as planning the annual budget. Also, you don't have to do the same job all week - your day can be a mix of indoor and outdoor work, you have freedom to arrange your day, and you can gain skills in a wide array of tasks and trades.
* Non-gender binary, queer and trans people are very welcome at Twin Oaks. People introduce themselves with their pronouns and a significant number of our members go by they/them.
* Verbal consent culture is very important here. It is not okay to touch anyone without asking.
* Nudity and partial nudity is allowed in some parts of the farm, such as in the sauna, swimming hole, on the hiking trails, etc.
* Our social norms prohibit using phones in common areas when other members are present, with the exception of a few cafe-style spaces.
* Every day we provide a home-cooked, plant-based lunch and dinner with options for special diets including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and no onions & garlic.
* Raising kids here is easier. Some of the time that parents spend raising their children counts towards their labor quota. Many of the kids are home-schooled or ""[unschooled](https://www.naturalchild.org/articles/guest/earl_stevens.html)"", and they spend more time outside than in front of a screen. The kids have no problem passing the state's annual standardized test to move onto the next grade level.
* We have a shared clothing resource called Commie Clothes, which is like a free thrift store. Borrow something and then return it dirty, and it gets washed and re-hung up.

More about [Twin Oaks](https://www.twinoaks.org/about-twinoaks-community/welcome):

Twin Oaks is an [intentional community](http://www.ic.org/) in rural central Virginia, made up of around 90 adult members and 15 children. Since the community's beginning in 1967, our way of life has reflected our values of cooperation, sharing, nonviolence, equality, and ecology.

We do not have a group religion; our beliefs are diverse. We do not have a central leader; we govern ourselves by a form of democracy with responsibility shared among various managers, planners, and committees. We are self-supporting economically, and partly self-sufficient. We are income-sharing. Each member works 42 hours a week in the community's business and domestic areas. Each member receives housing, food, healthcare, and personal spending money from the community.

We have open-slots and are accepting applications for new members. All prospective new members must participate in a [three-week visitor program](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/visitor-program). Applicants to join must leave for 30 days after their visit while the community decides on their application.

We offer a $5 tour on Saturdays of the property, starting in March. [More info here.](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/saturday-tours)

Ask me anything!

TL;DR: Opted out of the rat-race and retired at 23 to live in the woods with a bunch of hippies.

EDIT: Thanks for all the questions! If you want some photos of the farm, you can check out our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/twinoakscommunity/?hl=en).

EDIT2: I'm answering new, original questions again today. Sort by new and scroll through the trolls to see more of my responses.

EDIT3: We DO have food with onion & garlic! At meals, there is the regular food, PLUS alternative options for vegan/vegetarian/no gluten/no onions & garlic.

EDIT4: Some of you have been asking if we are a cult. No, we are not. We don't have a central leader or common religion. Here are [characteristics](http://cultresearch.org/help/characteristics-associated-with-cults/) of cults, FYI.

Edit: Yikes!  Did I mention that I am 60?  Reddit is not my native land.  I don't understand the hostile, angry and seemingly deliberately obtuse comments on here.  And Soooo many people! 

Anyway, to the angry crowd: Twin Oaks poses no threat to anyone, we are 100 people out of a country of 330 million?  Twin Oaks reached its current maximum population about 25 years ago, so not growing fast, or at all. Members come and go from Twin Oaks.  There are, my guess is, 800 ex-members of Twin Oaks, so we aren't holding on to everyone who joins—certainly, no one is held against their will.  

Twin Oaks is in rural Virginia, but we really aren't insular, isolated, gated or scared of the mainstream culture. We have scheduled tours of the whole property. Local government officials, like building inspectors, come to Twin Oaks with some frequency. People at Twin Oaks like to travel and manage to do so. I personally, know lots of people in the area, I am also a runner, so I leave the property probably every day. There are lots of news stories about Twin Oaks over the years.  If you are worried about Twin Oaks, maybe you could go read what the mainstream  (and alternative) media have to say.

Except about equality Twin Oaks is not particularly dogmatic about anything.  (I know some people at Twin Oaks will disagree with that statement.)  Twin Oaks isn't really hypocritical about Capitalism, Socialism, or Communism, we just don't identify those concepts as something that we are trying to do.  Twin Oaks is not trying to DO Communism, we are trying to live a good life with equally empowered citizens—which has led us to try to maintain economic parity among members.  Communists also do that. In making decisions in the community I don't remember anyone trying to support or oppose an idea due to excess or insufficient Communism, Socialism, or Capitalism. In most practical senses those words aren't useful and don't mean anything.  So, no need to hammer Twin Oaks for being insufficiently pure, or hypocritical.

Twin Oaks is very similar to the Kibbutz in Israel. If anyone has concerns or questions about what would happen if places like Twin Oaks suddenly became much larger and more common, read about the history of the Kibbutz, which may have grown to possibly 1% of the population at their largest?  There was and is no fight with Capitalism from the kibbutz—or with the State.  My point is—not a threat.

To the other people who think that the ideas of Twin Oaks are interesting, I want you to know it is possible to live at Twin Oaks (or places like Twin Oaks) and happily live ones entire life.  There is no central, critical failing that makes the idea not work. And plenty of upside. But do lots of research first.  Twin Oaks maintains a massive web site.  (Anyway, it takes a long time to read.)  

But what I would like to see is more people starting more egalitarian, income-sharing communities.  I think that there is a need for a community that is designed and built by families, and who also share income, and provide mutual support with labor and money. If you love this concept, maybe consider gathering together other people and starting your own.

Ideologically speaking:

\-Ecology: the best response to ecological problems is for humans to use fewer resources.  The easiest way to use fewer resources is to share resources. Living communally vastly cuts down on resource use without reducing quality of life. 

\-Equality: ideologically speaking, most people accept the idea that all humans have equal rights, but most social structures operate in ways that are fundamentally unequal. If we truly believe in equality then we ought to be willing to put our bodies where our ideology is.  In a truly equal world, the issues of sexism and racism and all other forms of discrimination would, essentially, not exist.

\-Democracy: Twin Oaks uses all manner of decision-making models and tools to try to include everyone and to keep people equally empowered.  There is no useful word for this. We do use a majority vote sometimes, as a fallback.  But sometimes we use consensus.  We sometimes use sociocracy (dynamic governance). The word ""Isocracy"" (decision-making among equals), would be useful to describe Twin Oaks' decision-making model, but Lev in Australia has written an incomprehensible ""definition"" on Wikipedia, that he keeps changing back when someone corrects it.

\-Happiness: The overarching goal of all ideologies is to make people happy, right?  I mean, isn't it? Capitalism is based upon the belief that motivation is crucial to human aspiration and success (and therefore more happiness).  Under Capitalism, equality is a detriment because it hinders motivation  (less fear of failure, or striving for success). Twin Oaks believes that humans are happier when they are equal, and equally empowered. So the place to start up the ladder of happiness is to first make everyone equal.  Well, Twin Oaks is mainly still working on that first step.

EDIT5: Some have asked about videos - here are links to documentaries about Twin Oaks by [BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7in_Iqnqjo), [VICE](https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/have-you-ever-wanted-to-drop-out-of-capitalism/59c55d0ce0c06cfb6eaaa3ef) and [RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIvSltuY_k)."

I arrived in the United States in 1949 in pursuit of achieving the American Dream. After I became a citizen I was able to work on engineering projects including the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launcher. As a strong anti-Communist I was proud to have the opportunity to work in the defense industry. Later I started an engineering company with my brother without any money and 48 years later the company is still going strong. In my book I also discuss my observations about how Soviet propaganda ensnared a generation of American intellectuals to becoming sympathetic to the cause of Communism.

I’m currently the founder and CEO of [Block Party](https://blockpartyapp.com), a consumer app to help solve online harassment. Previously, I was a software engineer at Pinterest, Quora, and Facebook. 

I’m most known for my work in tech activism. In 2013, I helped establish the standard for tech company diversity data disclosures with a Medium post titled [“Where are the numbers?”](https://medium.com/@triketora/where-are-the-numbers-cb997a57252) and a Github repository collecting data on women in engineering.

Then in 2016, I co-founded the non-profit [Project Include](https://projectinclude.org/) which works with tech startups on diversity and inclusion towards the mission of giving everyone a fair chance to succeed in tech.

Over the years as an advocate for diversity, I’ve faced constant/severe online harassment. I’ve been stalked, threatened, mansplained and trolled by reply guys, and spammed with crude unwanted content. Now as founder and CEO of Block Party, I hope to help others who are in a similar situation. We want to put people back in control of their online experience with our tool to help filter through unwanted content.

Ask me about diversity in tech, entrepreneurship, the role of platforms to handle harassment, online safety, anything else.

**About a decade and a half ago, my company came under** [**short seller attack**](https://rick-axon.medium.com/i-run-a-public-company-5b6347fc0b1f)**.** We faced a highly-coordinated PR and legal campaign, and it almost brought the company down. What made no sense was that our company was thriving, on track for its best year yet and consistently crushing analyst expectations. We discovered in time that the shorts had worked the media, contacted regulators, colluded with someone in our company, and timed their trades just before bad news broke.

The damage was significant. **More than a billion dollars in shareholder equity vanished, much of it into the pockets of the short sellers.** These attacks can get personal, too. At one point, I faced death threats and moved in order to keep my family safe.

**I know other executives who have equally brutal stories about short attacks. But we don't talk about them.** Our lawyers urge us to settle; our comms people urge silence. No one wants to be on the wrong side of a short attack. But seeing what WSB did these past few weeks made me want to speak out.

This is a long overdue fight, and I'm happy to answer questions about what I went through and how we can fix the system so others don't have to go through it. There's actual reforms needed here, and some of them are common sense and simple. And of course, happy to talk about anything else on your minds—entrepreneurship, Arizona, Star Wars, or all of the above.

So, if you guys are interested in this..  I'll do the typing, and they'll field your questions.   
   
***   
   
***About Us***:    
We are a team of local Central African + foreign expat staff in the Chinko Reserve (bordering Congo & South Sudan) trying to save wildlife from the militarized rebel poachers. We train and deploy rangers to hunt down these smugglers who have killed the majority of game wildlife and attack the local villages. Using aircraft, we support the rangers from above. Though, with the recent accident, along with the constant threat of armed poachers and rebel groups like Kony's LRA child army.. we are up against it!!   
   
Our founder first conceived the project in 2012 while he was falsely imprisoned for a massacre he discovered and tried to report! (Link below) In the last 30 years, poaching has driven the elephant population from 60,000 down to only a couple 100! However, In a very short time, Chinko has cleared a 3,000 sq/km ""core protection zone"" of all activity, & wildlife have seen significant rises. Now, we are trying to expand further into the reserve, which at 17,600 sq/km is almost as big as Kruger national park, and virtually untouched!  
   
   
***Fundraising***  
With the loss of our ULM, we started this campaign in the hopes to quickly get our operation back up to 100% . The few expats here have spent the majority of the last years in the bush & never tried a crowdfunding medium. I, while NOT a professional PR guy for this organization, have been an avid redditor for years. So I convinced the boss that this could be a possible venue for fundraising if people are interested. (Included proof below).

I’m Monique. Two years ago I was working a typical corporate job in Cincinnati, Ohio. This was my “dream” job after college, but after a few years there, I realized I hated it. I was too chicken to quit without having a “Plan B”, so I spent my lunch hour writing lists of what I could do next. I wrote about how I could be more optimistic about my current job. I wrote lists of what I enjoyed doing. Skills I wanted to learn. What to do next. One day, I wrote a list about “10 businesses I could start in a day”. I showed the list to my boyfriend that night at dinner, and he liked one of the ideas. We started working on it as soon as we cleared the dishes.

We each took $1,000 from our savings to start the business. For the next three months, we worked on our business whenever we weren’t at our corporate jobs. Within weeks, I realized I had been naïve, and that there was an enormous sacrifice to starting a business. I stopped volunteering. I lost touch with a lot of friends. I stopped working out. I gained weight. My boyfriend and I fought a lot about the business and I questioned whether what we were doing was worth it.

Two years ago today, we took our website live. Since then, we’ve had plenty of highs and lows. We've both quit our corporate jobs, moved from Ohio to New Jersey, hired people, fired people, and made a ton of mistakes. But we’ve also managed to grow our business and grow as people. We’re proud to provide a living for several employees, and send our customers a product that they love.

You might have heard about me because I’ve been challenged by reporters to make lots of predictions.  For example, Newsweek challenged me to predict the Oscars (link) and I was 76% accurate, which beat the vast majority of professional movie critics.  

TechRepublic challenged me to predict the Kentucky Derby (http://www.techrepublic.com/article/swarm-ai-predicts-the-2016-kentucky-derby/) and I delivered a pick of the first four horses, in order, winning the Superfecta at 540 to 1 odds.

So, on to business...here's the copypasta.

[First AMA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pe2bd/iama_vacuum_repair_technician_and_i_cant_believe/)

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/donttouchmycoffee/)
Here's some basics to get you started:


* Dollar for dollar, a bagged vacuum, when compared to a bagless, will almost always:

1) Perform better (Actual quality of cleaning).

2) Be in service for much longer.

3) Cost less to repair and maintain (Often including consumables).

4) Filter your air better.

Virtually every vacuum professional in the business chooses a bagged vacuum for their homes, because we know what quality is.
Things you should do to maintain your vac, regularly:

1) Clear your brush roller/agitator of hair and fibers. Clear the bearing caps as well, if possible. (monthly)

2) Change your belts before they break. This is important to maintain proper tension against the agitator. (~ yearly for ""stretch"" belts)

3) Never use soap when washing any parts of your vacuum, including the outer bag, duct system, agitator, filters, etc. Soap attracts dirt, and is difficult to rinse away thoroughly.

* Types of vacs:

1) Generally, canister vacs are quieter and more versatile than uprights are. They offer better filtration, long lifespans, and ease of use. They handle bare floors best, and work with rugs and carpets, as well.

2) Upright vacuums are used mostly for homes that are entirely carpeted. Many have very powerful motors, great accessories, and are available in a couple of different motor styles. Nothing cleans shag carpeting like the right upright.

3) Bagless vacs are available in a few different styles. They rely on filters and a variety of aerodynamic methods to separate the dirt from the air. In general, these machines do not clean or filter as well as bagged vacuums. They suffer from a loss of suction, and tend to clog repeatedly, if the filters are not cleaned or replaced often.

4) Bagged vacuums use a disposable bag to collect debris, which acts as your primary filter, before the air reaches the motor, and is replaced when you fill it. Because this first filter is changed, regularly, bagged vacuums tend to provide stronger, more consistent suction.

My last, best piece of advice is to approach a vacuum, like any appliance; Budget for the best one you can get. Buy one with idea you will maintain it, and use it for many years. And, for the love of Dog, do not buy from late-night infomercials or door-to-door salesmen! Stay out of the big-box stores, and visit your local professional who actually knows what they're talking about."

About a year ago, I did an [AMA about a former mining town I purchased with a friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bf5z5q/iama_guy_who_purchased_a_380_acre_ghost_town_with/) called Cerro Gordo. You can see some [photos of the town here](https://instagram.com/brentwunderwood)

I'm currently at the town filling in for our caretaker who has been home for past 3 weeks. I'm up here socially distancing and currently snowed in with at least 4 ft of snow on our 7 mile road back to civilization. Seemed like a great time to do an AMA!

We've done a number of renovations since buying and the last year or so has been filled with lots of adventures and people.

For more background on the property:

Cerro Gordo was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles.

The silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.

The Los Angeles News once wrote:

“What Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.”

In total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.

Currently, there are about 22 buildings still standing over 380 acres. We've been in process of restoring them.

More background: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/cerro-gordo-ghost-town-california.html

The plan was to develop a hospitality destination where people would stay overnight. COVID-19 and other things are impacting that plan heavily.

8kwxk3,IAmAn Air Traffic Controller. The FAA will be hiring more controllers next month. This is a 6 figure job that does not require a college degree. AMA.,24505,0.89,4193,2018-05-21 06:15:26,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8kwxk3/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8kwxk3/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/,self.IAmA,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"************ UPDATE October 2 ************

For those of you still waiting for an email, it looks like another batch is going out today. 

********** UPDATE September 25 ***********

It looks like the AT-SA email blasts are going out today. Check your inbox for an email from PsiOnline with instructions on setting up an account and scheduling your test date.

*********** UPDATE September 5 ***********

Nothing new to provide, just wanted to check in with everybody. So far the only emails that I have heard of going out are rejection letters. I believe the ATO is still processing applicants from the N90 bid that was posted just before the general announcement that most of you applied to. Just keep checking those emails for AT-SA information, and I’ll update here as soon as I hear of any being received.

************* UPDATE August 7 ************

I’m getting a lot of questions from people asking about the delay. I know this process is most likely unlike any other hiring process you have experienced. This will take a while. The standard delay between bid closure and AT-SA emails has been 1-2 months. The delay from application to receiving a class date for the academy can easily take a year longer. Obviously things could go quicker than that, but be prepared to do a lot of waiting. There isn’t much else for me to update as of now, but I will continue to update this post as the process moves along, as well as answer any DMs. 

************** UPDATE July 30 *************

The bid has closed. The next step will be waiting for the AT-SA email, which could take up to a couple months. In the meantime, [HERE](https://pointsixtyfive.com/xenforo/threads/atsa-compilation.545/) is a comprehensive guide detailing what to expect on the AT-SA. Huge props to those who contributed to it over on pointsixtyfive.com. 

************** UPDATE July 29 *************

The bid will be closing tonight at midnight EST.

********* UPDATE July 27 00:01 EST *********

[The bid is posted!](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/506307400) 

************** UPDATE July 26 *************

The day is finally here. The bid will open up at 12:01 EST tonight. Fingers crossed that the site doesn’t crash. 

************** UPDATE July 24 *************

*EDIT 1:55 PM CST*

The July 27 hiring date is confirmed. From the National Air Traffic Controllers Association:

“The #FAA is accepting applications nationwide beginning July 27 from people interested in becoming air traffic controllers. When the application link is available, NATCA will share it on social media &amp; member communications.

Applicants must be U.S. citizens, speak English clearly, and be no older than 30 years of age (with limited exceptions). They must have a combination of three years of education and/or work experience. They are also required to pass a medical examination, security investigation, and FAA air traffic pre-employment tests. Applicants must be willing to work anywhere in the U.S. Agency staffing needs will determine facility assignment.

Accepted applicants will be trained at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. Active duty military members must provide documentation certifying that they expect to be discharged or released from active duty under honorable conditions no later than 120 days after the date the documentation is signed.

Visit www.usajobs.gov to start building your application and www.faa.gov/Jobs for more information.”

*END EDIT*


The July 27 opening date seems to be as set in stone as can be. Supposedly the FAA is shooting for a rough cap of 5,500 applicants, however that number could change. They plan on giving a 24 hour advance notice to CLOSING the bid. If you’re profile and application isn’t already as complete as you can make it, I suggest getting it together within the next 2 days. 

************** UPDATE July 23 *************

Coming through in the clutch once again, u/someguyathq has said that the post date has been pushed to July 27 and the FAA will provide a 24 hour notice prior to the bid going live. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e2wor00?st=JJZ3BI9N&amp;sh=781facd8) to his comment.

************** UPDATE July 21 *************

I have been waiting to post another update until I had some concrete information, but at this point that is hard to come by. The latest information is that the FAA wants to try to open the bid on July 26 but is still waiting for the all clear from the Department of Transportation. It is not yet known if they plan on capping the number of applications they accept, so plan on first come first serve for the worst case scenario. As always, I will answer any questions and continue to update this thread. 

************** UPDATE July 12 *************

*EDIT 5:03 PM CST*

Another user who claims to work at HQ and has given solid information up to this point says that the bid will open the week of July 23. There will be no BQ and the bid will only stay open until they receive the maximum number of applications, which the user says will be around 5-6 thousand. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/8tm3ed/comment/e22ivd8?st=JJJ3NAK6&amp;sh=602624c2) to his post. 

*END EDIT*

As you have probably discerned by now, the bid will not be opening this week. The Department of Transportation was supposed to give the all clear this week, but as if this update they have yet to do so. We’re hoping that it will be posted by the end of this month, but as always nothing is confirmed. Unfortunately this delay is going to be just the first of many long waiting periods as you progress through the hiring process. I will continue to update this post with new information as it comes in, as well as respond to all of the DMs I receive. 

************** UPDATE July 6 **************

There is a possibility of the bid opening next week minus the Biographical Questionnaire. While this information is unconfirmed, it is believed by people close to the source to be accurate. Of course this could change (as you should be used to by now), but I wanted to give you all an update going into the weekend. Continue to follow this thread and USA Jobs for the most up to date information as I get it.

************** UPDATE June 29 *************

The June 27th public hiring announcement has been delayed while the FAA assesses how it will handle the hiring process moving forward. The administration is facing ongoing litigation regarding the Biographical Questionnaire (BQ) portion of the application. There is substantial pressure from the White House, Congress, and the media for the FAA to eliminate the BQ while developing a filtering method that is more effective and equitable for all. There is hope that this can be resolved within a few weeks; however, it could take longer. I will continue to keep this post updated with new information as soon as it is available. 

************** UPDATE June 27 *************

[The FAA has delayed the June 27 public announcement.](https://www.faa.gov/jobs/) I know all of you have been waiting for this day, and I will update this post as soon as I receive some new information.

************** UPDATE June 20 *************

There is currently a job posting for new hire ATC Trainees on USA Jobs. This bid will last through June 26. The FAA will use this bid to fill positions at New York TRACON (N90) in Westbury, New York.  *** This is ONLY OPEN to those who live within 50 statute miles of N90. ***

If you meet this criteria and wanted to stay in the NY area, you can apply to this bid. Understand, however, that you will be going to THE busiest airspace in the world. The reason the FAA is offering this direct bid is because the staffing is critical at this facility. This is due to an extremely high washout/burnout rate which is also causing mandatory 6 day work weeks.

From June 27 through July 2 the FAA will post the vacancy announcement open to ALL U.S. citizens for ALL locations, which is what this thread has been preparing you for. 

NOTES:
USAJobs now requires applicants to create a new account through login.gov to sign in to USAJobs before they can begin the electronic application. 

************** UPDATE June 7 **************

The open source bid will be open for applications from JUNE 27 to JULY 2. Pool 2 is for the General Public applicants (you). Once again, you will be applying for the “Air Traffic Control Specialist Trainee” position under series 2152. Once again, it is HIGHLY recommended that you use the resume builder on USA Jobs rather than upload a resume with a different format.

[Information about the job and requirements](https://www.faa.gov/jobs/career_fields/aviation_careers/) 

————————————————————————

To be eligible to apply in the upcoming hiring panel, you must be a US citizen, be under 31 years old, and have either 3 years of full time work experience, a bachelor’s degree, or a combination of both full time work experience and college credits.

Part of your application will be to take a Biographical Questionnaire. This is similar to personality tests you can find online. Once you’ve completed the application, you’ll have to wait a couple months to find out if you passed the BQ. If you didn’t, you’ll have to try again next time they open a hiring bid, which will most likely be next year. If you do pass, you will have to wait another 2-4 months to be scheduled to take the AT-SA. This is an 8 hour aptitude exam that you must pass to continue through the process. If you pass the AT-SA, you will get a Tentative Offer Letter around 2 months after that will include instructions on getting your medical completed, as well as setting up an appointment for a psychological evaluation. Once you’ve done that and your background check is completed, you’ll once again have to wait a few months to find out a class date for the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. We joke around that the FAA’s motto is “Hurry up and wait”, and it’s pretty much spot on. 

You will spend 3-4 months at the academy getting your initial training, the time difference being based on whether you were hired for Terminal (airport towers) or En Route (radar centers). At the end of your training you will take several examinations, which consist of you running simulated air traffic. If you fail, you lose your job. If you pass, you’ll get a list of facilities to choose from that can be anywhere in the country. YOU MUST BE WILLING TO RELOCATE. Once at your facility, you will continue your training on real traffic at your facility. This can take anywhere from 1-3 years, depending on your skill and the facility. 

I can’t stress enough how amazing this job is. You will make anywhere from $70,000 - $180,000 per year, depending on your facility. You will have a pension that will pay you around 40% of your highest 3 year gross pay average for the rest of your life, and a 401k that matches 5% (1 for 1 the first 3%, 1/2 for 1 for the other 2%). Mandatory retirement is at 56, but you can retire at 50 with full benefits. You will earn good vacation time, as well as 13 sick days per year. On any given 8 hour shift you will have anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. The worst part about the schedule is the rotating shift work, but it’s not that bad. 

Any other questions, please don’t hesitate to ask here or PM me. I would love to help as many people get into this field as possible. Most people have no idea that this is even a thing. "

I'm Colin Cantwell. Please be patient with me as I am 84 and this is my first time on Reddit.  You may not have heard about me, as I like to keep out of the limelight, but I'm sure you've seen projects I've worked on. I'm looking forward to getting to know you and answering your questions!

**A short list of my most favorite experiences are:**
* Being accepted to Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural school
* Working with NASA to inform the public on the first unmanned space flights
* Being Walter Cronkite's “Hal 9000” NASA connection during live broadcast of the first moon landing
* Inventing the first real color monitor for Hewlett Packard
* Writing my first book CoreFires - a labor of love 20 years in the making

**I've worked on the following movies & shows:**
* **Lead star ship designer for Star Wars** - I drew the original designs for the X-Wing, A-Wing, Star Destroyer, TIE Fighter, & Rebel cruisers. I was also the one who designed and sculpted the Death Star and gave it it's trench
* **2001, A Space Odyssey** - I worked closely with Stanley Kubrick and persuaded him not to start the movie with a 20 minute conference table discussion
* **Buck Rogers in the 25th Century**
* **Close Encounters of a Third Kind**
* **War Games**

I have a deep interest in science - especially quantum physics and space travel. I could not have picked a better time to have been born. So much has happened so quickly! Our dreams of space flight are maturing and I believe one day soon we’ll be exploring the next waiting wonders of our galaxy.

**Two short anecdotes to get us started -**
When I was a boy, I was diagnosed with TB as well as partial retinal detachment. The cure was to confine me to a dark room with a heavy vest across my chest to prevent coughing fits. I spent nearly TWO YEARS of my childhood immobilized in this dark room. Suffice to say, nothing else could slow me down after that!

George Lucas gave me the project of designing a “Death Star”. I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle. It would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and re-fill this depression. So, to save me the labor, I went to George and suggested a trench. He liked the idea so much that it became one of the most iconic moments in the film!

----
My latest project is a book series called *CoreFires*. I've made it available for free in the hopes that readers will find in it a sense of wonder and excitement. It's space science fiction of course! You can read the description [here](http://colincantwell.com/books2/)

You can see my original Pre-Star Wars artwork [here](https://colincantwell2.threadless.com)
My book is available for free [here](http://colin-cantwell.com/contest.html)
This also enters you in a contest for a free signed print of my original Pre-Star Wars star ship designs.
You can also get *CoreFires* for free on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/CoreFires-DEATH-Designer-Colin-Cantwell-ebook/dp/B01LYL9IH8/) for the next 3 days

I hope that's enough to get us started. AMA!

I'm a nurse who has been working at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, part of The Hackensack Meridian Health network, since 2016. I've been in the emergency department for the last two years. I was fired last Tuesday, 4/7/2020.

You can read about my termination here: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/coronavirus-health-workers-speak-out.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/coronavirus-health-workers-speak-out.html)

[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/xU0gLEy)

Last May, I became president of our nurse's union, HPAE Local 5058. Being president of a local means spending a lot of my non-working hours advocating and fighting for the nearly 1300 nurses in our facility. Adding to this responsibility were a number of attempts to ""harmonize"" benefits, standards, etc across our recently merged hospital system. Since last April, this has resulted in missing pay, impossible to understand paychecks, and a hacking of our health system that took down our computers for days. Most recently, the hospital decided to ""audit"" our paid time off in late March (during this pandemic), with many people losing time or going into negative balances. For example, my account said I had -111 hrs.

Needless to say, there's been a lot to deal with, and I've done everything in my power to try and ensure that the staff is respected and our issues are resolved. Problems multiplied during the hospital's response to Covid-19 and I, and the other nurses on the board, became increasingly outspoken. I guess some people didn't like that.

As you likely know, this is happening across the US and it has to stop. I'm not worried about myself, but I am worried about our nurses and staff (and all workers in this country) who are risking their lives for their jobs right now.

So, Reddit, ask me about any of the topics I've touched on, or anything else, and I'll do my best to answer. I'll even talk about Rampart.

I found a lump in my right breast when I was 14 and didn't think anything of it. I googled and just blew it off as puberty or something and ignored it. As I got older it grew and eventually was big enough that I could constantly feel it. I went to a urgent care place since I didn't have a primary care physician and they referred me to a breast health center. There they did an ultrasound and did a mammogram. After that they scheduled me for a biopsy in January of 2017.

The biopsy results came back as benign so I figured since I just started a new job I'll wait to get some time off and get it removed. I went to another surgeon (the other one left town and referred me to the new one) in August of 2017 when I had the time and money to get it taken out. On August 17th the doctor told me it was malignant and it was extremely rare for it to have been cancer, especially since I had the lump for so long. He set me up with an oncologist and I had scans and a mastectomy, because the first surgery was just removing the lump not the entire breast. The oncologist told me he didn't know if chemo would be beneficial after the mastectomy since there weren't many cases of it. We decided to go with 4 cycles of chemo to hopefully get rid of any cancer cells left behind after the surgeries.

I started chemo November 9th 2017 and it just ended on January 11th 2018. Now I go back to the oncologist Monday to see what we are doing next!

The TPP is a massive global deal between 12 countries, which was negotiated for years in complete secrecy, with hundreds of corporate advisors helping draft the text while journalists and the public were locked out. The text has been finalized, but it can’t become law unless it’s approved by U.S. Congress, where it faces an uphill battle due to swelling opposition from across the political spectrum. The TPP is branded as a “trade” deal, but its more than 6,000 pages contain a wide range of policies that have nothing to do with trade, but pose a serious threat to good jobs and working conditions, Internet freedom and innovation, environmental standards, access to medicine, food safety, national sovereignty, and freedom of expression.

I told Reddit my story and both your moral support and support in sales saved my company from going under. Now, thanks to a broker I met on Reddit, I have one last chance to get national distribution with Wal-Mart, who I’ll be pitching to tomorrow. And I have you guys to thank for that.

Over a year after I separated from my husband, he finally gave up trying to get me back and decided to hire someone to kill me instead. Luckily, the police were notified and an elaborate sting was set up to catch him, which included them pretty much faking my murder. Two days ago, my ex husband received a ten year sentence for conspiracy to commit murder.

If this looks familiar, I did do an AMA on this a while back, but was advised to take it down since the case wasn't completely settled at the time (posting it at the time was probably pretty stupid of me). Please forgive me if my formatting isn't perfect, I'm usually more of a lurker on Reddit.

This has gotten so much bigger than I ever expected. Please be patient with me, I am trying to answer as many questions as possible, and do so as coherently as possible.

EDIT: I see a lot of the same questions being asked in a lot of different places, and I'm really sorry that I haven't explained everything in a way that satisfies everyone. Here are the answers to some of the most repeated questions, for those of you who are getting a bit irate with my ineptitude in the comments:

1. No, I do not know anyone named Lambesis.
2. Yes, the children are his, they know only a few basic details about what happened, and they are handling it well, all things considered.
3. He tried to find a hitman by asking his friends, and one of them tipped off the police.
4. No, I was not trying to take any of his money, or even half of it, in the divorce. I only wanted him to leave me alone. 
5. The warning signs that made me leave in the first place are mostly included among this [list](http://www.newhopeforwomen.org/abuser-tricks)

EDIT 2: I just want to thank everyone for reading this and commenting. I've learned that my situation is nowhere near unheard of. Knowing that there are so many others out there who have been through similar things helps a lot. Also, I know a lot of you aren't completely satisfied with the answers that I could give, and I'm sorry that I don't know every detail, or if some details are a little too personal to discuss. This ended up being much bigger than I expected, and I did the best I could.

I’m giving away some of my original Star Trek memorabilia, tickets to upcoming events, and doing some exclusive one-on-ones with fans. I even started hosting my own mini-AMA before someone told me I should do it here! What sets StarPower apart from other sites is that it’s a monthly subscription rather than a flash-in-the pan. I know from working with non profits in the past that a constant, reliable revenue source is the dream compared to the booms and busts of traditional fundraising. I’m supporting the [Technology Access Foundation](http://techaccess.org/) and the [Planetary Society](http://planetary.org).

Welcome to our #SexWorkAMA!** 

I’m [Liara Roux](http://aboutliara.com). You may know me - my selfies have ended up on the front page a few times over the years! And you may be familiar with the discussion in the comments under them - many people have been surprised to find out [I’m a sex worker](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbkv7a/coming-out-as-a-sex-worker-liara-roux-personal-essay) and curious about what that means. 

Fans on here have asked for an AMA about my work - and seems now’s the time! I didn’t want to just talk about my personal experiences though. [Our community](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjbkp9/desiree-conference-canceled-fosta-sesta-sex) has been devastated in the wake of a string of [terrible government policies and laws](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpqvz/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking). We already were banned from a lot of internet platforms and it’s been getting worse - we’ve tracked over 150 sites and services that don’t allow sex workers, from PayPal to Skype or even AirBnB, in [a massive 90 page report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit). We’re worried [another upcoming “trafficking” bill](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/human-trafficking-banking-bill-sex-workers_us_5b045577e4b0740c25e5efd1) will result in many sex workers losing their bank accounts - and that’s not a fantastical worry; many people including myself have lost bank accounts in the past for being sex workers, regardless of the legality of their specific work.

Since stigma about our work and state violence against sex workers keeps many in the closet, it’s easy for prohibitionist organizations, law enforcement, and politicians to make up stories about our lives. Many cite all advertisements for sex work online as “instances of trafficking” or “sexual exploitation.” But our real lives are complicated and varied. 

Some of us do work that’s criminalized, some don’t. Some work in person, others make content for stores or work online or on a phone. Some of us work for day to day survival, or have worked under coercion or force, many of us work happily and safely for ourselves. People may be both a victim of prior abuse and now a consensual sex worker. Some of us are lucky to support ourselves, others work hard to support their families. We’re homeless and own homes. We’re working class and famous libertines - or sometimes one branded as the other to the public. What you see of us in public is never the whole story.


We’re coming together as a broader community to push for respect as workers and human beings, and fight for better working conditions and access to the same basic tools and government resources as everyone else. Not everyone loves sex work, but you don’t need to think something is “empowering” to want it to be safer. You don’t even need to respect their work to believe they deserve human rights.

There are many ways to be a sex worker, and there are also important topics to discuss with regards to safety and abuse in the industry. There are valuable lessons to learn from other countries - many people work in places where full service, in person sex work is legal or decriminalized. There are a lot of people in this fight - and it’s global. Today I’ve brought with me some other experts - and put out the invite on social media for more sex workers to join in!

This event had an open call. We’re not handpicking or gatekeeping, just checking to make sure people are who they say they are. Everyone’s experiences and words are their own. I’m not sure an AMA has been done with so many participants before, so we’ll see what happens!

Here’s who we are:

#**Why We’re Here**
[*by Ashley Lake*](https://twitter.com/_AshLake_)


We’re here today to go beyond the ad campaigns and celebrity PSAs to get into the real detail of the sex industry. For example, you’ve heard a lot about sex trafficking, something we all work hard to combat - we know how hard the job can be and no one should be forced into it! But a lot of myths and misconceptions about our industry end up hurting us *and* trafficking victims - we all know people who have been hurt or are no longer with us. It’s also possible for someone to be a survivor of abuse *and* a current sex worker - maybe one who loves their job, maybe one who hates it! But many of the loudest voices in the fight against trafficking are actually faith based organizations who believe the only way to help improve working conditions is to “rescue” sex workers through arrest.

Recently Congress passed a law titled (in the House and Senate) the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act. It sounds great on the surface - no one wants to stop sex trafficking more than sex workers - but the laws don’t actually do anything for trafficking victims at all! There’s no additional funding, no direct aid, no new studies, no task forces, not even more money for law enforcement - the only thing the law does is create additional crimes to do with websites “facilitating prostitution.” The [actual text of § 2421A](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1865/text) mentions “prostitution” 5 times and coercion or force (until now needed to define something as trafficking) zero times. Since the law hit, we’ve lost [valuable safety resources and sexual expression has suffered](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU/edit) - Craigslist even took down their personal ads! 

Here on reddit we [lost forums about sex work](http://reason.com/blog/2018/03/22/reddit-bans-escort-subreddits) as well. While this may seem like a victory to some, the truth is - [supported by empirical studies](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/online-ads-keep-sex-workers-safer-this-bill-could-make-those-ads-illegal_us_5ab16105e4b0decad044d0c0) - taking down these sites doesn’t help people in the sex trade - voluntarily or victims. The internet has [made the sex trade safer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/internet-making-sex-work-safer-report-finds).

[Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/qa-policy-to-protect-the-human-rights-of-sex-workers/), [the UN’s World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/sex_work/en/), [ACLU](https://prostitution.procon.org/view.source.php?sourceID=003633), and [Freedom Network USA](https://freedomnetworkusa.org/freedom-network-usa-supports-amnesty-internationals-call-to-decriminalize-sex-work/) (the largest network of anti-trafficking experts in America) all believe decriminalizing consensual sex work is key to combating trafficking - it means we can come to police when we know someone is being abused without worrying about being [abused at the hands of police](https://reason.com/blog/2017/10/13/cops-are-harvey-weinstein-of-sex-work) ourselves. We need to separate sex work from trafficking so funding goes to the right places and we can work together to save lives, because badly thought out laws actually [increase abuse and sex trafficking](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bjpqvz/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking).

[Go here](https://lbry.io/get).

**Post AMA Wrap Up**

This response has been absolutely amazing and tremendously encouraging to our team and we'll definitely report back as we progress. A lot of great questions that will keep us thinking about how to strike the right balance.

If you want to help keep content creation/sharing out of control of corporations/governments please [sign up here](https://lbry.io/get) and follow us over on /r/lbry. You guys were great!

**Who We Are**

Hanging out in our chat and available for questions is most of [founding and core members](https://lbry.io/team) of LBRY:

- Jeremy Kauffman (/u/kauffj) - chief nerd
- Reilly Smith (/u/LBRYcurationbot) - film producer and content curator
- Alex Grintsvayg (/u/lyoshenka) - crypto hipster
- Jack Robison (/u/capitalistchemist) - requisite anarchist college drop-out that once built guitars for Kiss
- Mike Vine (/u/veritasvine) - loudmouth
- Jason Robertson (/u/samueLBRYan) - memer-in-chief
- Nerds from MIT, CMU, RPI and more (we love you Job, Jimmy, Kay, and every Alex)

**What Is LBRY?**

LBRY is a new, completely open-source protocol that allows creators to share digital content with anyone else while remaining strongly in control – for free or for profit.

If you had the LBRY plugin, you’d be able to click URLs like lbry://itsadisaster (to stream the film starring David Cross) or lbry://samhyde2070 (to see the great YouTube/Adult Swim star's epic TEDx troll).

LBRY can also be viewed and searched on it’s own: [here’s a screenshot](https://i.sli.mg/9hqMto.png) 

Unlike every other corporate owned network, LBRY is completely decentralized and controlled by the people who use it. Every computer connected to and running LBRY helps make the network stronger. But we use the power of encryption and the blockchain to keep everything safe and secure.

Want even more info? Watch [LBRY in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjouYBEkQPY) or [read this ungodly long essay](https://lbry.io/what).

a9go6z,Looking for my son's heart. In Canada even though the donor and recipient want to meet you can't find each other.

Through the gift of life network in 24 hours we found recipients for 4 of his organs. 

While this was a difficult time for me now and then, I knew my son would have wanted to find something good out of this terrible accident. Initially I thought I would be able to contact the recipients and find out who they were but I misunderstood and we were only able to anonymously write each other after 6 months and only if we both wanted.  

I wrote the heart recipient first as that seems to be easier to do.  While I also wrote the kidney and liver recipient only the heart recipient has replied.  We have now exchanged 3 letters. The latest thank you coming a few days ago with a picture of his heartbeat.  I had sent him my sons with the request he send his back so I could have a tattoo made of my sons heart into his heart. 

 Letters I might add that must be void of names and places that could possibly help us find each other. They are screened vigilantly even though we have both expressed the desire to meet.  This to me is sad. 

 Although it's been such a difficult year,   here is what I know.  The heart recipient is 54 years of age. ( as am I) I know through his letters he has 2 children one is a girl. I know his brother died of a similar heart condition 7 years ago. He seems quite religious  as he thanks God and ""my donor's mother"" a lot.  

We just passed a year recently and I sent him a happy rebirthday letter. He has taken up gardening ( my son loved to garden and he cried when I told him this because he has just started to take this up and his son asked him if his new heart was a gardener in a previous life.   Ok,  wait. Now I know he has a son and a daughter. 

 I am in Brampton. I think he is in the GTA (greater Toronto area ) because he talked about coming into pick up my letter which implies nearby. A heart transplant is a rare thing. Someone has to know someone who had one September 25th 2017 ?  I haven't been able to do Christmas.  Thank you for your help. Ask me anything..

AMA!",23376,0.81,1812,2017-07-25 20:29:05,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6pgo2n/i_am_tom_turcich_687_days_16_countries_and_9600/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6pgo2n/i_am_tom_turcich_687_days_16_countries_and_9600/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"**My short bio:** What's up Reddit?!

Over two years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a five year, seven continent trek around the world.  In Texas I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWr8vkuALwh/?taken-by=theworldwalk), and we’ve been walking together ever since.  I’ve been walking for 687 days and have covered 9600 miles over fifteen countries. Currently I’m in Dublin, about to take on Europe and North Africa.

My previous AMA was a year ago and I was in Macará, Ecuador.  From Ecuador I walked through desert for months (and nearly lost my mind), did ayahuasca in the Peruvian jungle, climbed to 15,000 feet to cross the Andes, and stumbled upon the Argentinian Carnival.  After South America I took a ship to Antarctica where I took a plunge in the icy waters and kayaked beside humpbacks.

Savannah was four months old when I adopted her.  When she was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart.  Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running around at night.  In Central and South America it was fairly easy crossing borders with her.  To get her into Europe we spent a month in New Jersey doing her paperwork (which is easier now than it used to be apparently).  I’ve spent nearly every minute of every day with her since adopting her.  She’s my best friend and a great watch dog at night.

As to why I'm walking around the world, I had a friend, Anne Marie, who died at seventeen. I'd never been close to someone who died before. Her death reordered my understanding of the world. I suddenly saw life as something fragile and fleeting. I needed to make the most of the short time I had - I wanted adventure and to see the world. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around stuck in my head. So from seventeen to twenty-six I kept The World Walk my aim. I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility. By twenty-six I had enough saved that if I lived frugally I could walk while still paying off my student loans for two years.

However, about a month before leaving, the owner of [Philadelphia Sign](http://www.philadelphiasign.com/) reached out to me. He knew Anne Marie and wanted to support my walk. Now, Philadelphia Sign gives me enough money to see this thing through and donates a dollar a mile to AnneMarie’s scholarship fund.
If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly blog post.

**About CERN and the LHC**

[CERN](http://cern.ch) is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, located in Geneva, Switzerland. Its flagship accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has four main particle detectors: [ALICE](http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html), [ATLAS](http://atlas.ch), [CMS](http://cern.ch/cms) and [LHCb](http://cern.ch/lhcb-public). Nearly three years ago, CMS and ATLAS announced the discovery of a new particle that we now know is a [Higgs boson](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson). Scientists here are now [looking forward to physics research at unprecedented energies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMc6OCTxIEM&list=PLAk-9e5KQYEpm9HTFxBw44K9QAkbJTJ5X).

I'm a guy who's obsessed with music in a corner of the world that most people never even think about, Indonesia. Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world and also perhaps the most musically diverse country on the planet, but so much of this music is unknown or unavailable outside the country. My mission is to share this stuff with the world.

For more than four years I've been traveling around Indonesia researching and recording dozens of Indonesian music styles and sharing it all for free on my website, [Aural Archipelago.](http://www.auralarchipelago.com) Without a formal background in ethnomusicology, I've figured it all out as I go: becoming fluent in Indonesian, learning how to do fieldwork, and making connections with musicians and communities across the thousands of islands in the archipelago. I travel with all my gear in a backpack, staying with musicians in their homes, going to remote villages that have never seen foreigners, and finding music that's never been heard outside of these islands. There have been lots of adventures along the way and so, so much great music. 

A few notes to answer FAQ:

How do I make money?/Is this my job?: This isn't my job. For most of the time I've been doing this I was supporting myself and the project by teaching English full time. My description may have been a bit misleading, I travel often but it is not a constant thing. This is a passion project, but I don't make a living from this. I receive donations on my site occasionally, but these are forwarded to musicians. I now also do occasional work as a fixer and guide for others looking for music in Indonesia.

How did you get into this field?: To be clear, I have no academic background in ethnomusicology. I studied the traditional music called gamelan as an extracurricular in university, then decided to move to Indonesia to teach English and learn more about the gamelan that I'd fallen in love with. Since then everything I know about ethnomusicology I've figured out along the way. It's a fascinating field for anyone interested in music, but for those who want to make it their career (again, this is not my career, just a passion project!), it has the same pitfalls of any other job in academia. 

Do you pay the musicians?/Aren't you exploiting them?: Yes, I always pay musicians a reasonable fee for performances that I commission. I'm not releasing whole albums of their music for free, just a track or two to get people interested, something the musicians are very much on board with. The idea is that rather than put this music on albums that won't be affordable for everyone (especially Indonesians themselves), the music is available online for everyone, especially Indonesians and people from these communities who couldn't afford a proper album. 

Ask me anything :)

I hope those who are interested will go to the site and maybe fall in love with some of this music just as I have. If there's a particular group or artist that you like, you can leave a comment and I will relay it to the musicians, almost all of whom I'm still in touch with. Terima kasih! "

I was basically raised as a Jehovah's Witness. My wife and her whole family was one as well. I was a congregation elder, which means I held a position of authority in the congregation. I delivered public talks, conducted public Bible studies, spent some time as a secretary (JWs produce a TON of paperwork!), basically ran the whole circus locally. We had aspiration for me to become a circuit overseer, which is the guy who goes from city to city and makes sure all wishes of the Governing Body are implemented in the congregations. On top of that, both me and my wife served as ""regular pioneers"" for few years, which meant we had to spend ~70 hours preaching every month. This is voluntary, normally JWs don't have any required quota for how many hours they have to report. But they have to do it every month to keep being ""active"".

Two years ago together with my wife we began to wake up from the indoctrination, and then proceeded to help friends and family as well. Unfortunately our families didn't respond well to that. Jehovah's Witnesses call people who leave their faith and put it in negative light ""apostates"". They are prohibited from talking, and even from saying ""hello"" to them, or from reading their blogs, etc. So... our family now refuses to acknowledge us. We have lost them, possibly forever...

We've decided to use our knowledge to help others - to try making people who are still in to see that they are being lied to. I've set up [a website](https://wtsarchive.com) where I publish confidential files that normally are available only to certain people - letters from the HQ to elders, convention videos, old books that are out of print because the doctrine has changed and more. I'm also an admin of polish Ex-JW forums with 500+ members registered (and growing quickly, 48 registered in this month alone). Most recently I've shot a video for the general public which aims to show their practices in a easy to swallow manner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Hlb1b9SBA

And that's just about it. If that seems interesting to you, **feel free to ask ANYTHING**. I may only refuse to answer some personal details that could identify me, because I don't want to formally leave them just yet, as being inside helps me to help others. I will answer questions today for the next 5-6 hours, and if they are any left, then even tomorrow.

**Short summary about JWs**: Jehovah's Witnesses are an apocalyptic cult started 140 years ago by a guy named Charles Taze Russell. For all this time they have proclaimed that the end is coming soon™. They even set some exact years for this to happen: 1914, 1925, 1975 among others. Currently there are 8 million of them world-wide, over 1.2 million in the USA. While they may seem innocent, their practices hurt people in many different ways. They are hiding child abuse on a grand scale (in Australia alone a Royal Commission unearthed over 1800 cases of child abuse among JWs, none of which was reported to the authorities by them). They destroy families due to their shunning policy - when a member of your family is being disfellowshipped (for example because they slept with someone before getting married, were smoking, took blood in hospital or spoke against the organization). They prohibit blood transfusions which literally takes people's lives. Finally they mess up with your head, telling you that everyone in the outside world is wicked and deserves to die, while you can live forever given that you do exactly as they tell you to.

**My Proof:** [Here's a picture of me](http://imgur.com/uy0YgjC) holding a book that only elders are allowed to have - ""Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock"", and also an outline of a talk that was delivered on this year's conventions. If that's not enough, I can take photos of newest elders handbook, convention lapel badges or many other publications.

EDIT: More proof - [decades worth of elders-only correspondence](http://i.imgur.com/6RW7VWe.jpg).

UPDATE: Wow, this just exploded. Please bear with me as I try to keep up with all the questions!

UPDATE 2: Thanks for all the questions people, there were so many that unfortunately I couldn't answer them all, but my fellow Ex-JWs managed to answer a few. I will return here tomorrow and try to answer ones that were left unanswered. And even after the AMA ends I urge you to visit r/exjw, you will get even more answers there.

Read more about the case in [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/business/energy-environment/big-win-for-beekeepers-as-court-voids-insecticide.html?_r=1), the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bees-insecticide-20150910-story.html), and [Rolling Stone](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/what-is-killing-americas-bees-and-what-does-it-mean-for-us-20150818?page=3).

6tnrx9,Hello! My name is Jake. Nearly 3 years ago I found a band's demo on reddit & convinced them to let me release it on vinyl.

Luckily, the album took off and sold out pretty fast & now I've repeated that process about 20 times with bands from all over the USA (and one from the UK).

I lost my job in march right before South by South West and it really changed my life. I met my now friends Prince Daddy & The Hyena while at ""unofficial"" events at the festival & have toured the country with them numerous times now, including 1 day after meeting them. 

It is hard to make money from this and I will likely be scraping by for awhile, but currently I am running the company from my bedroom, doing all the mail order myself, & I get to sell their records firsthand at shows while seeing the country with some great friends.

I've seen my bands play to 3 people in a taco restaurant and play sold out shows opening for the likes of Silversun Pickups & Letters to Cleo at ridiculous venues I grew up going to like The Paradise in Boston. It's been a really cool few years. AMA!

Right now this thread is taking up way to much of my brainspace and my relationships with people today has suffered so I'm calling it quits for real.** 

**I wanted to make a couple of statments before I take my break.**

**First, there absolutely are reasons and legitimate studies out there that raise concern about 5G an human health (not Covid19 but other effects). None of those studies show conclusive evidence that there are negative effects but there is enough noise being made that I personally believe that governments should invest  a couple million dollars in high quality research to get good answers to these questions.**

**Also, some people have presented specific articles that I'm going to try to get back at. Maybe I'll respond to some of them in this post later on.**

**A lot of people asked how we should show how people believing in these conspiracies are stupid. I dont think we should. Especially if we ourselves have no expertise to build our believes on that 5G is harmless. It can very well be but if we don't know why we shouldnt ridicule others for worrying. We can however question people their believes and if their believes are unfounded, then that will present itself automatically.**

**I will not be responding to questions anymore. Thanks to all the people who have given gold or platinum. Lets please try to stay humble where we can. We don't want to divide humanity and push conspiracy theorists in a corner because that will just get them to ignore and doubt all of the common naratives, including the ones that advice on social distancing etc.**

&#x200B;

Now that partially due to London Real the claim that 5G is causing Covid19, its extremely important to protect ourselves with a healthy understanding of the world around us. Its easy to write these Conspiracy theories off as idiotic but its much more important to be able to counter false claims with factually correct counter arguments than ad-hominem.

Its true that I am not at all an expert on immunology or virology but I do a thing or two about telecommunication systems and I can imagine that some of you might have questions regarding these claims that are made in these videos.

I have a masters degree in Electrical Engineering where I specialized in Telecommunication Engineering (broadly speaking the study of how information can be transferred through the electromagnetic fields). I also have a qualification to teach physics at a high school level and have plenty of experience as a student assistant. I currently work at a company developing military radar systems where I work as an Antenna Engineer.

I settled in South Korea in 2001 and I majored in law at Korea University. My father gave me a dream. This was a difficult dream to bear while under the North Korean regime. He said, ""If you leave this wretched country of the Kims and go find your grandfather in the U.S., he'll at least educate you."" ""The dream of studying with blue-eyed friends"" was a thought that always made me happy. Enmeshed in this dream, I escaped North Korea all alone without a single relative. This was something my dad had said to my 15-year-old self after having a drink, but this seed of a ""dream"" became embedded deeply in my mind, and as the years went by, it grew so strongly that I couldn't help but bring it to action. I thought carefully about why I wanted this so desperately to risk my life. The words of my father that ""changed my consciousness"" was ""information about the outside world."" The genuine solution to the North Korean issue is the ""change of consciousness"" of the North Korean people. To resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear weapons, there may be different opinions between the Democrat and Republican parties, but despite the change in administration, ""information dissemination"" in North Korea is a movement that must continuously go on. When looking at issues of Muslim refugees or ISIS that show the appearances of clash of civilizations, the above can be said with even more conviction. In the end, even if a totalitarian regime is removed, if there is no ""change in consciousness"" of the people as a foundation, diplomatic approaches or military methods to remove a regime are not solutions for the root issue. The change that I experienced through the ""information dissemination"" that we do to send in USBs or SD cards to North Korea, thus the ""change of consciousness"" among the North Korean people, must be established first as a foundation. Please refer to the link below to find out more details about our ""information dissemination"" work. On Wednesday, December 7th from 10AM - 11AM KST (Tuesday, December 6th 8PM - 9PM EST), I'll be answering your questions. Thank you.

50axy9,Nearly 70% of America's kids read below grade level. I am Dr. Michael Colvard and I teamed up a producer from The Simpsons to build a game to help. AMA!,22239,0.78,2296,2016-08-30 18:20:21,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/50axy9/nearly_70_of_americas_kids_read_below_grade_level/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/50axy9/nearly_70_of_americas_kids_read_below_grade_level/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"**My short bio:** Hello, I am Dr. Michael Colvard, a practicing eye surgeon in Los Angeles. I was born in a small farming town in the South. Though my family didn't have much money, I was lucky enough to acquire strong reading skills which allowed me to do well in school and fulfill my goal of practicing medicine. 

I believe, as I'm sure we all do, that every child should be able to dream beyond their circumstances and, through education, rise to his or her highest level. A child's future should not be determined by the zip code they happen to be born into or who their parents are.

Unfortunately, this is not the case for many children in America today. The [National Assessment of Reading Progress study](http://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2015/#reading?grade=4) shows year after year that roughly 66% of 4th grade kids read at a level described as ""below proficiency."" This means that these children lack even the most basic reading skills. Further, data shows that kids who fail to read proficiently by the 4th grade almost never catch up.

I am not an educator, but I've seen time and again that many of the best ideas in medicine come from disciplines outside the industry. I approached the challenge of teaching reading through the lens of the neurobiology of how the brain processes language. To paraphrase (and sanitize) Matt Damon in ""The Martian"", my team and I decided to science the heck out of this.

**Why are we doing such a bad job of teaching reading?**
Our kids aren't learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong. Ironically, the most common method is also the least effective. It is called **""whole word""** reading. **""Whole word""** teaches kids to see an entire word as a single symbol and memorize it. At first, kids are able to memorize many words quickly. Unfortunately, the human brain can only retain about 2000 symbols which children hit around the 3rd grade. This is why many kids seem advanced in early grades but face major challenges as they progress.


**The Phoneme Farm method**
I teamed up with top early reading specialists, animators, song writers and programmers to build Phoneme Farm. In Phoneme Farm **we start with sounds first**. We teach kids to recognize the individual sounds of language called phonemes (there are 40 in English). Then we teach them to associate these sounds with letters and words. This approach is far more easily understood and effective for kids. It is in use at 40 schools today and growing fast. You can download it free [here for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) or [here for iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/professor-pup-s-phoneme-farm/id1085432161?mt=8) to try it for yourself.

**Why I'm here today**
I am here to help frustrated parents understand why their kids may be struggling with reading, and what they can do about it. I can answer questions about the biology of reading, the history of language, how written language is simply a code for spoken language, and how this understanding informs the way we must teach children to read.

Ok, reddit,  ask me anything.

**Update:** It's very flattering to me that anybody wants to communicate, or cares about my position on things. And I guess the only thing I would like to share is that we can all make a difference. We have to look outside of ourselves, come from a place of service, and we can all ameliorate the human condition. Each in his own way.
And giving is far more valuable than receiving. To be able to make a difference in somebody less fortunate's life is the greatest gift of all. 

So I do want to thank reddit, and all of the people who have been kind enough to care about what I have to say, and who have been fans, I *really* appreciate it. Keep drinking responsibly, and stay thirsty for *all* things.

fuv88f,"I am a Japanese dude having been a shut-in(aka Hikikomori) for 10 years, currently developing a Hikikomori-themed video game alone for 2.5 years. I think keeping hope has helped me stay on track during a difficult time. AMA!

I was born and raised in Japan. After graduating from uni in Tokyo, I couldn't land a good job. I was passionate about creative writing since I was a teenager, had believed I would become a novelist. So I was writing novels while hopping several jobs. I finished a new novel which I poured my best effort into, sent it to my friends, my brain and body were tired but filled with a sense of accomplishment. Several months had passed. I had gradually realized and accepted that my novels were lacking commercial prospects.

I came back to my home town, losing hope to become a novelist but having another plan: To practice manga/anime art and become a ""doujin"" creator.

Doujin means indie/independent. There are lots of indie creators in Japan, mainly manga artists and a relatively small amount of game creators, they live off their creation via digital stores or physical distribution. I simply wanted to give a shape to my imagination and the doujin industry seemed a great place for that. I started learning how to draw in my old room. I had no friends in my home town and felt rushed to become financially independent as soon as possible, feeling ashamed to go outside. So I became a hikikomori. That was 10 years ago.

I wasn't good at drawing at all, rather having a complex about drawing. So I often faced a hard time practicing my art.

Eventually I made a couple of doujin works, sold them on digital stores and earn a little amount of money. But my complex had become bigger and started crippling my mind. I realized I need to seek another field to make a living. That was 5 years ago.

At that moment, I had noticed that Steam and indie games had become a big thing in the West. Video game is a great medium for telling a story, which is very appealing to me. The problem was, however, my English was not great and I couldn't write my game scenario in English. But I was desperate enough to start learning about the game development anyway. I thought this challenge would be the last chance for me.

Now already 5 years have passed. After failing several projects, I have finally stuck to the current project [Pull Stay](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1179890/Pull_Stay/), which is a literal translation of hikikomori.

Looking back on the last 10 years, I made a lot of mistakes and bad choices. Probably I shouldn't start to practice drawing in the first place. But this skill now helps me make 2D and 3D assets for games. I don't know... Honestly, I'm sometimes feeling so sad about wasting such a long time and still not being able to stand on my own feet.

But I do know I just need to hang in there. I'm planning to complete my game in a year, hoping it will pull me out from this hikikomori mud. Also my English has improved a little bit thanks to the game development because learning materials are basically written/spoken in English. That is an unexpected bonus.

And I'm telling you. I haven't entirely ditched yet my hope of writing novels one day. I'm not 100% sure whether what I'm seeing is a hope or just a delusion, but I can say this is what has kept me sane for the last 10 years.

So yeah, please ask me anything. Maybe I will need a bit long time to write the reply, but I will try my best (´▽｀)

My father was drafted into the Romanian Army (then allied with Nazi Germany) in 1942, eventually coming home after the Battle of Stalingrad, only to be drafted again in 1944 but this time by the Red Army after the Russians took the Romanian region of Basarabia. 

We were now part of the Soviet Union. I grew up in a house with my Mother and Grandparents. I had a total of 7 brothers and sisters, [3 of whom eventually succumbed to hunger and diseases](http://i.imgur.com/Y36pTR8.jpg) around 1946, when the Soviets started taking all our food to send back to Russia. My Grandpa also died of hunger when he refused to give up his horse. Back then we relied on roots and small rations of soups as everything was for the collective.

In 1956 I finished 7th grade in the local school. I wanted to study, but everything was far away, we had no roads and no chance to reach any other schools so I started learning how to sew from my neighbor in her improvised shop. This unfortunately didn't help our condition as I couldn't earn any money with my skills. 

Once Stalin died, a lot of deported men and women where allowed to go back to their homes, and in 1962 I met one of those men, who wanted us to marry. [We did](http://i.imgur.com/IUjsPAP.jpg), but I set a condition: I would only become his wife if I we moved to his village, Cuza-Voda, since they had a high-school and I could study 3 more years. 

Having finished high-school, I moved to the capital city of Moldova, Chisinau, to become a pharmacist while my husband studied in the Music Collegium. We eventually moved back Cuza-Voda, [had a daughter](http://i.imgur.com/4psvcLj.jpg) and lived through the Soviet Union, after which our country became the independent Republic of Moldova in 1991. It is indeed weird to see all these countries named in such a small region; now imagine having 3 different identities throughout your life: Romanian, Soviet and Moldovan. 

My family was always very patriotic and I'm a big History and Geography fan. It'd be my pleasure to answer any questions you might have.

More About Me: I am Ben Lesser and I am the founder of the [**Zachor Holocaust Remembrance Foundation**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/)**.**

I was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1928. With the exception of my older sister Lola and myself, the rest of my family was killed by the Nazis.

Over the 5 years of the war, I was fortunate to survive several ghettos, as well as the notorious camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and finally be liberated in Dachau. After the war, in 1947 I immigrated to the United States where a few years later, in 1950, I met and married my wife Jean.

Over the years, I became a successful realtor in Los Angeles and after retiring in 1995, I have devoted my time to being a volunteer to speak in colleges and schools about the Holocaust.

I wrote a book about my experiences, entitled **Living a Life that Matters** **(**[**paperback**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/product/living-life-matters-paperback/)**,** [**ebook**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/product/living-life-matters-ebook/)**)**.

szksev,I will soon become the tenth person (and my dog will become the first dog) to walk around the world. Ask me anything!,22071,0.87,1432,2022-02-23 21:29:17,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/szksev/i_will_soon_become_the_tenth_person_and_my_dog/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/szksev/i_will_soon_become_the_tenth_person_and_my_dog/,self.IAmA,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"As the title states, in about three months, I will become the tenth person to have walked around the world and my dog will become the first dog to have done so.

Seven years ago I left my home in New Jersey to embark on a twenty-five thousand mile, seven continent, walk around the world (which didn’t go entirely to plan due to covid). After four months of walking, I adopted a dog, [Savannah](https://www.instagram.com/p/CREGmyQLXcI/), and together we've covered 22,500 miles across thirty-five countries.

When Savannah was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart. Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running circles at night. We’ve spent nearly every minute of every day together. From navigating chaotic cities and strange new environments, Sav and I are totally in sync. She’s my best bud and absolutely rock solid. (The Dodo did [a video on her](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NdSwnAVtK/).)

I'm walking around the world because of a friend who died at seventeen. Her death led me to understand how fleeting my life is and impressed on me the need to make the most of the short time I have. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around the world stuck in my head as a way to live a full life.

From seventeen to twenty-six I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility.

During the first two years of this adventure, I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knifepoint in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. They were incredibly clarifying years. The endless hours of walking allowed me to reach a profound acceptance of my life, my choices, and my idiosyncrasies.

During the three years after walking The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&theater) by a bacterial infection, needed seven months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey, and into Azerbaijan. I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four-hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia, and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot (the Istanbul bridge which crosses from Europe to Asia). These years nurtured in me an appreciation for how history, geography, and circumstance affect everything from culture to the economy in different countries. People are the same everywhere. It's the greater and often uncontrollable forces that affect their and their country’s fate.

Since getting caught in a covid lockdown in Azerbaijan two years ago, the walking has become immensely more challenging. My planned route from Kazakhstan to Mongolia, then walking the coast of Australia, became impossible due to border closures. I made due by walking more of Turkey while waiting for the world to reopen, then walking Uzbekistan and the [mountains of Kyrgyzstan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CRJvzx1rlT7/). But by the time I finished walking Kyrgyzstan, much of the world remained closed, so Savannah and I flew to Seattle and began the last leg of our journey; a three thousand mile walk back home to New Jersey. Strangely enough, this walk across my home country has proved the most difficult section of the journey. With the end in sight, I feel like it's taking every ounce of effort I have just to finish this thing. 

When this is all over I plan to write a memoir and a children's book, but The World Walk has been my life for so long that I'm certain my transition back to normal life won't be easy.

Currently, Sav and I are posted up in Kansas waiting out a winter storm so I thought this would be the perfect moment for an AMA.

This [infographic](https://www.theworldwalk.com/infographic/) on my site provides a great visualization of most of our walk. And [this video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=311540596150551) from Sunrise Australia provides the best summation of our journey. Also, there's [this great article](https://www.afar.com/magazine/tom-turcich-and-the-world-walk) AFAR wrote on me and Savannah. If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos, film short videos, and write the occasional blog post.

This therapy helps people to process difficult and traumatic emotions and experiences, break destructive patterns of thought and behavior, and to love, integrate and forgive themselves and each other.

I posted them the same night I got home from hiking the Appalachian Trail, a 2000 mile footpath from Georgia to Maine. The journey took me 153 days and changed my life. Before I did that I was a consultant for a software company. When I tried to go back, it didn't work. 

For five months my alarm clock was birds. I felt the sun, wind and rain on my face every day. Switching back to right angles and deadlines gave me genuine panic attacks.

I spent the following 11 months exhausting my savings and racking up debt so I could go back into the woods and work it out on paper. I took a small tablet and bluetooth keyboard into the forest closest to home and lived by waterfalls and streams again, this time putting it down in a way that makes sense, not just to hikers.  

But... What I also wanted to do, was *entertain*. Too many hiking books are written diary style. *Day 42: 18 miles. Oatmeal again.* No one wants to read that. 

***[Where's the Next Shelter?](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/)*** is what I brought back from the woods. It's nonfiction but reads like a novel. I've been told it's funny which is good because I meant it to be.  Imagine how I'd feel otherwise. It's thought provoking, full of surprises, and most importantly, for the rest of August 6th, **[it's FREE](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/)**. (Obviously, this is an old post; I still make my books free from time to time, so keep an eye on 'em!)

By some miracle, enough people who weren't my mom liked it and now I get to hike and write full time. I live in the woods (literally, my house is in a forest now) and I get to work with the trail and all the wonderful people who surround it. 

I teach for REI, moderate /r/AppalachianTrail, sit on the board of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association, I've recorded an[ audio book](http://www.wheresthenextshelter.com/), and have recently been [telling stories for NPR's The Moth](https://youtu.be/VPw3qPS0HyQ). 

This is the happiest and busiest I've been since quitting my office job! One might even say I'm obsessed with the outdoors. If you're wondering how someone goes from being *kinda* normal to throwing it all away to go live outside, you're in luck. That's what my current book is about. 

***[Home is Forward](https://www.garysizer.com)*** tells the story of my comedic descent into madness. It starts in boot camp, the first time I ever slept in a tent and takes us through jungles, over tundra and on top of glaciers. It's even a bit of a love story, too. Gross. 

So thanks for looking. I've got tons of stories and plenty of opinions, and I'm ready to go. Whatcha got?

What's up ladies and gents. I'm Stefan and I have been teaching people to control their dreams using 'lucid dreaming' for about a year or so. 

I founded the website http://howtolucid.com (It's down right now because there's too much traffic going to it, check back in a day or two) and wrote a handful of books on the subject. Lucid dreaming is the ability to become 'aware' of the fact that you're dreaming WHILE you're in the dream. This means you can control it.

You can control anything in the dream.. What you do, where you go, how it feels etc...You can use it to remove fears from your mind, stop having nightmares, reconnect with lost relatives or friends, and much more. 

For proof that I'm actually Stefan, here's a Tweet sent from the HowToLucid company Twitter - https://twitter.com/howtolucid/status/768052997947592704

Also another proof, here is my author page (books I've written about lucid dreaming) - https://www.amazon.com/Stefan-Z/e/B01KACOB20/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1471961461&sr=8-1

I lived as a child in Cuba for 7 years-we left when the revolution began. Our plane left Havana and the next plane was shot down. I then moved back to the states and ended up going to LSU, graduated medical school in 1950. My residency was at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. My first job was Crown Point in New Mexico, working with the Navahos for 9 months.

After that I went to Alaska, and I was supposed to work in Anchorage, but the Native Alaskan Hospital was not finished. So I went to Tanana, in the middle of Alaska, and ran the hospital as the only doctor. I had 18 villages, none connected by roads and so I had to go by float plane and dogsled. I was a dentist, surgeon, OB, psychiatrist (whatever was needed)... holding clinics every 5-6 weeks and seeing everybody in the village. 

I have delivered a baby in a plane, gone on rescue trips up the frozen Yukon on dogsled, had many babies named after me, and many more adventures!

**About the World Wide Web** | [Watch “A brief history of the Web”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSqZ_hJu9zA)

> Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
> 
> The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer.
> 
> On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Later, CERN made a release available with an open licence, a more sure way to maximise its dissemination. These actions allowed the Web to flourish.

YouTube is the most watched video platform in human history. Its algorithm-driven recommendation system played a role in driving some Brazilians toward far-right candidates and electing their new president, Jair Bolsonaro. Since taking office in January, he and his followers govern Brazil via YouTube, using the trolling and provocative tactics they honed during their campaigns to mobilize users in a kind of never-ending us-vs-them campaign.

[We reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/americas/youtube-pedophiles.html) in June that YouTube’s automated recommendation system had linked together a vast video catalog of prepubescent, partly clothed children, directing hundreds of thousands of views to what a team of researchers called one of the largest child sexual exploitation networks they’d seen.

When I was younger, say around 15-16 I went to the doctor about my enlarged left ball. He said I had vericose veins, which he basically described as the veins you see on the back of olds people's calves; but in my ball. So I took that news and ran with it for the next 15 years!

Anytime my ball was big or would hurt, I would just blame the golden girls for the veiny enlarged ball. Recently my left nut has started to hurt something fierce. It's much tender to the touch, it's got a lot bigger and the testicle feels like a rock. The right feels like that squishy easter candy no one likes but the left feels hard puddy that's starting to dry out.

Well I finally skipped the family doctor and went to a urologist. The guy told me to drop trou and inspected my deformed family jewels. He told me it wasn't vericose veins and I needed a sonogram ASAP.

Well I went and got my sonogram, pictures below. Went back, doctor looked at them and said he wanted additional tests. Apparently testi cancer can spread to your lungs. So got CT scan on nether region, X-Ray on chest and blood test to test for cancer markers. Well yesterday I went in for the results. Chest is clear! Whew. It's contained in my left nut! Whew. However old lefty does indeed have the cancer and is going to leave me in a week.

I hope this posts inspires at least one guy to go to a urologist and get his large ball checked out that he thought was just veins for the last 15 years.

TLDR; thought left nut had veins, turns out it was cancer

Thanks for having me. I am Don Vultaggio, Founder & Chairman of AriZona Beverage Company. I look forward to hearing from you all, today.

Here is a little bit about how I ended up here:

I broke into the beverage industry in the early 70's as a local beer distributor. I went on to build a beer business, Hornell Brewing Co. We were very successful but I wanted to offer something to a wider audience...

In 1992 I had the idea to start selling iced teas bigger and better than anyone out there… literally! We packaged our tea in a never-done-before Big Can and started with AriZona Lemon and Raspberry Iced Tea. We then went on to create Green Tea and Arnold Palmer, among many other AriZona products you know and love. It was very exciting to see the fans love and support, in such a big way. 

In 1998, we introduced the the 99-cent suggested price point to the packaging label. We still pre price them 99¢ to this day. My goal was to bring quality and quantity to the masses for an affordable price and the rest is history!

We produced our first AriZona Tea on May 5th in 1992 and today we are celebrating our 28th anniversary! Thanks to our employees, loyal fans, and retailers we now sell AriZona worldwide in over 50 countries.


Despite our global growth, we remain family-owned and operated and plan to keep it that way. My son Spencer is helping me write these responses. So, don't be shy, ask me (us) anything about our history, favorite AriZona beverages, about building a business or more.

I’ve been doing AMA’s for these “off the street” hiring announcements since 2018. Since they always gain a lot of interest, I’m back for another one. I’ve heard back from *hundreds* of people over the past few years who saw my posts, applied, and are now air traffic controllers. Hopefully this post can reach someone else who might be looking for a really cool job. 

Check out my previous AMAs for *tons* of info:

The application window will open from **June 24 - June 27** for all eligible U.S. citizens. Eligibility requirements are as follows:

- Must be a U.S. citizen

- Must be registered for Selective Service, if applicable (Required for males born after 12/31/1959) 

- Must be age 30 or under on the closing date of the application period (with limited exceptions)

- Must have either three years of general work experience or four years of education leading to a bachelor’s degree, or a combination of both

- Must speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment

[MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS](https://www.aviationmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Medical-Standards-for-Terminal-and-En-Route-Centers-for-ATC-Positions%C2%A0FAA-Brochure.pdf)

I *highly* recommend checking out the FAA’s info on their site [HERE](https://www.faa.gov/be-atc?fbclid=IwAR2h7rvrLZIJxZhoovcCB_ZetnlXRlQaTXnB7aBLd-wEdg4SW4xLG5uFReU&fs=e&s=cl#Be%20Ready). It includes instructions on *how to apply*.

Let’s start with the difficult stuff: 

The hiring process is *incredibly* arduous. After applying, you will have to wait for the FAA to process all applications, determine eligibility, and then reach out to you to schedule the AT-SA. This is basically an air traffic aptitude test. The testing window usually lasts weeks-months for everyone to get tested. Your score will place you into one of several “bands”, the top of which being “Best Qualified.” In previous bids, essentially only those in the Best Qualified band get an offer letter. 

If you receive and accept an offer letter (called a Tentative Offer Letter, or TOL) you will then have to pass medical, background, and psychological evaluations. If you do, you will receive a final offer letter (FOL) and be scheduled to attend the FAA Academy in OKC (paid).

Depending on which track you are assigned (Terminal or En Route), you will be at the academy for 3-4 months. You will have to pass your evaluations at the end in order to continue on to your facility. **There is a 99% chance you will have to relocate.** Your class will get a list of available facilities to choose from based solely on national staffing needs. If you fail your evaluations, your position will be terminated. Once at your facility, on the job training typically lasts anywhere from 1-3 years. You will receive raises as you progress through training. 

**All that being said:**

This is an *incredibly* rewarding career. The median pay for air traffic controllers in 2021 was **$138,556**. We receive extremely competitive benefits and leave, and won’t work a day past 56 (mandatory retirement, **with a pension**). We also get **3 months of paid parental leave**. Most controllers would tell you they can’t imagine doing anything else. Speaking for myself, when I’m not on position working traffic I’m either playing Xbox, spikeball, volleyball, resting, etc. Enjoying yourself at work is actively encouraged, as taking down time in between working traffic is paramount for safety. Some controllers will read this and scoff, and rightfully so as not all facilities are well-staffed and working conditions can vary greatly. But overall, it’s hard to find a controller who wouldn’t tell you this is the best job in the world. 

Please ask away in the comments and/or my DMs. I always respond to everyone eventually. Good luck!"

I'm sitting here with my 95 year old german grandmother. [Proof](http://imgur.com/0kKY9tj).

Some pictures of her: http://imgur.com/a/QIHlo

She is a very active women but had a stroke a few months ago. Now she has difficulties to walk and use her right hand (and she loved to write).
Before her story gets lost I thought I document it and an AMA seems like a great way to give young people like me the opprtunity to ask questions.
Her experience is very valuable to me, and it would be sad if it just would get lost.

She was born in May 1920, is now 95 years old and lived all her life in a village in the beautiful Black Forest.
She went to board school from 6-14y/o and went to a college of housecraft afterwards, where she took afternoon lessons in office work. She learned shorthand and to write with a typewriter. She got her first job with 17 in a law and collection office. At this time she was also active in the [Bund deutscher Mädchen (BDM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_German_Girls) and in a girl church group. Leaders from the BDM didn't support her role in the church group and wanted that she stops going there, but she refused and was
called ""stubborn"".

From 1939 to 1945 she worked at a company where the wife of the owner and her brother were half jews. But they were the only jews in the village and they didn't get imprisoned, because their company was important for the war. They manufactured fabrics for uniforms. In 1944 she got engaged with her first partner. But he had to go into the war. He was missing for 7 years, until she got notice that he died in the war at christmas eve, when Englishman attacked on the 24th december. Her father was also in the war in 1942 as a medic. He then got captured by Russian soldiers and was in war imprisonment for 3 1/2 years. When he came back he was wearing rags and was extremely underweight from starvation and work.

Her village was occupied by the French, or to be more exact Moroccans. They were not allowed to leave the house, but she did it anyway and almost got shot.

In 1955 she got engaged to my grandfather. His first wife died during the war in Düsseldorf because of bombing. When he was in the war, he was in russian war imprisonment and was later transfered to a French prison. He died in 2000 in a car accident.

If you are looking about a topic to ask, she is very proud of the jobs. She always worked and was not a stay-at-home mom.

**07:25:50 EDT | 13:25:50 CEST:** we just had lunch. We are now waiting for questions. She skips her after-lunch nap for you all.

**09:15:07 EDT | 15:15:07 CEST:** My oma has a great time. She wants to answer every question. We will make a short coffee break. We will be back in a few minutes.

**10:39:23 EDT | 16:39:23 CEST:** My grandmother can't comprehend how 3800 people like to hear about it. And that there are over 1000 comments.

**13:01:13 EDT | 19:01:13 CEST:** We are eating dinner really quick. We will be right back. Gosh... an AMA is really a lot of work!


**15:00:05 EDT | 21:00:05 CEST:** We decided to answer some `new` comments. But she is very tired now. After over 7 hours without her nap, she is very exhausted. We will answer some more questions tomorrow. Please upvote some unanswered questions :)

**07:15:31 EDT | 13:15:31 CEST:** We will answer some more questions now

**08:32:03 EDT | 14:32:03 CEST:** Now we have to drink coffee with relatives. We celebrate easter a little bit here. We will probably come back to a few questions later tonight.

Thank you very much for participating. She was very happy today.

Please be respectful.

If you like the Muppets - it's a movie for anybody. It does have a few words that puts it into not suitable for children, but I don't think it would hurt any children. It's for children old enough to know that Big Bird isn't a real bird, just me.

But everybody has loved the movie. The music is particularly beautiful in the movie. And I urge you to see it, if you like what we do. It's really quite a love story in there, about somebody I love very much.

Thank you!"

2dlqut,IamA guy who was falsely accused of molesting my stepdaughter by my ex wife after I asked for a divorce. I was arrested and convicted of a sex crime and sentenced to 15 years in prison. After 17 months of incarceration I was able to prove my innocence and out of prison. AMA!,20186,0.88,4246,2014-08-15 08:56:58,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dlqut/iama_guy_who_was_falsely_accused_of_molesting_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dlqut/iama_guy_who_was_falsely_accused_of_molesting_my/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Not too long ago in a state not too far away, but mostly forgotten, I was arrested, tried, and convicted of child molestation.  The charges were false, the proof nonexistent, but that didn't seem to matter to the Assistant DAs that were assigned to my case. 

The story starts a few years back:
It's very long and if it didn't happen to me, almost unbelievable story of lies, theft, overzealous county workers, and betrayal.  I swear it would make a great ""Lifetime"" movie...   

All of my troubles started after I found out my (now ex) wife was having ANOTHER affair and stealing money from my bank and credit accounts.  I confronted her and after a lot of argument I told her that I wanted a divorce and custody of my son.  The next day She starts laughing and saying that my stepdaughter said I had abused her (which was a lie) and that she would be calling the police.  
Because MS would have allowed me to sue for denial of affection, and that I had a very good case in which I could not only keep most of my assets (most of which I had long before I married the woman) but also likely get custody of my son and make her pay me child support, she played the trump card that so many do now a days.  She called the police and said I did things to my step daughter that I didn't do and got her to relay some of the information to the police as well (however almost none of it matched nor was it consistent, but the ADA didn't care)

Yeah, so my saga started off with my first attorney.  He seemed like a decent lawyer and all, but right after I gave him my last payment he tells me that he took a Federal Public defenders position and had to recuse himself from my case.  Yay!  However, he tells me not to worry because he hired a ""really good"" attorney (second attorney or Attorney #2) who had tried cases like mine many times and will do really well with my ""open and shut case"".  

Long story short, attorney #2 tells me not to worry and that he's going to hire experts to refute the claims made by my stepdaughter and my ex-wife and have several of my long term friends testify for me and against my ex in court.  I give #2 copious amounts of financial and phone records to show that my ex was cheating and having multiple affairs, I also give him copious amounts of text messages where my ex was sending me pictures of my stepdaughter (unsolicited BTW) and conversations showing that she obviously knows the allegations are false.  

Fast forward to the trial and the first day Attorney #2 tells the court that our expert is going to show up the next day and that I have several witnesses to testify on my behalf.  The prosecutor objects because she apparently never received warning that we would have an expert (she knew I had experts and witnesses because Attorney #2 told her in front of me well before the trial, but Attorney #2 never put it in writing).  Regardless the Judge says we can discuss the expert situation when they go over the guys experience before allowing him to testify as an expert. After the trial starts Attorney #2 essentially quits leaving the guy who was supposed to just ""help"" as second chair to try the case.  The only problem is that I never talked to this guy about the case and he was flying blind.  When we tried to enter my evidence the prosecutor objects because Attorney #2 never turned in any of my information during discovery.  So, in essence this guy never did any of his pre-trial work and we had no proof to back up any of my claims.  When the prosecution rests I know I'm in trouble because we couldn't refute any of the lies they were saying because I had no proof or evidence.  The next day when the defense is supposed to take the stand I find out that my expert never showed up, even though I had paid Attorney #2  for him, and that there wasn't going to be anyone other than myself to testify on my behalf.  FUN!

With no evidence on my side it was all a “he said she said” situation.  The prosecutor did well in making me out to be a bad guy because I made good money but wouldn't go see my son (even though she was the one who put a no contact order on me for most of the pretrial time) and that my ex wouldn't agree to the visitation since she had moved out of the state after the start of the whole mess.  She also made it out to sound like I never gave my ex money for support, which was a lie as I was giving her over $1200 a month and paying most of her bills to support her and my son, but I couldn't prove it because none of my financial records were allow in as evidence.  Anyhow, long story short, with no evidence, no witnesses, and no expert of my side it only took the Jury 4 hours to deliberate and find me guilty.  

After the trial I found out that Attorney #2 had never paid my ""expert"" and that was why the guy never showed up. So not only did he lie to me but also lied to the court saying that I had an expert, which he knew I didn't since he took my money but never paid the guy.

Once I found this out I immediately fired Attorney #2 and found two good attorneys who I nicknamed “The Wonder Twins”.  I had to essentially sell everything I owned and borrowed money from friends and family to pay ""The Wonder Twins"".  With their help we were able to place a motion for retrial.  This motion normally happens within a few weeks after trial but because the prosecutor knew that we had enough evidence to say my first trial wasn't fair after we had a 6 month continuance on our side they delayed the hearing for another year.  So, after 1.5 years I got back into court and was able to start proving  that Attorney #2 was infective.  However, we never finished the whole brief.  One reason was that even if the Judge were to grant me a new trial I would have to stay locked up for another year at minimum waiting for my new trial to start.  The prosecution wasn't about to admit that my ex wife fooled them so they kept offering me plea deals to stop everything from moving forward.  I denied them until they came to one that dropped the nasty sex charge and let me out immediately.  In essence I took a plea for a lesser charge with time served and they let me out.  So, yeah, I am a convicted felon now, but I don't have to register or do probation like I would have with the other charge and I get to avoid another trial.  (The felony is going to make finding a job a lot harder but again, I got to come home and get out of prison).  
I did find it very ironic that I had to lie under oath and say I committed a crime that I didn't do to keep the prosecution from pressing charges on another crime I didn't do.  
Next week I am pressing felony embezzlement charges on Attorney #2 and plan to push it through.  I have plenty of proof to show he lied to me and to the court about my expert along with many other things.  I also plan to do several bar complaints again him and I'm going to try the same with the ADA since she knowing lied during my trial and pressed the case forward after receiving proof that it was not true.  I seriously doubt my complaints about the ADAs will go anywhere.  I'm also going to start the long process of trying to get custody of my son (if he even turns out to be mine after a DNA test), which I haven't seen since he was 6 months old.

So, that's the very short version of everything.  I am leaving A LOT of stuff out since it's too much to put into this AMA.


TL;DR: My ex lied to the police to keep from losing custody and all the assets she had stolen from me in a divorce.  I got shammed by a crooked attorney who stole my money and didn't even do cross during my trial and ""forgot"" to submit any of my evidence.  I hire new lawyers, take it all back to court and I win to some extent.  Instead of spending 15 years mandatory time I got out in 17 months. I’m and ex-con but at least I don’t have to register as a sex offender.

Ok gang, I don't think I have to say it but I want to make it clear.  I have no desire to cause harm to my ex or her family.  If you figure out who I am or who my ex are please, please, don't do anything stupid.

Ive been going at this for quite some time now and stayed up all night.  I'm hardly able to keep my eyes open so I am heading to bed.  I will try to respond more tomorrow.


Update #8

I deleted the account.  Please see update #10
Ok, after a lot of people asking I set up a Gofundme account to receive donations for my legal fees associated with my legal defense, to help prosecute the corrupt attorney who stole my money, and to seek custody of my son and possibly sue my ex wife.  Any left over money will be donated to charities who aid victims of child abuse.



Update #9
The vast majority of the people I have met in Mississippi are good honest people who get a fairly bad wrap in the media when it comes to their state.  I should not have tried to bash the whole state in my comments as I do have many friends here and it's a lovely place to live.  If it wasn't for my experience with the legal system I would be very happy here.  I apologize to all Mississippi residents, current, former or future for my harsh words and generalization of your state.  Please forgive me.  

Update #10

OK gang, I deleted my Gofundme account.  Anyone who donated should receive their money back.  Please contact Gofundme if you have not.

I didn't make the post for money.  I wrote the post because I hoped telling my side of the story would be therapeutic.  It's been fun and very frustrating at the same time, however once money was involved things moved to a whole new level.  Even though I could certainly use the extra cash I would much rather not deal with the BS surrounding it.
For those of you who did pledge money, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your compassion.  

Update #11
Some clarification.  I stated earlier that I could have sued my ex for ""denial of affection"", that was incorrect.  It's call ""Alienation of Affection"".

I've  been a game developer for over 10 years now. I got my first gig in  California as a character rigger working in online games. The first game  I worked on was never announced - it was canceled and I lost my job  along with \~100 other people. Thankfully I managed to get work right  after that on a title that shipped: Marvel Heroes Online.

Next  I moved to Boston to work as a sr tech animator on BioShock Infinite. I  had a blast working on this game and the DLCs. I really loved it there!  Unfortunately the studio was closed after we finished the DLC and I  lost my job. My previous studio (The Marvel Heroes Online team) was also  going through a rough patch and would eventually close.

So  I quit AAA for a bit. I got together with a few other devs that were  laid off and we founded a studio to make an indie game called ""The Flame  in The Flood."" It took us about 2 years to complete that game. It  didn't do well at first. We ran out of money and had to do contract work  as a studio... and that is when I sort of hit a low point. I had a  rough time getting excited about anything. I wasn’t happy, I considered  leaving the industry but I didn't know what else I would do with my  life... it was kind of bleak.

About  2 years ago I started working on a small indie game alone at home. It  was a passion project, and it was the first thing I'd worked on in a  long time that brought me joy. I became obsessed with it. Over the  course of a year I slowly cut ties with my first indie studio and I  focused full time on developing my indie puzzle game. I thought of it as  my last hurrah before I went out and got a real job somewhere. Last  year when Epic Games announced they were opening a store I contacted  them to show them what I was working on. I asked if they would include  Kine on their storefront and they said yes! They even took it further  and said they would fund the game if I signed on with their store  exclusively. The Epic Store hadn’t really launched yet and I had no idea  how controversial that would be, so I didn’t even think twice. With  money I could make a much bigger game. I could port Kine to consoles,  translate it into other languages… This was huge! I said yes.

Later  today I'm going to launch Kine. It is going to be on every console (PS4, Switch, Xbox) and  on the Epic Store. It is hard to explain how surreal this feels. I've  launched games before, but nothing like this. Kine truly feels 100%  mine. I'm having a hard time finding the words to explain what this is  like.

Some people play football. Some people play golf. We like to solve mysteries. This is Tomi Tuominen, Practice Leader at F-Secure Cyber Security Service, and Timo Hirvonen, Senior Security Consultant at F-Secure. About a decade ago we were at an infosec conference in Berlin. We learned that a laptop of a fellow researcher was stolen from a locked hotel room while they were out. There were no signs of forced entry, not a single indication of unauthorized room access -- nothing physical and nothing in the software logs. The hotel staff simply refused to believe it happened. But we never forgot. We figured that it might be possible to exploit the software system and create a master key basically out of thin air. It took a decade of countless hours of our own time but last month we finally revealed our research, after working with the manufacturer to fix the vulnerability.  
 
Now, for the first time, we're here to answer all the questions we can without violating ethical agreements with manufacturers and customers about our day jobs hacking businesses for a living and our hobby of hacking hotels.

My last AMA on /r/entrepreneur got pretty popular, so I figured I'd do one here too!

I'm Shay Skobeleva, 25 years old, and I work as a private tutor for the children of the lawyers, doctors, and executives of NYC. 

I went to university for genetics, but became disillusioned with the field after going to medical school. I decided to leave medical school and start a private tutoring company, and I couldn't be happier! I get to work with kids of all ages, and use science experiments to teach them more interesting math and science concepts than they're getting in school. 

I also teach pretty much every other subject, and do test prep. Surprisingly, there's a huge demand in the fall for prep for the Gifted and Talented Kindergarten Entry exam here in NYC. That boils down to **training 4-year olds to take an 80 question test!** 

I usually work between 10-15 hours/week, and spend my spare writing books, doing art projects, and inventing things.


My latest e-book is a [sarcastic textbook on personal hygiene](https://www.amazon.com/Hygiene-Practice-Principle-Shay-Skobeleva-ebook/dp/B06ZZNN2W8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1494023457&sr=8-1&keywords=hygiene:+practice+and+principle&linkCode=ll1&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=ca9cfc0f0b50780f88cf1c39f235d9c6) that I wrote after having some exceptionally smelly hall-mates in college. It makes a great gag gift for siblings.

EDIT: Over 1,000 downloads! Thanks guys, and I hope you guys enjoy it! 

I also wrote a more serious premed guide, which you can see [here](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Into-Medical-School-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B00K87UJVU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1494023495&sr=8-7&keywords=getting+into+medical+school&linkCode=ll1&tag=altiora20-20&linkId=d78b78a87a2ce74595827eec2366929d).

Invention wise, I recently used my experience working on mosquito research at Caltech to invent this low-cost, DIY, [Portable Mosquito Netting design](http://www.zikashield.net) to try and help stop the spread of Zika Virus. 


**EDIT:** A lot of people are asking about how I feel about the disparity between the ability of my clients to afford this prep and the ability of the less wealthy. This is something that I actively aim to combat, by releasing free test prep resources on my website. This past year, I wrote a free 50-question practice test for the Gifted and Talented Exam, which is unheard of in the industry. Additionally, I wrote downloadable practice tests for around 1/3 of the cost of the competition, as well as a free book on how to effectively study with your kids at home. Those are available [here](http://www.altiora.NYC/publications). I'm actively writing more materials and producing videos to give away for free or low cost, more will come out in the next months!

So, Ask Me Anything!

Most Americans, if they pay attention to politics at all, only pay attention to the Presidential election. **I think that’s a huge mistake** because we voters have far more influence over our representation in Congress, as the Presidential candidates are largely chosen by political party insiders.

**My passion drives me** to inform Americans about what happens in Congress after the elections and prepare them for the effects legislation will have on their lives. I also want to inspire more Americans to vote and run for office.

The response to this AMA is incredible, I wouldn't have possibly expected so much excitement for my book. My book is actually completely finished, it's just that I haven't actually gotten a publisher to bite. (Son here, please keep asking questions, I know there is quite the back log, but you should see the light in my pop's eyes when he thinks back to those times both good and bad. I'm at work right now, but soon I'll be back and we'll be answering as many questions as possible today!)

&#x200B;

My son (typing this) is helping me answer any of your questions you have on my experience.

&#x200B;

The key events from my childhood featured in my book include:

\-shattering every single one of my teeth

\-the murder of my father (for being a homosexual) > my theory

\-living with my alcoholic mother

\-hiding the above by deceiving the authorities and forging documents

\-my rape and my meticulously planned revenge

\-an unlikely friendship with an elderly Chinese grocer (who was my fence)

\-abandoning life with my mother and living on/off the streets

\-numerous encounters with the predators of San Francisco

&#x200B;

(Son here) My father has lived an incredible life and only recently have I truly begun to grasp the harrowing childhood he had. My father has always been a happy-go-lucky man who could always make me laugh and never showed me anything but his classic quirky demeanor. Needless to say, I was floored when he sat me down on my 16th birthday and told me his story. It has taken me a long time to even wrap my head around the fact that my weirdo dad that binges Scandinavian murder mysteries, and plays the ukulele is deep down a hard-as-nails bona fide survivor that knows pain I can't even begin to imagine.

&#x200B;

His words:

""The telling of this story has been 60+ years in the making, and it was with excruciating pain that I have finally finished recounting the demons that have haunted me since childhood into a 103000 word book. It is a story of my survival from age 7 on the streets of San Francisco after my father was murdered, and my mother that turned to alcohol for solace, amid a 20th century coming-of-age story of a hero's journey to the the depths of hell and back again.""

&#x200B;

[PICTURE PROOF (kinda) as you can imagine we can't exactly show you proof that any of this really happened, but hopefully you can accept the second chapter of his book as a taste of a book to come. Also included, a working picture of the cover.](https://imgur.com/a/iaO1OqZ)

&#x200B;

I'm gonna try and help my pop answer as many questions as possible (depending how popular this gets) Please feel free to ask questions unrelated to the book if you feel so inclined.

&#x200B;

TO BE CLEAR: THE BOOK IS NOT PUBLISHED YET. Still working out the kinks about getting it published in the first place.

I noticed dozens of other extremely suspicious patterns after spending the day analyzing the data.

The gears in my head started turning and I realized I could write a computer program to scrape all the reviews and perform a deep analysis in seconds rather than spending all day doing it manually. I could then point it at ANY product on Amazon and generate the same report. *This is when the idea for ReviewMeta was conceived*.

I launched ReviewMeta in 2016 - you may remember our video hitting the front page of /r/all \- the site got the Reddit Hug-o-Death: [https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/53i2wo/i\_analyzed\_18000000\_amazon\_reviews\_and\_prove\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/53i2wo/i_analyzed_18000000_amazon_reviews_and_prove_the/) (oh, and 3 weeks after the video, Amazon changed their TOS and banned incentivized reviews)

In case you're new around these parts, my name is Ben Brode, and I'm the Game Director on Hearthstone.
 
I'm responsible for the overall design of the game, as part of a team of badass folks. I started at Blizzard in 2003, and started working on Hearthstone in 2008. Nowadays I spend most of my times in meetings, talking about the sick designs that our talented team comes up with. I tend to stay pretty active here on Reddit and on Twitter (@bdbrode), but I am excited to solicit questions directly – Reddit /AMA’s format is super cool.  Having a dialog with the Hearthstone community is very important to me and the development team, and this is one of the easiest ways to facilitate that. I think Hearthstone is at its best when we work together to improve the game. Let's chat!

We're here to talk about your right to repair everything you own.

Gadgets are increasingly locked down and hard to fix, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Big money lobbyists have been taking away our freedoms, and it's time to fight back. We should have the right to fix our stuff! Right to repair laws can make that happen.

We’ve been working for years on this, and this year the New York legislature [overwhelmingly passed](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S4104) our electronics repair bill, 147-2. But if Governor Hochul doesn’t sign it by December 31, we have to start all over.

Consumer Reports is [calling for the Governor](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-hochul-empower-ny-consumers-right-to-repair-20221116-b4qhyysjxvd5tcy7aw7z7gx3ie-story.html) to pass it. Let’s get it done!

**We need your help!** Tweet at [@GovKathyHochul](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Gov%20Hochul%2C%20please%20pass%20digital%20Right%20to%20Repair%20so%20we%20can%20fix%20our%20stuff%21%20%40GovKathyHochul) and ask her to sign the Right to Repair bill! Bonus points if you include a photo of yourself or something broken.


Here’s a handy non-Twitter petition if you're in New York: [https://act.consumerreports.org/pd25YUm](https://act.consumerreports.org/pd25YUm)

Let’s also talk about:

* Tools
* Can a hundred tiny ducks fix a horse sized duck

I was hungry, hadn't eaten in 24hrs, was 48hrs from having my electricity shut off, a week from losing my apartment, and I had 0.33 in my bank account. The post blew up in a way I did not expect and I was able to pay my electric bill and buy food the next day. I reposted a few times asking for more money each time, and the number of customers continued to increase. I started getting reviews posted about my services and I quickly reached a point where scheduling became a nightmare and I was struggling to meet the demand without an organized system in place. I made the leap to buy a domain and build a website three days ago, and I raised my prices to $20 an hour. I've been booked solid the past four days and I'm equal parts excited and terrified.

I didn't submit to any big film festivals, I didn't shoot with Red or Alexa, and I didn't give up when a more experienced producer told me I would fail. Moreover, I broke just about every rule in the book, and disobeyed most of the traditional advice nuggets in the process. 

Feel free to ask me about working with Les Miles, Friday Night Lights' Brad Leland (Buddy Garrity), Parks and Rec's Jim O'Heir (Jerry Gergich), or any of the amazing actors involved. Moreover, feel free to ask about how I raised the money, how we found a distributor, and why I didn't submit to any big festivals.

EDIT 2 (2am CST) Lots of thoughts here. Number one: thank you Reddit users for upvoting the educational aspects of this AMA. I logged off right when some more vitriolic questions started to flow in, and my lack of reply didn't help. Luckily, the positive threads will be up top for those who are here for a learning experience, rather than to troll. That's thanks to the good people out there. Number two: lots of talk about IMDb rating and how it affects box office, and whether box office is overall profit or just theatrical profit. For those who don't know the different between the three, there's plenty. For those who do, feel free to fill in the blanks where I couldn't. Number three: Thank you to all of you who pitched in to help me answer questions and explain tougher concepts. Education is a community effort. 
Finally, I wish all of you the best in your endeavors. While there's no certain path in this industry, or any of them, I have hope that we'll all rise together. I'll log back on tomorrow and try to answer anything else I missed. Until every question is answered!"

A few brief predictions for 2019:

* **Cheaper oil = cheaper fares.** Airline CEOs spent much of the first half of 2018 predicting (wishing?) that airfare will get more expensive, pointing to the rising price of oil. But with the price of oil down 40% in last 3 months of 2018, one of the main drivers of expensive flights is off the table.
* **Worldwide economic slowdown is bad in general but probably good for airfare.** Many economists are predicting slower economic growth in 2019 and 2020. When times are tight, discretionary spending like vacations are one of the first items on a family's budget chopping block. Lower demand for plane seats will force the airlines to cut fares in an attempt to woo those travelers back.
* **Hawaii flights are going to get even cheaper.** Southwest is set to imminently begin flying from the mainland US to Hawaii (and between Hawaiian islands). Other airlines like Alaska, United, and American have already been dropping their fares in anticipation, but I expect that trend to continue even more in 2019. Plus with free checked bags and free changes/cancellations, many flyers will find Southwest's Hawaii flights especially valuable.
* **Mistake fares will continue.** Mistake fares are when an airline or online travel agency like Expedia or Orbitz accidentally offers fares that are *significantly* lower than normal. For instance, the $130 nonstop roundtrip flight from NYC to Milan that jumpstarted my career in cheap flights. Though not common, they show no signs of abating and should give flyers more opportunities at rare deals in 2019.

**Hello Reddit!**
My name is Scott Kelly. I am a NASA astronaut who has been living aboard the International Space Station since March of last year, having just passed 300 days of my [**Year In Space**](http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew), an unprecedented mission that is a stepping stone to future missions to Mars and beyond. I am the first American to spend a whole year in space continuously. 

On this flight, my fourth spaceflight, I also became the record holder for total days in space and single longest mission. A year is a long time to live without the human contact of loved ones, fresh air and gravity, to name a few. While science is at the core of this groundbreaking spaceflight, it also has been a test of human endurance. 

Connections back on Earth are very important when isolated from the entire world for such a period of time, and I still have a way to go before I return to our planet. So, I look forward to connecting with you all back on spaceship Earth to talk about my experiences so far as I enter my countdown to when I will begin the riskiest part of this mission: coming home.

Background: In 2015, Reddit helped Scott’s Cheap Flights grow from a free-time hobby to a full-time job. Since then:

* This little start-up has grown to 55 people (!) and still [hiring](https://scottscheapflights.com/careers)
* I published a real-life [book on finding cheap flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/take-more-vacations) that hit the bestseller lists (!!)
* I got to go on the talk show [Live w/ Kelly and Ryan](https://kellyandryan.com/video/planning-your-2021-vacation-with-scott-keyes/) (!!!). (Kelly is super nice and Ryan had the decency to feign personal interest in cheap flights)

Couldn’t have done it without you all, so every year I want to be sure to make myself available all day to answer any cheap flight/travel questions Redditors have.

(If you want to be alerted anytime cheap flights [from your home airport](https://scottscheapflights.com/) pop up it’d be our honor, but no pressure! I still want to help today whether or not you’re a Scott’s Cheap Flights member.)

The best part of my work is stumbling across Redditors who have gotten deals we flagged, like:

* [u/PistachiNO](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/sjv0gj/true/hvhre5o/?context=3): Italy for $200 roundtrip

Since I'm a radiologist, I want to show you my proof of all this like doctors show other doctors cases. I've tried to remove the really technical words and replace them with words that everyone will understand. If you're a medical person and want to read it in its full, annoying doctor shorthand glory, check out my post in [/r/medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/51o49k/32_yearold_previously_healthy_male_presents_with/). 

===============


**History of present illness:** The patient is a 32 year old male with a history vague and intermittent abdominal pain for the past two years. He has no other significant medical problems. Previously, the pain had been easily controlled with intermittent use of over the counter medications, but in the last couple of weeks had become acutely more painful and the pain became persistently present. On the day of presentation, the pain localized to the right lower quadrant which prompted the emergency room visit.

**Past medical/surgical history:** Well controlled high blood pressure. Prior sebaceous cyst and wisdom tooth removals.

**Meds/Allergies:** Lisinopril 20 mg daily (blood pressure med). No know drug allergies.

Other history non-contributory.

**Relevant labs:** Sedementation rate and C-reactive protein, both generalized markers of inflammation, are markedly elevated. Mild low blood counts with hemoglobin (basically, red blood cells) just below the normal cut-off. All other labs normal.

==========

Some brief information about radiology conventions: we diagnostic radiologists like to pretend we're real doctors, so we always ""look at the patient"" when reading studies. So basically it's like we're standing at the foot of the patient's bed and looking at them, in the same way that if you face someone and look to your left, you'll notice that's their right. So, functionally, left and right are reversed on our pictures. It starts to make sense after a while (but I now sometimes confuse left and right like a ~~kindergartner~~ 3-year-old. Thanks radiology!)

We also have 3 major planes of imaging: axial, coronal, and sagittal. A picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words, [so just look at this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/e9/6d/aa/e96daae82cf277634d93f43fe0839638.jpg) to understand what I'm talking about below, if it doesn't make sense.

And so without further ado, here's some proof of my shit-tastic disease:

=============

**Initial CT Scan**

1. [Axial CT at the level of the liver](https://imgur.com/UiWFaAL): Right from the get-go, things are looking grossly abnormal. There's organized fluid over the liver dome, which suggests it's thicker than just some water in the belly. There's some ill-defined, hazy shmutz (technical term) along the bottom curve of the stomach which is changing the appearance of the normal intra-abdominal fat. We radiologists say, ""fat is your friend"" because it looks black on CT. It helps separate out different structures so we can see where exactly something is. When there's too much white stuff on the black stuff, it tells us something isn't quite right.

2. [Axial CT at the level of the kidneys](http://imgur.com/i1xMvKU): More belly fluid and possibly some enlarged/big lymph nodes along the major blood vessels. If you look just ""above"" the spine (it's really in front - think about those imaging planes), that's where the blood vessels run and, in general, the lymphatic system runs with the blood vessels. The lymphatic system is basically part of your immune system, so when lymph nodes get big, it means that your immune system is trying to fight something. So that's where we look for evidence of disease outside of the primary location it started. It's hard to see anything discreet/measurable because everything is kind of smushed together and covered with belly fluid, but there's a round, abnormal nodule near or in part of the small intestine.

3. [Axial CT upper pelvis](http://imgur.com/CGYs1Ft): The right colon is ""jacked up,"" which is an official medical description. In all seriousness, though, there is a grossly abnormal appearance to the right sided large bowel, the colon, with significant wall thickening. See that big ugly circle thing on the left side of the picture (the radiology right side)? That's not normal *at all.* The bowel wall should be very thin, smooth, and uniform. Also, there's too much white stuff on the black stuff again in the middle of the belly. Something about it just doesn't look right after you've seen a bunch of normal scans and know what it's supposed to look like.

4. [Axial CT mid-pelvis](http://imgur.com/WuqgxTj): Well, on the plus side, it's not appendicitis. That big arrow is pointing to a normal appendix. You may have to take my word for it, though. Again note the abnormal appearance of the colon.

5. [Axial CT lower pelvis](http://imgur.com/JbxT192): This picture is lower down in the pelvis. Those big white things on either side are the pelvis bones. All that uniform appearing dark-ish stuff that's the same color as what the circle is drawn around is fluid. In a man, pelvic free fluid is never normal and should prompt a search for the underlying cause. In a woman, it's normal to see a small amount of free fluid. It's related to the menstrual cycle. But even this is way too much pelvic fluid for a woman, too.


===============

One thing people, even other doctors, sometimes don't understand about radiology is that, we're not *directly* looking at jack squat. These pictures are just a really fancy density map of the body. The white parts were where a bunch of x-rays get absorbed. The black parts are where a bunch of x-rays can pass through the tissue without getting absorbed. Everything else is a shade of grey, and we can only tell you, really, about the relative differences in density. 

Sometimes, that means we can make the diagnosis with great confidence. Radiologists call those ""aunt minnies,"" because it's so obvious that even your Aunt Minnie can see the finding. But more often than not, things look the same. A lot of diseases from very different categories (i.e., malignancy/cancer versus inflammatory versus autoimmune versus vascular, etc.) can look the same. And so we, as radiologists, try to look at the pictures, evaluate them, and then say what it could be, preferably in order of probability. We call that the differential diagnosis. Other physicians do the exact same thing with people's stories and labs. We just do it from the pictures.

So hopefully that will drive home this point: When everybody (the ER, the GI doctors, the surgeons, and the radiologists) looked at the pictures, this was our differential diagnosis: (1) inflammatory bowel disease (things like Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) (2) inflammatory bowel disease (3) inflammatory bowel disease (4) something besides inflammatory bowel disease. That is how I would still read a case like this, quite frankly. And it made sense. Those things *fit* with my age and symptoms. I wasn't some old guy with a bunch of cancer risk factors. I was actually in okay shape, just overweight according to my BMI (probably just from my huge, arnold-style muscles, duh). I exercised a few times a week. I don't think that cancer was even on anybody's radar at the time.

So what do you do when they think there's something wrong in the colon? They shove a camera up your butt. I got to drink a gallon of what is basically salt water to clean it all out before they could take a look. That stuff is nasty. Anyway, the colonoscopy was... normal. So I thought I was good. We still had that nodule thing up in the small bowel near the stomach, but it's not all *that* rare for people to have benign tumors in their GI tract (meaning, the fact that they're there and that the grow is not normal, but they won't turn into cancer). No one could explain the right colon findings to my satisfaction, but hey - at least I didn't have Crohn's disease, right! Hooray!

Well, we still had that mass in or near the small bowel. They stuck another camera down my throat, through my stomach, into the small bowel. The camera also comes with an ultrasound probe on the end, too (nifty, right?), and so they looked at that thing really close up and were able to take samples of it with a small needle by using the ultrasound pictures to guide them. We sent that off to the lab for the pathologists (the experts in tissue, and the people who are the gold standard test for making any cancer diagnosis). 

They also thought the CT scan didn't give them enough information, so they decided to get an MRI of the belly too. Just as an aside, CAT scan is like nails on a chalkboard to a radiologist. They're ""computed tomography"" scans. ""See Tee scans."" When you say CAT scan, [this is what I think of](https://imgur.com/6ZXalUD). And so now you know. And that's half the battle, as those important childhood lessons learned from GI Joe remind us all.

Just a bit about our radiology tests, too. People think that x-rays are the worst, then CT is better than that, and then MRI is the best of all. I mean, kind of. Really, you use different modalities depending on what question you're trying to answer. X-rays are actually still the best first test for a suspected broken bone, for instance. As I said above, CT makes a density map of the body, and that's useful for a lot of things, actually, too many to list here. 

But MRI is a bit different. In an MRI, we have a really strong, always-on (it's a superconducting magnet) magnetic field. It turns out that when you put protons into this field, just-over-half of them will ""line up"" in the direction of the magnetic field (the other slightly-fewer-than-half face the other way). Once we get everybody ""facing the same way,"" we shoot a radio pulse into the protons. This basically knocks them over, and as they stand back up to face the way they were facing before, they send some radio wave energy back out, and we can listen for that. And the *really* neat trick is that protons stand back up at different rates depending on their environment, so a proton inside of a pathologic lesion is almost certainly going to ""look"" different than one in normal tissue. So it's a lot easier to tell apart tissues of *juuuuuuust* a little bit of difference. Radiologists call this ""contrast resolution."" 

Anyway, here's what my MRI looked like:

=======================

**Initial MRI**

1. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/F0n1jR4): Since we know what the fat signal is going to be (since we know how fast fat protons ""stand back up""), we can send a signal into the scanner at the right time that's the exact opposite of the fat signal, and they cancel each other out. This is called ""fat suppression."" T2-weighted images a basically ""fluid sensitive"" images. If it's really bright on T2, it's probably fluid. So this is just proving that the stuff around the liver is fluid. 

2. [Axial fat-suppressed T2](http://imgur.com/0dFkebi): The stuff in the pelvis is also fluid. Look how it fills the potential spaces on either side of the urinary bladder. This is bad news bears.

3. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5YoolTC): C+ means that these pictures were taken after they gave contrast. Contrast (as is probably obvious from the name) helps you differentiate between tissue types. It's generally related to the amount of blood flow to the lesion. Since tumors like to grow, and growing things need nutrients, tumors secrete proteins that tell your body to build new blood vessels to them. So, tumors usually light up after you give people contrast. There's an abnormal enhancing lesion along the lesser curvature of the stomach, helpfully demarcated by the measurement tool. Additionally, note the abnormal enhancement around the margin of the spleen along the lining of the abdominal cavity.

4. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/AOZZsUt): This is what that small bowel nodule looks like on MRI. It's a bit easier to define the margins. It's still unclear whether this is inside or outside of the bowel, but it's definitely abnormal.

5. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/y9G8qsl): Grossly abnormal thickening and enhancement of the right colon. Some of the enhancement along the surface of the abdominal cavity is normal, and some is abnormal. Trying to figure out the difference can be VERY tough on MRI. When you're not sure if it's normal or abnormal, the diffusion sequences can be very helpful. Self-respecting tumors will generally restrict diffusion, a concept I will explain presently. See below for more info.

6. [Axial C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/cqllFHh): Enhancing nodule or lymph node in the right pelvis. Again, some of the belly surface enhancement is probably abnormal, but it can be difficult to determine how much enhancement is too much.

7. [Coronal C+ fat-suppressed LAVA](http://imgur.com/5qEVMpU): Just another picture of the nodule near the stomach/upper small bowel. You can also see the right colon, and the low signal fluid around the liver and spleen.

8. [Axial diffusion weighted image](http://imgur.com/FBOVwRG): Okay, so what is diffusion. Well, normally, water molecules are free to move around in the extracellular space. When you have something that causes swelling (edema is the fancy word), there is not only more water present, but it's also usually jammed into the cells in the area, and therefore less able to move around. So when we send in those radio pulses and then listen for the echo, water that can't move keeps getting more and more energy, and so the signal is higher. Water that gets hit by the radiowave but then moves out of the spot we're listening to will have low signal. So it's helpful to identify true swelling/edema. This image is at the level of the right colon. All of the high signal in the right colon is abnormal, and we know it's not just T2 shine-through because the same area is also dark on the ADC map (T2 shine-through is bright on both).

9. [Axial ADC map](http://imgur.com/upjTXi1): Just to confirm the diffusion restriction. If you don't understand the whole DWI-ADC map relationship, that's okay. It doesn't really matter for the story.

Well, the biopsy results finally come back. The differential diagnosis for the way the stuff looked under the microscope is read by the pathologists as, ""florid mesothelial hyperplasia versus peritoneal mesothelioma."" I looked all of this crap up about 15 seconds after I got the phone call from the GI fellow with the results. I had never even heard of it, and I'm a freaking doctor. When you say, ""mesothelioma,"" everyone thinks (1) asbestos exposure and (2) it's a lung cancer (technically, it's a cancer of the lining of the lung, but that's semantics).

When taken in conjunction with the MRI findings, this is highly concerning for malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. But they still weren't 100% sure, so we had to stick some cameras in my belly to take a look. They did that and took a bunch of samples. They were also doing it to see how much disease was in there (I mean, look at those pictures. There's some really fucked up shit going on inside me). 

We didn't think I was a surgical candidate when all of this started. People who can't get the surgery and the cancer removed have an abysmal prognosis. Like, 6-18 months type of prognosis. Well fuck. 

They have a system to estimate the extent of disease, called the [peritoneal carcinomatosis index](http://www.surgicaloncology.com/gpmindic.htm). It's a scale that goes from 0 to 39, and the bigger the number the worse it is. Based on the MRI , my index was 31/39. Almost all of the published literature and studies on this shows that patients above a PCI of ~12-13 don't do well. The final tissue diagnosis is malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, epitheliod subtype. 

As luck would have it, there happens to be a team of oncologists where I'm training, both surgical and medical, that specializes in cancers that have spread to the abdominal surface. The team decided to try a two-step surgical approach, that was developed at Columbia in NYC, which has taken people with really bad disease and made their outcomes similar to those of people with lower PCIs. The general idea is this: get the worst of it out with a first debulking surgery. If there's anything there that's going to make the surgery really hard, or force the surgeon to remove an entire organ that they really kind of don't want to take out, they leave it. After the surgery, you do chemotherapy in the abdomen, and then later you go back in for a final surgery where the goal is to take out everything they see. With both of the surgeries, too, they do something called heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). The idea is that, you can physically remove the bulky disease you can see, but there are probably microscopic cancer cells you gotta kill too. That's what the HIPEC is supposed to do.

So, we go to surgery. They took out my spleen, distal pancreas, gallbladder, right and transverse portions of my colon, all of the omentum (stuff that covers the bowel), and a bunch of the lining along my diaphragms (the muscles that move your lungs) and throughout the belly. It took them 12 hours to do the first surgery and HIPEC. Obviously, this is a huge ordeal and I'm in the intensive care unit for the first few days after surgery and everything hurts like a motherfucker. I learned during that hospitalization that Dilaudid is my homie. I don't know how I would have tolerated the pain without a drug that's basically as powerful as heroin. Also, I'm pretty sure I know how it feels to do heroin, so, thanks for that too, cancer.

They used cisplatin for the HIPEC procedure, and that drug is well-known for being very effective, but also for having the potential to trash your kidneys. I still to this day don't know exactly how this happened, but instead of getting just a dose to the inside of my abdomen and a *tiny* bit absorbed by the rest of my body, I get a *fuckton* absorbed by the rest of my body, and it pissed off my kidneys somethin' *fierce,* as we say in the south.

I went into acute kidney failure. They hoped that the injury would hit the peak of its badness and then I'd start to get better and my kidneys will start working again. It doesn't happen. After 4 days of continually worsening renal function, they decide I need dialysis. So we go down to interventional radiology (aka, IR) and they put a [tunneled line exactly like this](https://www.healthqare.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vascularaccess-300x275.jpg) into my chest and right sided neck vein. The medical term is a ""right internal jugular central venous catheter."" To translate from ""doctor"" to ""normal English speech,"" you need a big honkin' hose to be able to move enough blood to do dialysis. I ended up being in the hospital for about 10 days all together.

I figured I'd be on dialysis for a few days. Not a good event to have happen, obviously, but ultimately no big deal. Nope, it was way worse than that. I had to be dialized 5 days in a row in the hospital, and then we started doing it ""only"" three times a week. Even after I was discharged, I was on dialysis for two months until my kidneys recovered enough on their own that things like my electrolyte levels weren't getting out of whack anymore. You can die from fatal heart rhythms from having too much potassium in your body, for instance. 

Another fun complication I had with all of this was a big ass clot where the catheter was in my vein. This happened maybe 4 days after I was discharged. It shouldn't have been a surprise, really. When you start listing the risk factors for blood clots, I had almost all of them: cancer, recent surgery, immobility, indwelling foreign device. My right arm felt tight all day, and then I looked in the mirror and noticed that the right side of my face was swollen. That little spot behind your collar bone where the skin kinda dips down was completely gone. It was puffed out the other way, actually. When I went to the ER, it was such a slam dunk diagnosis that they didn't even bother doing anything except starting me on blood thinners.

When you have blood clots like that, you can't wait around for the oral blood thinners to kick in. You have to start people on blood thinners that work right away, most often heparin. Doctors call this ""bridging"" someone. The thing that sucks about heparin is that there's no one dose that's great for everyone. You have to give it to people and then check a lab value related to clotting times (the PTT), and adjust the rate of heparin accordingly until you get the person to ""their"" dose. So basically you gotta get stuck a lot so they can test your blood.

I already have a one in a million cancer, but I also found out that day that heparin doesn't work on me. They kept giving me more and more and checking the labs all the time and they didn't budge, so they had to use a newer, way more expensive drug, and I was going to be in the hospital being ""bridged"" to the oral blood thinner (warfarin aka Coumadin). You can't safely discharge people until the warfarin is at a therapeutic level, so once again I was sitting in the hospital just waiting. Waiting for one freaking number to be above 2. 

It took 6 days in the hospital to get there. The hospital is boring as fuck. The food sucks. You see your doctors for 3 minutes a day and then never again until the next day. They talk about you outside your room before they come in, and you can hear them. It was especially annoying for me, because I understood all the things they were talking about. Why wasn't I included in the discussion? I'm both the patient in question *and* a doctor.  

Though, you get demoted real fucking fast when you put on that hospital gown. If you have any kind of title you worked hard for, and are proud of - things like captain, reverend, colonel, doctor, professor - and prefer to be addressed by, well, get used to ""mister."" All of the sudden, I was a ""mister."" Nurse practitioners fresh out of school (I'm 9 years down the medical education rabbit hole at this point) with less clinical experience than a third year medical student were calling me ""mister."" It was then that I realized I had truly become ""the patient.""

But, time's arrow moved, as it does, ever forward, and I finally got out of the hospital. I wasn't out of the hospital (for the second time) for more than a day or two before the next fun complication reared its head. There was a spot in my surgical wound which had always been little firmer than the rest of the tissue. Something wasn't quite right about it, but it looked okay and I didn't have any symptoms. But, on that day, I noticed that my shirt was soaked, and something didn't smell particularly good. The dressing of the wound was also soaked. I took it off to look at the wound, and it was pretty clear that it was infected. 

We went *back* to the hospital. The surgery resident came and saw me. With big gross infected wounds like that, you can't just sew it back up. It will almost certainly get infected and form an abscess if you do that. No, open wounds have to heal by what doctors call ""secondary intention"" or, as I prefer to say, from the bottom up. You have to keep it open and let the tissue fill into the gap. But obviously you also want to clean it so it doesn't get infected again, so you shove wet gauze into it, let it try, then take it out and then repeat the process until it's healed. This is a ""wet-to-dry"" dressing, and every time you take it out, it removes some of the nasty crap from the wound and leaves only the good ""beefy red"" granulation tissue (what a delightful description, no?) .

When I say it was big and gross, it was. Actually, I'm a weird guy (duh, radiologist) so I took pictures of it as it healed. [This is what it looked like the day after we opened it up in the office](https://i.imgur.com/1hPeaxU.jpg). My only regret is that I forgot to include a banana for scale. But, that smaller hole down inside the big hole is actually an opening right into the abdominal cavity. I could have stuck my finger down through that thing and touched my own intestines. I didn't, because that seems gross and also like a pretty bad idea, but I *could* have. It took this bad-boy about a month to heal up.

Also, with the open wound on my belly, and the dialysis catheter dangling out of the right side of my chest, I basically couldn't take a shower. I would sit on the edge of the tub and wash the important bits (you know what I'm talking about) and try to keep everything else as dry as possible. I don't know about you, but a nice shower in the morning is one of those small pleasures in life (right up there with the pee shivers after holding it in forever). 

And sometimes, you don't appreciate things until they're gone. I sure as shit didn't appreciate things like, ""not being in pain all the time"" or ""not throwing up bile every day because you actually still have your gallbladder."" And, quite frankly, my previous good health. I took it as a given. I was only 32 when I was diagnosed. I'm not supposed to have any serious medical problems at that age. Certainly not something life-threatening. And *certainly* not something that's as likely, on a statistical level, as it is to [have a major earthquake on the Hayward fault within the next 50 minutes and other rare things that almost certainly won't happen](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/million.html). This is not a go-to diagnosis. This is a, ""what the actual fuck"" diagnosis.

===============

I finally thought I was doing better. I felt better. It was 3 months out from the surgery, and my wound had finally closed and I was finally able to eat okay and get calories in me and gain weight. I lost about 25 lbs from this ordeal and to this day I still find it very difficult to eat more than a small meal and put on weight. The silver lining, and perhaps something people might envy, is that I can eat whatever the hell I want and still look pretty good. I eat a ton of garbage food now in an attempt to gain weight. My last 3 dinners have been domino's, taco bell, and wendy's, for example.  I'm scared I'm going to lose a bunch of weight again and look like nothing but skin and bones after the next surgery.

But the fun wasn't over yet! Remember how I said we were gonna do intra-abdominal chemo between surgeries? Well, we had started that at this point, and the way we were getting it into the belly was through what we call ""ports."" You may have heard about those before. They're usually used to have permanent, long term IV access in a safe way. They have a long tube that goes basically wherever you want it (vein, belly, whatever) connected to a hub or reservoir that they access with a needle, put in whatever med you're using, and then take the needle out. The reservoir is placed under the skin so they don't get infected (you access them with sterile technique). [1 picture == 1000 words](http://img.medicalexpo.com/images_me/photo-g/69647-9309172.jpg).

Anyway, we placed two, initially. What were the odds that both would fail? Well, as you may be picking up by now, I'm one lucky motherfucker, because the one that was on the left side just stopped working and really hurt when they would attempt to flush it out with saline. So we stopped using that one. On the right, the stitches holding the reservoir failed, and the port started moving under the skin. Actually, it started tilting forward and pressing out on the skin. It actually really hurt. 

One advantage I do have with all this is that I have better access to my doctors than the average bear. I have their work email addresses and pager numbers. So I got in touch and met up with my surgical oncologist. We both looked at it and agreed it needed to be revised, but it was a Friday evening when this took place. We planned on doing it early the next week. Instead, [it eroded through the skin the next day](http://i.imgur.com/lSndrhD.jpg). I got to enjoy that over the weekend.

And as you might imagine, once that happens it has to come out. And I had no access for the chemo I was supposed to get. So we went back to IR, took out both of the failed ports, and through something of a minor miracle, they were able to successfully place an intra-abdominal port in IR. All of us were skeptical it would work. One thing that happens after just about any belly surgery is that you get scar tissue in the belly. We call them adhesions. They prevent things from moving around as easily as they should, and can sometimes even cause bowel obstructions in people. One of the more common general surgery procedures, actually, is ""lysis of adhesions"" - they break up the adhesions from a prior surgery if they have to go back in for some reason. But the IR doc was able to sneak the catheter past all of that stuff and got it into position.

===========

And that's basically where we're at. The most recent port problem happened about a month ago. I had to pack that one, too, but it was a lot smaller than the big wound and healed up in about 3 weeks. This thing really knocked me on my ass at a really inopportune time in my life. My now-wife and I had just gotten engaged on New Year's Eve, and I was diagnosed in early March of this year. I actually asked her if she was sure she wanted to ""stay in the game"" with me, so to speak. I would have understood if the answer was no. Truly I would have. This is fucking up her life almost as much as mine, at this point. But, and this is why I locked that shit down ASAP, my wife is the most amazing person I know. She told me to stop being a ridiculous idiot and that our wedding date was already set, so I'd better get to planning. 

She is without question the love of my life.

Anyway, here are some fun stats you might not know about malignant peritoneal mesothelioma: it exists. The incidence is about one in a million. There are about 300 cases of this per year in the US. The average age of diagnosis is about 60. It's not as clearly related to asbestos exposure as the pleural variety. People with high PCIs generally don't do well, but that's often because they're not surgical candidates. The single most important factor for survival is the completeness of cytoreduction - if they can get all the disease out, people do better. You can go from a PCI of 39 to 0 with a good surgery.

The epitheliod subtype has the best outcomes (outside of an even more rare cystic variant which is almost always seen in women). There's also a sarcomatous variety and a mixed type, both of which do worse.

===============


I have to take the radiology boards in November and then we go right back to surgery after that. It's unclear if I get to keep my stomach; I'll find out what they had to do to get rid of all the disease only after I wake up in the ICU. The thing that scares me the most about the next surgery is the possibility of another severe kidney injury which would probably put me on permanent dialysis. I'm now chronic kidney disease stage III (V is dialysis dependent, so I'm a bit over halfway there!). But I don't really have any underlying risk factors that would continue to degrade my kidney function, so I could do okay for a long time like that without another huge insult. Again, only time will tell. Feeling out of control of your life is very frustrating and scary, particularly for people like doctors who all think we're in total control of everything in life. Protip: we're not. 

After the second surgery, I should be at a cytoreduction score of 0, meaning they got everything out. At least, that's the plan. After that, they want to do more chemo, but this time intravenous/system with a platinum based drug and pemetrexed, a derivative of methotrexate, and the only medicine FDA approved for mesothelioma. 

One of the most famous guys in this field, Dr. Sugarbaker (the one in DC, not MD Anderson) put a series of 29 patients on a protocol of cytoreductive surgery, early post-operative intra-abdominal chemo, and then 6 cycles of cisplatin + long term intra-abdominal alimta. They're projecting their 10 year survival in those patients to be as high as 73%. I'm going to push my team to go in the same direction, if they'll offer that therapy to me. 

It may sound stupidly optimistic, but I think I actually have a shot at a very good outcome. And I also think this has made me a better/more empathetic doctor. I understand now what patients go through. Little things matter to them/us. It's nice when people go out of their way to make sure your scan and your appointment are on the same day, for instance. It's even more important when you're talking to patients who drive 1-2 hours (or more) just to get to the hospital. They really appreciate stuff like that. 

I learned that I need to go out of my way to introduce myself to people *before* you do a procedure on them. In a training hospital, often, the lower level residents go do the pre-procedure paperwork and the upper level residents just operate or do cases all day. Someone you have never met, whose name you don't know, may be sticking their hand (or at least a wire) into your body while you're unconscious. I met the surgical oncology fellow, for instance, as I was counting backwards from 10 falling asleep from the anesthesia. You know, that monstrous, 12 hour beast of a case that this whole thing has been about. In my head, I went, ""Whatt thhhhhheeee fuuuuu [out]."" I will never do a case on someone who doesn't know my name, and whose hand haven't shaken (well, unless the patient doesn't want to shake my hand).

I went into radiology specifically to do interventional radiology, but now I'm absolutely chomping at the bit to get back into the clinical world. I want to drop TACE and Y-90 beads (procedures to treat cancer that has started in or spread to the liver) into all kinds of bad things for people so they can give cancer the big ""fuck you."" I want to actively do things to help patients, like, all the time now. Not that I was a complete dick before or anything, but after this kind of experience, you just ""get it.""

Lastly, it also taught me that there's no time like the present to start living your life. I got married to the love of my life a couple weeks ago and we just got back from a super-kickass honeymoon. I plan on continuing to do awesome things with the people who matter until I literally can't get out of bed. 

Fuck cancer, and ask me anything!

(And [now I will shamelessly plug my scuba diving footage from the aforementioned honeymoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb3OASSR3pg), just like those professors who put the pictures they took on vacation in their powerpoints. I actually worked really hard on it, so please check it out my friends!)

hdesc7,"I'm Carole Turek, a 70-year old photographer, and my quest is to photograph every hummingbird species on the planet! So far I have photographed 150 of 350+ species. In February 2020 I climbed 18 miles up a mountain in northern Colombia to photograph one of the rarest hummingbirds in the world.

My home in Studio City, California now attracts hundreds of them daily.  There are so many hummingbirds here now that I decided to share them with the world on a live cam.

&#x200B;

I began photographing my birds and my passion for photography grew to where I had to find more species of hummingbirds to photograph.  I started with trips to Arizona, but to find more and more beautiful hummingbirds to photograph, I had to start traveling to Central and South America.

&#x200B;

My last trip before all travel came to a halt was to northern Colombia to photograph the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest, one of the rarest hummingbirds in the world.  To reach this critically-endangered hummingbird one must seek permission from the indigenous tribes and then trek up to an elevation of 10,000 feet to arrive at the last remaining territory of this hummingbird.  The bird is so rare that it was thought to be extinct until five years ago.

&#x200B;

Less than one hundred people alive have seen it (there actually is an ""I've Seen the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest Club"") and only a handful of people have actually photographed one.  We have created three episodes to show the world our journey to the páramo at the Lagos de Sevilla in the Santa Marta Mountains of northern Colombia, where the Blue-bearded Helmetcrest can be found.  You can watch these episodes here:  [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNVQIhPFF34), [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UFnTnasbAs), [Day 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iTDA4MZBAM).

&#x200B;

All of my past and future photography trips are being documented on my [YouTube channel, Hummingbird Spot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9WO9hqKmaAccZqCgeOw4w). So far I have photographed 150 of the 350+ hummingbird species that are scattered over Central and South America.  We will be traveling from the Amazon rainforest to the peaks of the Andes Mountains!  Come with me!

Mass O' Kyzt is a game wherein you upgrade your enemies. Each round, you will be prompted to make your enemies stronger, faster or tougher.

Signing off now, but let's do another one sometime next year.  


My name is Boyan Slat, and I am the founder and CEO at The Ocean Cleanup. The Ocean Cleanup is a non-profit organization developing and scaling technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic. We plan to do this by cleaning up the legacy plastic - the plastic already floating in the ocean - and by “closing the tap” through river plastic interception. The goal is to put ourselves out of business once the oceans are clean.

See a summary of The Ocean Cleanup and what we do here: [https://youtu.be/8HQEd\_IX6A8](https://youtu.be/8HQEd_IX6A8)

Throughout the years of developing ocean technology, we continually improved cleanup design, working towards a fleet of systems capable of eradicating the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This October, with System 002, also known as “Jenny,” we successfully achieved proof of technology after repeatedly harvesting plastic, from tiny debris fragments to huge ghost nets. From nine test extractions, we collected a total of 28,659 kilograms (63,182 pounds) of plastic from the ocean. Learn more about System 002 proof of technology and what it means here: [https://youtu.be/-Tt88hdVCpo](https://youtu.be/-Tt88hdVCpo)

The crew is now back in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch to start the cleanup.

I want to let you know that this is actually me and not my stoned ghost (see:http://imgur.com/gpVpsZJ ).  I’m not actually dead!  Woohoo!!   

Cheech & Chong consist of myself and my comedy partner Cheech Marin.  We released albums, movies and toured the country in the ‘70s and ‘80s.  Our most famous movie without a doubt that people recognize us for to this day is “Up In Smoke.”  The reaction to “Up In Smoke” was incredible and it is a movie I am most proud of.  I directed Up In Smoke, Cheech & Chong’s Next Movie, Nice Dreams, Still Smoking, Far Out Man and The Corsican Brothers.  We have been credited as pioneers of the legalization of marijuana and the popularizers of cannabis in pop culture. 

Something you may not know about me is that I was also in a band signed to Motown prior to being part of Cheech & Chong and we had a hit record and even played with the Jackson 5 once before they were famous called Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers.  

Recently I’ve been working in my shed a lot making pipes and art in my house in the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles.  I have been out of jail for over a decade after being incarcerated in 2003 as part of Operation Pipe Dreams for the selling of bongs.  I was on Dancing With The Stars a year ago, which was really fun.  I made a web talk show over the summer and I'm going to be making more videos.  Cheech & I are still very good friends.  2015 and the near future is almost like the completion of this plot arc of a movie I've been playing a character in my entire life and I am now seeing the dream of full cannabis legalization, actually come true.  It's amazing and we have truly come a long way.

Hi, this is Sean Evans and Chris Schonberger, host and creator (respectively) of the hit YouTube series Hot Ones, and we're back on Reddit to answer your spicy questions. 

The concept of our show is simple: We interview celebrities while making them eat a series of increasingly hot chicken wings. Through eight seasons and more than 160 episodes, we've had guests like [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9DyHthJ6LA), [Scarlett Johansson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR5kfWXfxto), and [Ken Jeong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WQHDUYk310) take on the wings of death. 

You can catch new episodes on Thursdays, 11am ET on [First We Feast's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPD_bxCRGpmmeQcbe2kpPaA)—the Season 9 premiere is coming May 23. We're here to answer YOUR hot questions! We won't be eating wings (we are eating pizza though).

We looked into questions like what would happen if you swam out of a deep sea submarine, were swallowed by a whale (surprisingly possible), your elevator cable broke (don’t jump. It won’t help), if it’s even possible to die from magnetism (it is, yay!), if sticking your hand in the CERN particle accelerator is lethal (probably) and many more.

61n0f9,Two years ago I quit my job and started a business that I grew to 7-figures in revenue from my apartment.

In May of 2015, inspired by a trip to a grocery store in China, I decided to start an online business to sell international snacks! We delivers a box of snacks from a different country around the world each month straight to your door! The moment of epiphany occurred when I purchased a Choco Pie (it's a Korea chocolate coated marshmallow snack), a snack that loved as a kid, and I remembered thinking “It's a real shame most people from outside of Asia will never have a chance to try this.”

At this point in time I’d recently quit my job to pursue my dreams of starting a business, so when I got the idea I dove right in. I went to the local ethnic markets around me and bought all the snacks I could find in order to determine if I actually enjoyed eating snacks from other countries. To my relief I did! Over a period of three months, from the living room of my apartment (and with about $5000 in savings), I built a website, found a warehouse, and laid the groundwork for the launch of the company. At the end of July 2015 the website was live and the company officially in business.

The business has since grown exponentially and it’s been an exhilarating experience throughout. During the first six months I felt like I was in a constant fight for survival - to build the company, launch it, and grow fast enough before I ran out of money. To maximize the amount of cash that could put in the business, I put all my personal expenses on my credit card, racking up thousands in debt. I also took on personal and business loans to keep the company afloat as it was growing. 

Throughout this entire process, I made a ton of mistakes and learned a lot of lessons, and I’d love to answer any questions you might have about my experiences, business, snacks, or anything! AMA

(If you're curious you can check out Scott's Cheap Flights [here](https://scottscheapflights.com/), but zero pressure. Honestly!)

To say thanks, once a year or so I like to pop in and spend the day talking cheap flights and answering all your questions, travel or otherwise. And also to celebrate Redditor’s success stories getting cheap flights, including:

* [u/Dhawk777](http://reddit.com/user/Dhawk777)’s Denver-Tokyo flight for [$214 roundtrip](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/mx2pa2/american_is_offering_200_round_trip_flights_to/gvlrz0l/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

(If you’ve been able to book a cheap flight recently give a shout in the comment section—I wanna celebrate with you!)

And now, after years of being asked “what’s your secret to finding cheap flights?” I finally got my shit together and compiled everything I know into a book out next week, [***Take More Vacations: How to Search Better, Book Cheaper, and Travel the World***](https://scottscheapflights.com/take-more-vacations)**.**

One of my goals in this book was to cut through the BS misconceptions that get parroted elsewhere as cheap flight advice, like “clear your cookies” or “book on Tuesdays at 1pm.”

Instead, the way I’ve been able to travel to places like Milan for $130 roundtrip and Japan for $169 roundtrip (and help millions of SCF members get cheap flights as well) is not through useless “hacks” but by changing the entire *strategy* of planning travel.

More than anything, my goal with the book is to help readers avoid the regret that so commonly plagues older folks: “I wish I’d traveled more when I had the chance.”

**Among the myriad topics I get into in the book (and happy to discuss here!):**

* How the way you’ve been searching for flights leads you to overpay (and how to do better)
* All the steps you can take even when you don’t have flexibility
* Why expensive fares are optional now that we’re in the Golden Age of Cheap Flights
* Why big cities get the *most* deals but small cities (think Dayton, Ohio or Cody, Wyoming) get the *best* deals
* How to take the perfect vacation, according to science
* The basics (when to book, where to book, etc.) and advanced tips (mistake fares, 24-hour rule, building your own layovers, etc.)
* Commonly believed myths, from searching in incognito to dressing nicely for an upgrade to flying being better back in the day
* Why cheap flights don’t just save you money, but lead to more and *happier* trips

**Other current topics I’m glad to speak to if you’ve got questions:**

* Europe travel for Americans this summer
* Vaccine passports fact & fiction
* Will fares go up as the pandemic wanes? (Spoiler: No! Don’t let them trick you into overpaying!)
* Mistake fares (like $63 roundtrip to Chile or $309 roundtrip to Morocco, both in the past year) or why airlines occasionally sell [$202 roundtrip flights to Japan](https://www.travelandleisure.com/flight-deals/scotts-cheap-flights-newsletter-deals)
* Whatever questions you’re curious about!

On the show, I play Dean Simms, Desna’s autistic brother, and I wanted to take this opportunity to give back to the community I have the privilege of representing. So I’m launching an [app](http://smarturl.it/haroldperrineau) to share exclusive behind-the-scenes looks at upcoming projects, share the adventures I have with my own family, and donating all proceeds this month to the [Autistic Self Advocacy Network](http://autisticadvocacy.org/), an organization run for and by autistic people. Taking on this role has taught me so much about their incredible work educating communities, supporting self-advocacy and improving public perceptions of autism and ultimately creating a world where autistic people can enjoy equal rights and opportunities. Ask away!

**EDIT @1:45pmPST:** Hey guys, taking a quick break to take my kids to the farmer's market before it closes but I'll be back in a few to answer more questions, promise! You can follow along on my [app]
(http://smarturl.it/haroldperrineau), it's free to download, but all voluntary proceeds will go to the ASAN. Be back in a sec!


**EDIT:** Thank you guys for all the great questions, it’s been a blast. Have to jump off now but I’ll continue to answer questions on my app. Download it, let me know what causes are important to you on there, and I’ll pick my favorite, give you a Skype call and we can highlight that cause next! I’ll be watching the finale tonight too so I’d love to get some live questions and comments!

I truly love what this plant stands for and what it has the potential to do for humanity on a medicinal/agricultural/humanistic level. So I made it part of my mission to de-stigmatize this plant.  In my mind there’s only a few things that unite the world not matter what color/sex/race/religion/etc- Love Fear, Food and Music. So here I am, tryin to do some good in this world. 

Here’s some cool stuff I’ve been able to do over the years:

- von Miller called me the GOAT one time and I thought he was referring to the animal
- Was called last minute and cooked on Viceland for Bong Apatite 
- cooked for famous people
- Cooked with Juicy J in my tiny ass apartment 
https://imgur.com/gallery/xnQSK
- Cooked with Vitaly for a show I hosted
https://youtu.be/darfkiGeAu4
- Cooked for the Porsche racing team
- Was on CNN, Forbes, Fox News, The Guardian, Reuters, AFP, Fast Times, GQ, Elle Magazine, and many more talking about Cannabis
- I went cliff jumping and cracked my tooth 
- Speak at the National Restaurant Association annually
- Speak at ACF Chefs, Catersource, New England Food Expo, and more about Culinary Cannabis 
- u/here_comes_the_king shared my YouTube video once (I still have yet to cook for him)
- Eat at the #2 ranked restaurant in the world while High and got to meet one of my idols and favorite chefs ever 
- Created food experiences for thousands of people 
- Slept out of my car for a long while to build myself
- Woodworked plates for our guests 
- Written for a few publications 
- We lobbied (along with a few really awesome other companies) to get on-site consumption licenses available AND GOT THEM ON
- We’re hoping to open up the first Cannabis infused restaurant the world has seen

Edit #2: 
I have to say, Reddit, It’s got me a little emotional to see how many people are thinking about others in this thread.  A lot of you really want to see something done for the people wrongfully incarcerated with non-violent marijuana charges, a lot want to see patients being helped, and a lot want to see education become more widely available.  I love this.  It’s why I jumped into this and left UCSC.  I knew that this plant would be able to help with these societal issues.  Systematic issues even.  

If I could just say one thing, it would be that I am trying so damn hard to do something positive.  I didn’t have big business experience prior to this endeavor, every day that my company grows, I am in a whole shitstorm of “idk what the fuck to do” and learning every step of the way. While trying to be an activist i still have to consider how to pay my bills, try and be normal and social, and see family. I am just one person and we have a very small team, but I can promise you this.  I am relentless in my efforts to make a more positive, healthier, open world. I hope you can understand that I don’t have all the answers, but I am working towards it all. 


So much love to all of you. 


I’ll be answering questions throughout the day still as my time permits, but I wanted to say THANK YOU for what has been an incredibly insightful and moving experience. 


Edit#3. TL;DR 
- We are not all about getting high, we believe in the plant is multifaceted in its uses. 

- We serve a 10 course menu with 10mgTHC over the course of the evening along with 6-8oz of wine to create a feeling of euphoria without being overwhelmed. 

- We believe that you should wait until your brain is more fully developed before using cannabis, this is highly debated and I can’t really give a year or age although it seems 18-25years is when the prefrontal cortex is fully developed (http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/02/18/at-what-age-is-the-brain-fully-developed/)

I Have over 30 years’ experience in the Pharmaceutical Industry and have worked at larger companies such as Bayer, Novartis, Watson, Cardinal Health, and Allergan before starting my own pharmaceutical Company. Currently we have two Product ventures Impavido (miltefosine)- the drug I’m here to talk to you about, and Rhinase nasal products. If you have any questions about my experience ask away, but I'm sure you are more interested in the Brain Eating Amoeba, and I am interested in Spreading awareness so let me dive right into that!

Naegleria fowleri (commonly known as the “Brain eating Amoeba”) causes a brain infection called Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) that is almost always fatal (97%). In the United States only three people had ever survived PAM. Two of them were on Miltefosine, our newly acquired drug (It’s FDA indication is for the treatment of Leishmaniasis- a rare tropical disease). Sebastian Deleon marks the 4th survivor and the 3rd on our medication.

We work closely with Jeremy Lewis from the Kyle Cares Organization (http://www.kylelewisamoebaawareness.org/) and Steve Smelski of the Jordan Smelski Foundation for Amoeba Awareness Stephen (http://www.jordansmelskifoundation.org/). Please check them out and learn more!

Profounda has started a consignment program for Impavido (miltefosine) and hospitals. We offer Impavido to be stocked free of charge in any hospital, accepting payment only once the drug is used. We also offer to replace any expired drug at no charge. When minutes count, we want the drug on hand instead of sitting in a warehouse. In the past, the drug was kept on hand by the CDC in Atlanta and flown out when it was needed. In the case of Jordan Smelski who was a Patient in Orlando, it took 10 hours for the drug to reach him. He passed away 2 hours before the drug reached the hospital. We want to get this into as many Hospitals as we can across the country so that no one has to wait hours again for this lifesaving treatment. 

So far only 6 hospitals have taken us up on the offer.

Anyways, while I can go on and on, that’s already a lot of Information so please feel free to AMA!

My name is Eric Sanders (although I was originally called Ignaz Schwarz) and I was born in Vienna in 1919. 

As a Jew I escaped the Nazis and headed to London where I luckily arrived in 1938. I joined the British Army and eventually the SOE (Special Operations Executive). Since the end of the war I have written several plays and a script for the film 'Nasser' along with two autobiographies (one in German and the other in English) and have now turned my eye, at the wonderfully ripe age of 97, towards writing books.

I have just finished writing a two part book called Mazes (blurb here: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71VR4-JXffL.jpg) and I will also be holding a book launch event at the BAFTA venue on Saturday 16th September, feel free to PM me if you are interested in attending!

ejmp7u,I breed pigeons that are bred and trained to steal other pigeons.

Example of one of my thief pouters [here](https://v.redd.it/b2pt9v0cbe841).

Little background: Thief pouters have been around for centuries. In the beginning, they were used to steal racing pigeons from others as the birds returned home. 

This practice was eventually outlawed, naturally, since no one likes having their stuff stolen. That's when thief breeders turned on each other and started (sometimes not so) friendly competitions to see who could capture whose birds. If someone else's thief caught your thief, they got to keep it. Those are the rules of the game.

As the hobby spread out to other countries/continents, there were fewer people to compete with, so breeders started practicing what is called ""zuritero"" - which is where they compete to see who can catch the most feral pigeons. 

While catching ferals lacks some of the excitement of trying to steal other thieves, it does present its own challenges. Ferals are much more wary of people and pigeon lofts than a domestic pigeon would be, so it can be hard for the thieves to actually lure them into the loft. 

AMA about pigeons, thief pouters, or whatever you want to ask me - related or not.

Edit: [Here's](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/06/doo-pigeons-flying-scotland/) an article National Geographic did on the hobby in Scotland. It's pretty big over there.

As a 24-year industry veteran, I've seen a lot of change, but I remain committed to the concept of alternative competitive broadband access services, which is why I continue to fight for net neutrality. 

Sonic firmly believes that internet providers should NOT be able to charge content creators—like Netflix or CNET—more money to stream their service, or have the ability to block others entirely. The internet should remain open and equal for all. Sonic will continue to do everything it can to stand up for net neutrality, whether the regulations require it or not.

I’ll be sticking around to answer your questions on net neutrality and what’s at stake for you and everyone else who uses and loves the internet amid the FCC’s pending rollback of net neutrality regulations. Ask away!

Suddenly, the conveyor belt started up and I went on a ride that changed my life forever.

I spent 16 days in the hospital where doctor's focused on placing a rod and screws into my left arm (which the rod and screws eventually became infected with MRSA and had to be removed out of the arm) and to apply skin grafts to areas where I had 3rd degree burns from the friction of the belt.

To date, I have had 12 surgeries with more in the future mostly to repair my left arm and 3rd degree burns from the friction of the belts.

The list of injuries include:

*Broken humerus 
*5 shattered ribs 
*3rd degree burns on right shoulder & left elbow 
*3 broken vertebrae 
*Collapsed lung 
*Nerve damage in left arm resulting in 4 month paralysis 
*PTSD
*Torn rotator cuff 
*Torn bicep tendon 
*Prominent arthritis in left shoulder

Here are some photos of the conveyor belt:

The one I was sitting on when it was turned on: https://i.imgur.com/4aGV5Y2.jpg

I fell down below to this one where I got caught in between the two before I eventually broke my arm, was freed, and ended up being sucked up under that bar where the ribs and back broke before I eventually passed out and lost consciousness from not being able to breathe: https://i.imgur.com/SCGlLIe.jpg

REMEMBER: SAFETY FIRST and LOTO....it saves your life.

I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July of 2015, and classified Stage IV in October of that year.

I had no evidence of disease from January 2016 to April of 2018, when a recurrence was found on my liver. In September I had a liver resection and have been doing more chemo to try and wrap things up, and things seem to be going alright.

Through my journey I've tried adjunctive therapies which I feel were helpful with symptoms if nothing else. I've also worked hard to ease my fear of death and physical disability. I'm happy to talk about most anything! So please feel free to ask.

It's currently completely funded and available for purchase through [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yiayboardgame/yiay-the-board-game?ref=cvr9yz) right now! 

YIAY (Yesterday I Asked You) is the game that settles the debate on who's the funniest in your friend group. Cards provide prompts from 8 different categories, and each category places a different rule on how you have to answer the prompt. It could make you draw, write riddles, rhyme, or even think of slogans. There's different ways to play with your friends and compete to get the most laughs.

I partnered with [Juniper](https://www.junipercreates.com), a Toronto-based studio that specializes in creating custom products for content creators, to bring the game to life, and we've been working on this for almost a year now. We're on Kickstarter to be able to mass manufacture the game and get it into everyone's hands, and also to make a really cool expansion pack while we're at it. 

I'm also going to be hosting a Charity Livestream event on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jacksfilms) on November 21st at 7pm ET, called YIAY Gives Back, with some amazing content creators you know and love. We're going to be playing YIAY: The Board Game to compete for a jackpot to go to the charity of the winner's choosing. All funds donated during the stream will also add to this pot. Join us and help us raise money for a good cause!

On February 27th I left the Pacific Ocean and over the course of the last five months I walked 3,100 miles to the Atlantic Ocean in Boston. I learned a lot about the country, a lot about myself, and a lot about people in general. 

Here's a [five-minute highlight video](https://youtu.be/mJvaYWanm-s) of the walk, if you're into that. Also, I'm putting the finishing edits on the book I wrote about the walk. You can find that at [http://benwalksamerica.com](http://benwalksamerica.com). 

Otherwise, ask me anything. I'll be here all day answering any and everything. 

I'll get out ahead of the questions and answer the most popular question first. 

*Why? Are you raising money for anything? Any charity?*

* My motivation was the adventure. There was no cause associated. I wasn't raising awareness or money for anything. At first I felt a little guilty when people would ask me, but I learned to own it. I was doing it because it was there. To see if I could. Humans have an innate desire to explore and adventure and that's what I was tapping into more than anything. After I started thinking about it, I got worried that one day I'd regret it if I didn't do it. The idea of watching the country evolve ever slowly as I moved eastward at 3 mph, *that* excited me.

More about me - I've been a redditor for 8 years, and a professional comedian for 14. I started doing improv when I was 13 (23 years ago).

I was collegehumor.com's first writer, and last baseball season I was the senior comedy correspondent for Fox Sports. I have done a bunch of TV shows and just filmed a part in my second movie. And I'm the host of [Major League Podcast](http://www.MajorLeaguePodcast.com), where I ask professional baseball players uncomfortable questions like ""What's it like to be traded for a player to be named later?"".

I tour as much as I can, and I produce comedy shows around the states. [Here's free tickets](http://www.comedysupply.com). 

If you want to know what my comedy is like, I have [my latest special on YouTube for free.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ9ByX-oJAM)

7yp3nr,IamA Disabled Little Person who just moved into an apt of my own!!! Wooo! Let's have some fun. AMA!,17894,0.79,1940,2018-02-20 00:33:21,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7yp3nr/iama_disabled_little_person_who_just_moved_into/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7yp3nr/iama_disabled_little_person_who_just_moved_into/,self.IAmA,0,1,,text,True,False,False,"**My short bio:** I did an AMA 2 or 3 years ago which made it to the front page, because we just had fun with it. I was answering for 2 solid days and don't let my photo fool you with the size of my brass cojones, I am actually a little person. Sorry no banana for scale. I am diagnosed technically with rheumatoid arthritis which screwed up my joints pretty badly for many years before biologics like Enbrel went mainstream. I am 34 and got ""sick"" at 3, so in 1986. I am not touchy about answering anything health related or my condition or the occasional inevitable ""how big is your dick?"" questions. Lets have fun. 

Sorry about the quality of my photos, my phone is a potato.

https://imgur.com/a/Mc6p7 Short album of my apt and a hilarious shot of my with a stripper. I was laughing like a moron the entire time because of the awkwardness and ridiculousness of the situation, not because of her nakedness. The Strip club was actually super disappointing. Dark, very loud, most of it wasn't accessible, and the dancing was crap. I could dance better, and it crossed my mind actually getting up on stage. Ask for a ramp and there I am twerking my powerchair's ass off.

Now the problem why I moved on my own into an accessible apt was not only the accessibility which I never had before (I couldn't reach the sink, go outside on my own til I got this incredible powerchair a couple years ago, didn't have an accessible shower, or kitchen, etc) but also because of my parents, particularly my mother. A few years ago I started reading /r/raisedbynarcissists and after years of depression, isolation, tantrums, and a suicide attempt, I found that those stories read exactly like my life. So maybe the problem wasn't in me and I wasn't to blame. Next step was doing something about it. It took years of exercising my arms, anxiety chest pains, weed, months of bureaucracy, and fighting and loathing for me to find this place. Obviously I have a visiting aide, Deb, but the idea here is to do as much as I can on my own. Deb's a hoot though. I was afraid of getting someone with the outlook of a guard from Auschwitz. I was also lucky in that the installer guy agreed to make slight modifications to the apt for my safety, but I went balls deep with the expensive grab bars and touch sensitive Delta faucet (I'm sure you can imagine how much that cost). A few kind Redditors took pity and actually bought me a mechanical toothbrush and gummi bears. I can eat a pound of those when I'm stoned.

Now I will tell you a little bit about the apt. It isn't big, in fact it's quite small, the bedroom is about filled to the brim after the bed was installed. But it's 100% mine and to make it livable I have then, and now planned to make as much of it accessible or automatic as possible. They already have a remote control door which I actually was pleasantly surprised by, and motion sensors on trash and laundry rooms. But inside the apt I had ideas in my head too... Keep in mind I really can't modify the apt, nail things to walls or whatever, but they were kind enough to agree to install my mostly reasonable safety requests. For example I spent a lot of money on a touch sensor faucet. Sorry for the potato quality photo, but I cannot take good selfies with my tiny little Trex arms. I wanted to show the kitchen faucet here. Basically not only can I reach it (a first for me) but it's also very convenient in that you touch any metal part to turn it on/off. The soap dispense is motion sensitive too (though it leaves a lot to be desired as it sucks the soap back as much as it squirts out). The bathroom sink faucet will be motion sensitive and they installed safety for my toilet too  https://i.imgur.com/SlWNY25.jpg and what I lovingly call my Hello Kitty seat https://i.imgur.com/rt0TMce.jpg The trashcans will be motion sensitive and will close because I don't want to be staring at rubbish all day. A very kind Redditor has purchased an Alexa for me which is incredible because not only will I have something smarter than a cat to talk to, I can also ask it to call 911 if I fell on my head and I don't even need one of those emergency buttons. As far as lighting goes, I don't have good ideas. I know I can't nail things to walls, and those stand alone lights piss me off. To me they're like for old people. My crazy idea was to RGB the entire place with hidden Alexa controlled lightstrips. For one I can stick these under bed and have the first ever RGB bed in history (eat your heart out, Corsair), behind couch under my PC table without damaging walls. The wirelessness will be convenient and they will provide light as well as color if I want. This feels like the way to go, but so far I haven't been able to choose a good lightstrip system, and I really don't know how many I will need. Probably at least 4 or 5 strips but I will come up with a plan once I have everything else under control.

Now for the medical part if anyone has questions. I have rheumatoid arthritis since I was 3 as I said, which is autoimmune meaning my immune system is attacking my joints. Unfortunately in Russia in 1986 there wasn't really any way to fight this, most of the meds were had to be self-purchased somewhere. I had Gold from Japan which my grandmother bought. Yes these were used to treat inflammation way back when. I stayed though drastically decreased, the amount or prednisone I take daily all this time. As you can imagine prednisone comes with horrible side effects. Cataract, blood pressure, stomach ulcer, head aches, etc. I used to retain more water than three pregnant women. In about 1999-2000 I started having compression spinal fractures about once or more a month for about 2 years because my body had finally had enough and the osteoporosis is one of the major prednisone side effects. I lost a ton of weight and could eat or even sit up for that matter. I was in pretty much the worst pain you can imagine. Depression set in hard and is still around. Somehow I willed myself to sit up, start eating, and excersising to the limited way I can. Then out of the blue in 2009 I had what was later to be found a mass in my throat so I could barely swallow and even had trouble breathing. Thankfully I found an amazing surgeon in Jefferson, Dr. Boon, who worked his magic and brought me out of it. Got all the nasty out but it took a nightmarish week of precautions, feeding tube, and scoping my throat and two surgeries (was so pretty inside they went in again just for the hell of it.)

I later said I had enough. I got a powerchair, and got the fuck out of that nightmarish hole while the getting was good. I was lucky enough to find an apt and a good visiting aide. My eventual dream is a van like in that album which is a conversion with a ramp so you can sit in the front in your powerchair and drive it. But alas these things are not cheap. I'd be 300 by the time I could afford one. http://imgur.com/gallery/Fq22A

But I unfortunately have to go back to the mixing stage for Crimson Peak, but I would like to leave you with a big invitation to watch The Strain this Sunday on FX at 10 PM which is a return to the myth of the vampire as a brutal parasitic creature that is ruthless and scary and steeped in the darkest parts of mythology and human history. These are not well-groomed guys with 2 little fangs and a six pack. These are not brooding existential tweeners. These things are out to drain you and kill you in a matter of seconds.

a96nj5,IamA 22 year old male who received a living donor liver transplant from my best friend 3 weeks ago and am spending Christmas in the hospital.

Fast forward a few months later after multiple tests and doctor visits, I have cirrhosis of the liver as well as liver cancer.
The docs still aren't sure what caused it, but it was obvious I needed a transplant and there were 2 options. Find a living donor or wait on the UNOS list until a liver becomes available for me (which can take years).

So I set out to find a living donor, and after a few months of searching I finally got a match, my best friend since grade school.

The surgery was now 3 weeks ago and I'm still in the hospital fighting my body against rejection of my new liver. The docs say this is common in younger people because their immune systems are stronger and my body is trying to get rid of this 'foreign object'. 

Im taking massive doses of steroids and immunosuppressants to get my body to accept the new organ but it's a long process. Been at it for 3 weeks now and while my body is coming around, I'll probably be here another week or so.

Keep me company! Ask me anything!

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last weekend that [U.S. unemployment could reach a Depression-level 25%](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/17/powell-unemployment-depression-25-percent-264500). Thousands of small businesses are closed and many will remain shut for good after losing all their revenue. The stock market bottomed out in March but has recovered somewhat since then and is now down about 15% from its pre-virus high point.

What officials are trying to do to save the economy:

* Congress has raced to pass multiple rescue bills totalling around $3 trillion in federal support, but they probably still need to send more aid to state and local governments and extend extra jobless benefits.
* The Trump administration is pushing for a swift economic re-opening, but is mostly leaving the official decision-making up to the states.
* The Fed has taken extraordinary measures to rescue the economy – slashing interest rates to zero, rolling out trillions of dollars in lending programs for financial markets and taking the unprecedented step of bailing out state and city governments.

So what does this mean for the future of the U.S. economy? How will we recover and get people back to work while staying safe and healthy? Ask us anything about the current economy amid the Covid-19 crisis and what lawmakers, the Fed, the Trump administration and other groups are trying to do about it.

The 30 chapters of the deal were officially released a few months ago and it confirmed our fears that this agreement would have longstanding consequences for our digital rights, health, environment, and democracy.  


Although the signing ceremony was really just a formality—for the agreement to go into force, the countries involved still need to ratify the agreement. Each of the twelve TPP countries have differing procedures for doing this, but in the U.S., both houses of Congress needs to vote up or down on the agreement. Although the issues we will be discussing will impact everyone in the countries involved in the TPP, it's especially critical that people in the U.S. learn all they can about this secretive agreement and call on their representatives to vote no to its ratification. That's because the agreement cannot go into force without the United States' legislative approval. 


So we're here today to answer your questions about everything TPP—the secret negotiating process, our analysis of the provisions, and how this agreement is a corporate wish list for big multinational companies. We're here to share what we know about this agreement so you can help us stop it.

There is no way to prove what caused my illness.  The only thing they know for sure is that it was from inhaling a toxin.  This disease is nicknamed Chasing The Dragon Syndrome.  I used to smoke heroin on tinfoil — odds are it was a cutting agent. 

This is my recovery journey from Locked-In Syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma. It is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking.


Everyone thought I was brain dead but I could hear and see the entire time. People thought I would die hundreds of times, but I slowly came back to life. There has never been a recovery like mine from this illness.

**EDIT** Lots of questions about my comment on the rights of workers to run for office.  I won't comment on my company policy but I can say I absolutely felt that I was going to get fired for running for office.  I voluntarily asked permission, and that took over one month.  I finally had enough and by the time it reached that point the wheels had been turning for my Congressional race.  I decided that I would rather stand for my belief than worry about my job.  I don't want special protection, or leave (though many companies do this).  I don't want a guaranteed job if I lose my seat.  I just don't believe you should be afraid to run for office in your free time because you could get fired. I absolutely felt that way.  In many states this is legal, and it does happen.  

You should not have to worry about serving your community.  You shouldn't have to ask for permission to **run** for office.  Holding office is a different story.   

****Ok that is a wrap***** Thank you so much! That was a blast!  One last example of corruption in politics before I go:

This is an email to state delegates in Nevada.  Basically, you sign up to be a delegate, get super excited and then the party sends you an email with an invite and you ""pay"" for your ticket.  You **do not have to pay to vote** and trickery like this is why people hate politics.  Pay to play is terrible, people are tired of it.  

Also...Lots of debate on this in the thread but I stand firm.  You should not be afraid to lose your job if you want to run for office on your own time.  I will fight like hell to make that a nation law.

My personal background:

I’m a millennial father, Native Hawaiian, and third-term state legislator. Growing up, I saw self-serving politicians selling off the rights to our islands, and I knew that change needed to start at home. So at 23, I ran for the State House against a corporate Democrat and a tea-party millionaire incumbent in what was then a Republican district. They outspent me 10-to-1, but I had the people on my side. I won by a whopping 26 percentage points.

And I did it through small donations, organizing volunteers, and personally knocking on 15,000 doors. But getting elected is not enough. Progressives need to fight to create lasting change. During my six years in the legislature, we fought to pass marriage equality, raise the minimum wage, expand the world's largest marine monument, levy stricter gun control, regulate Super Pacs, increase taxes on billionaires and set the nation's first 100% renewable energy goal, and more. Now, I’m taking this energy and record to Congress.

My Congressional campaign is living out the values that mobilized America’s progressive base in 2016--championing Medicare-for-all, tuition-free college, living wages, the right to organize, strike, and bargain, aggressive climate action, a universal job guarantee, gender equity, LGBTQ+ rights, and an end to reckless wars abroad. And, I will do it without a single dollar of corporate PAC or lobbyist money. That’s how you know he’ll never sell out. My values can’t be bought.

Over 2500 small dollar donors have joined our campaign, but we're going to need a lot of help to compete with my corporate opponents. Let's prove that young progressives who think outside the box can bring the change we need. My outro at a candidate forum a few days ago--https://www.facebook.com/VoteKaniela/videos/1807720775938879/

About me:
I was born in a tiny hamlet in the woods of Poland. My stepfather was the village blacksmith and I learned by observing him. When I was 15, I left the village and went to the nearest city to seek a better life.
I found work as a helper at various smithing shops and finished my high school, then the university. Faced with little job opportunities beyond McDonald's, I decided to start a swordmaking operation of my own.

My company, [AudentiaGuild](http://www.audentia.eu), makes highly embellished swords, armour and other metalwork.

I'm 26 now. Took me some time getting there! 

I also teach sword moves on YouTube - some of you might know me as [The Sword's Path](http://youtube.com/TheSwordsPathChannel). My background as a fencer is mainly in HEMA, but I also trained kendo, kenjutsu and sport fencing.

I've done two AmAs here explaining my face transplant and how happy I am to have been given a second chance at a more normal life, rather than looking like Freddy Kruger the rest of my life.

Now comes the negative side of it. While I mentioned before that The Department of Defense covered the cost of the surgery itself and the aftercare at the hospital it was performed at, it was never brought to my attention that any aftercare at any other hospital, was my responsibility. I find it quite hilarious that they would drop a few million into my face, just to put me into thousands of dollars in medical debt later. 

I recently went into rejection in my home state and that's when I found out the harsh reality of it all as seen here 
[Hospital Bill]
(http://imgur.com/w8Ac2sF)

I guess I better start looking into selling one of my testicles, I hear those go for a nice price and I don't need them anyway since medical debt has me by the balls anyway and it will only get worse. 

Ask away at disgruntled face transplant recipient who now feels like a bonafide Guinea Pig to the US Gov.  

$7,000+ may not seem like a lot, but when you were under the impression that everything was going to be covered, it came as quite a shock. Plus it will only get higher as I need labs drawn every month, biopsies taken throughout the year, not to mention rejection of the face typically happens once a year for many face transplant recipients. 

Also here is a website that a lot of my doctors contributed to explaining what facial organ rejection is and also a pic of me in stage 3

EDIT: WHY is the DOD covering face transplants? 

They are covering all face and extremity transplants, most the people in the programs at the various hospitals are civilians. I'm one of the few veterans in the program. I still would have gotten the transplant had I not served. 

These types of surgeries are still experimental, we are pioneering a better future for soldiers and even civilians who may happen to get disfigured or lose a limb, why shouldn't the DoD fully fund their project and the patients involved healthcare when it comes to the experimental surgery. I have personal insurance for all the other bullshit life can throw at me. But I am also taking all the initial risks this new type of procedure has to offer, hopefuly making them safer for the people who may need them one day. You act like I an so ungrateful, yet you have no clue what was discussed in the initial stages. 

Some of you are speaking out of your asses like you know anything about the face and extremity transplant program. 

EDIT #2 I'm not sure why people can't grasp the concept that others and myself are taking all the risks and there are many of them, up to and including death to help medical science and basically pinoneering an amazing procedure. You would think they'd want to keep their investemnts healthy, not mention it's still an experimental surgery. 

I'm nit asking them for free healthcare, but I was expecting them to take care of costs associated to the face transplant. I have insurance to take care of everything else.

And $7k is barely the tip of the iceberg http://fifth.imgur.com/all/  and it will continue to grow.

I had my right amygdala removed along with my right hippocampus and the front (anterior)  half of my right temporal lobe. I had two brain surgeries, one to place probes deep in my brain to record my seizures over 7 days, and the other to remove the parts that were generating seizures.

Among several other less-interesting changes like becoming more talkative and having a worse sense of direction, I noticed that I no longer feel *fear*. That doesn't mean I will calmly walk off of a cliff, just that my reason to not-walk off of a cliff is no longer precisely ""fear."" I am still capable of stress and anxiety, so when I say ""fear"" I am expressing a very specific feeling. I'll post the long story here and it may answer many of your questions:

It's important for me to define ""fear"". We use many other emotional terms interchangeably for feelings that are actually quite different. There is a distinct difference between fear, stress, and anxiety. Are you ""scared"" that you might make the wrong choice (say the wrong thing, buy the wrong product) the same way that you are ""scared"" if someone were to point a gun to your face? In order to discuss the lack of ""fear' let's define those as *different* feelings, not just different *levels* of the same feeling. I'd call the former ""stress"", and the one I lost is the latter. Thus, if someone were to point a gun in my face I wouldn't be chilling. I imagine I would be VERY ""stressed"", like the feeling of ""I just started on the last question of the final exam and I only have 30 seconds left!"", but not ""afraid.""

The biggest way this has presented itself, having not had a gun pointed in my face, is the fear of my inevitable death. I used to have a hyperbolic fear of my inevitable death, but I still would take risks like skydiving. Perhaps it was the control that I wanted. I would think ""I will die one day and there's nothing I can do about it"" every 7 seconds for hours. Now that's completely gone. I am just apathetic about my inevitable death. Perhaps a more relatable example would be cliff-edges? I am able to go much closer to the edge of a cliff than I used to, but if I get too close I still feel that ""make the wrong choice"" feeling, closer to stress/anxiety than the fear I used to feel.

Finally, for those interested, I'll provide a quick rundown of which part does what in the average (right-handed & neurotypical) brain:

**Right amygdala**: Fear, physical response to negative stimuli (including the ""fight or flight"" feeling),  harm avoidance, speech-inhibition (how much you have to want to talk before you start tallking).

**Right temporal lobe**: Recognizing faces, spatial memory (retracing your steps in space, like where you came from and where you put something), verbal intonation, object recognition.

**Right hippocampus:** Forming of episodic memories for the right-hemisphere. e.g. ""\[Who\]  did \[what\] at the \[where\] \[when\] because \[why\]."""

Now that I've graduated, I have more time than I could ever need, so I will be answering every single question. If it gets to a point where over 20 or so people have asked the same question, I'll probably post it here.

I also have a passion for de-stigmatizing therapy, challenging therapeutic cliches, and breaking down barriers to seeking out treatment. Let's chat! AmA!",17472,0.86,1326,2018-09-28 22:21:30,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9jona3/i_am_a_therapist_who_clinically_specializes_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9jona3/i_am_a_therapist_who_clinically_specializes_in/,self.IAmA,0,6,,text,False,False,False,"Hello!

My name is Ryan, but I go by Dr\_Mick in online spaces. I'm a marriage and family therapist in the state of Illinois in the United States. I have a PhD in human development and a MS in marriage and family therapy. I am also an approved supervisor and a clinical lecturer of psychology at a local university.

My clinical specialty includes working with all types of anxiety, with couples, and with clients who play video games. I also write academically about video gaming's impact on individuals and relationships.

I'm passionate about de-stigmatizing therapy, and about challenging assumptions about therapists. Therapists should be approachable and relatable - after all, we are people too!

**Feel free to ask me anything about therapy, finding resources, mental health, video gaming, or whatever else is on your mind! The views expressed in this AmA are my own and do not represent anything other than my own experience.**

Proof: [https://imgur.com/zMG9364](https://imgur.com/zMG9364)

Relatedly - I recently combined my love of video games with my desire to help people find a starting point for accessing mental health resources and support by hosting a Twitch channel titled *\[Game\] Sessions with a Therapist.* Though I cannot ethically provide therapy services on my stream channel, I can (and do) answer general questions, provide general guidance, help find resources, as well as talk about all sorts of things from anxiety to depression to relationship health and more. My goal is to build a community where people can feel supported by me and other viewers, and where they can chat in a space that's more accessible and relatable.

I stream nightly at 11:30pm CDT but also at other random times during the week if I get the time. **If you've ever wanted the opportunity to talk to a therapist in a more casual environment, stop by - I'd love to chat with you!**

Twitch channel: [twitch.tv/drmicklive](https://twitch.tv/drmicklive)

Twitter: [@drmicklive](https://twitter.com/drmicklive)

edit: WOW. This blew up and I am SO grateful that so many are open to talking about this. I'm doing my best to answer questions as fast as I can! Stop by the stream - I'm live right now answering questions verbally as well!

edit 2: this has been absolutely incredible. Seriously. I want to get to every single one of you but you would not believe how swamped my inbox is! be patient with me please! And if you'd like to ask me directly, stop by the stream this evening and every evening at 11:30pm central time! This thread proves that mental health is worth talking about, that it matters, and that having a community and open forum for it is desired and needed!!!

**A final edit: as you can imagine, my inbox is still swamped. It'll take forever for me to respond to each message, so I am going to make this edit to answer a few common-thread questions I've received:**

1. **How do I find a therapist?:** Referrals from friends and family or people you trust are a great start. If those are not available I suggest a resource such as [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com), which can help you narrow your search. If you are looking for affordable counseling, check if there are any nearby universities with sliding scale clinics where you could see a student (btw, there's some preliminary research that suggests there is little variance in outcomes from working with students versus seasoned clinicians). Sliding scale, for those who do not know, is when a therapist adjust their fee based on your gross or net income. Some therapists keep a ""pro bono"" or sliding scale case on their caseload, so it never hurts to ask. Also, many therapists are willing to set up brief, free consultations prior to treatment to see if it will be a good fit on both ends.
2. **How do I get over \[x\] or handle my \[x\]?** This is obviously a case-by-case basis. If you do not currently see a therapist, I would encourage you to seek one out who can properly assess and work with you/tailor therapy to fit your needs. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for anxiety, depression, etc. It takes work, and can be a difficult, yet worthwhile journey that is made easier through the support of a mental health professional. There is NO shame in seeking out a therapist - it is a sign of strength, courage, and vulnerability.
3. **How do I convince \[x\] to go to therapy?**: At the end of the day, unless you're a parent responsible for a minor, you cannot ""force"" a person into therapy. However, I encourage everyone experiencing this issue to take time to listen to the potential shame and vulnerability around the suggestion. Suggesting therapy to a person often brings these feelings up, and they are worthy of listening to. Be supportive, warm, and compassionate, and hear their concerns. That might invite a more effective conversation :)
4. **How do I know if my video gaming is a real problem?** If you believe that it is, I encourage you to find a therapist who indicates that they have familiarity or interest in video gaming/ working with clients who play them. They can do a full assessment for something like Gaming Disorder. Quantity is not part of the criteria for a diagnosis such as that. If you're interested in reading more about my perspective, check out this Op-Ed I wrote for the Chicago Tribune: [**http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html**](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-videogames-disorder-gamers-mental-health-world-health-organization-0629-story.html)
5. **Am I doing this to promote my stream more than talk about mental health?** No. My Twitch channel is the platform that I can share this information through, though. The response has showed me that it's a group of people who have been wanting the space. I'm truly thankful for all of my followers and subscribers, but it's something I would be doing anyway. I truly am passionate about helping people break down their barriers to seeking the help of a therapist. It's something every one of us could use, whether healthy, struggling, or having an experience anywhere in-between.
6. **How do I know which therapist is right for me?** If you are seeking family or couple therapy (or poly therapy for the poly folks out there), a marriage/couple & family therapist is my recommendation. If you're interested in medication, seek out a reputable psychiatrist. You can also seek out social workers, clinical psychologists, or mental health counselors - they all exist to help!
7. **Where can I get a list of Dr. Mick's and others' writings about video gaming?** I don't have my writings aggregated - however, if you join my Twitch channel's Discord channel, I have a thread with my writings as well as other mental health resources. It's also a wonderful community ripe with incredible discussions. Google Scholar is also an excellent resource - make sure you look at the impact factors of journals you find video game/mental health info in - the higher the number, the more reputable.
8. **How do I become a therapist?** In the United States, graduate school is the way to go. Before determining which path, sit down and be honest with yourself about what modality (individual,couple,families) you are interested in working with, what kinds of issues (severe mental illness, psychosis, depression, anxiety, etc.) and in what contexts (agencies, private practice, schools, etc.) because that will dictate which mental health profession is right for you. If you go the MFT route, make sure you attend a COAMFTE-accredited school! There are also online options you can look into if you'd like to learn from home. And there is no age requirement, min or max - plenty of people change careers to become therapists!

Unfortunately, I cannot respond to inquiries for specific therapeutic advice or guidance, as I am bound by an ethical code and state licensure protocols. I will say, that based on the questions I've received, the need for more mental health care, de-stigmatization, and accessibility is totally necessary and will hopefully be welcomed in the coming months and years. De-stigmatizing therapy starts with all of us - if a person is struggling, be compassionate. Avoid playing into the notion that therapy is for the weak. It's for the strong. Many amazing therapists are out there ready and willing to help. And, if you don't feel a connection with your therapist, shop around! It should feel like the right fit.

I'm still working my way through my inbox, and will respond to those who I can over the coming days. If you'd like to ask me directly, join me and an amazingly supportive community at my stream - I'm on (pretty much) every night!

Thank you all for showing how much this matters. Let's keep the conversation going!!"

I've done an AMA around the launch of each of my books since 2012, and here I am again.

I've written several novels, including The Fault in Our Stars and Turtles All the Way Down. Last month, I published [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://bookshop.org/books/the-anthropocene-reviewed-signed-edition/9780525555216). It's my first book of nonfiction--a series of essays reviewing a wide range of topics (from Super Mario Kart to bubonic plague) that is also an attempt to reckon with our strange historical moment, and my personal battle against despair.

Library Journal called the book “essential to the human conversation,"" and the San Francisco Chronicle called it ""a reminder of what it is to feel small and human, in the best possible way."" It was also chosen by Amazon as a best book of the year so far, and debuted at #1 on the NYT bestseller list, all of which meant a lot to me because this book is so different from my previous work and I had no idea if people would like it.

What else? With my brother Hank, I co-created several popular YouTube series, including [Crash Course](http://youtube.com/crashcourse) and the very long-running [vlogbrothers](http://youtube.com/vlogbrothers) channel. Crash Course is used by more than 70 million students a year.

Other things I work on: The [Life's Library Book Club](https://www.lifeslibrarybookclub.com/), an online book club of over 9,000 members that reads together and raises money for charity; a multiyear project with [Partners in Health](http://pih.org/hankandjohn) to support the strengthening of the healthcare system in Sierra Leone; the long-running podcast Dear Hank and John; and the podcast [The Anthropocene Reviewed](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/735466018/the-anthropocene-reviewed), which is where the book got its start.

Lastly, [I did sign all 250,000 copies of the first printing of The Anthropocene Reviewed book](https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/nnwm82/went_to_target_to_shop_for_cleaning_supplies_and/) (which took around 480 hours), so if you get the hardcover U.S. edition, it will be signed--at least as long as supplies last."

6t9s78,IamA 31 year old female with Hydrocephalus. I have had 19 brain surgeries so far and have a valve in my head that controls the flow rate of my spinal fluid. AMA!,17314,0.84,1624,2017-08-12 23:10:28,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6t9s78/iama_31_year_old_female_with_hydrocephalus_i_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6t9s78/iama_31_year_old_female_with_hydrocephalus_i_have/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"**My short bio:** 

I was born with a condition called Hydrocephalus (commonly known as ""water on the brain"") where spinal fluid  builds up in the ventricles of the brain. I have a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) programmable shunt to re-route the excess fluid to organ tissue in my abdomen to be reabsorbed naturally. The ""programmable"" part is a valve in my head (outside of my skull, but under the skin) that can change the flow rate of my spinal fluid using magnets and without invasive surgery. However, my valve is stuck so the next time something goes wrong, I will need surgery again.

I have had this since birth and, due to complications, I have had 19 brain surgeries to date. There will likely be more in the future, but so far I have been surgery free for 5 years. 

I wanted to do this AMA to raise awareness for Hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a common birth defect, but hardly is talked about and does not get the funding for research that it truly needs. 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 births result in Hydrocephalus; that's as common as down syndrome. Despite being a condition that has been acknowledged since 2500 BC, there was no treatment until 1952 AD. People often died of untreated hydrocephalus. Very few advancements have been made since the 1950s.

If you want to find out more, either ask me here or check out the [Hydrocephalus Association](http://www.hydroassoc.org/); it is a great resource.

**My proof:**
Proof was submitted privately, but [here's a picture I will share of my shunt being adjusted!](http://imgur.com/QhzjhxT)

Edit: Wow! I stepped a way for an hour and came back to a flood of wonderful questions! I just grabbed a beer and some pizza and will try to answer each and every one of these. Keep them coming!

Edit 2: This blew up so much! Thank you all for your questions. I'm going to try to keep answering them all but I definitely need a break. 

In the meantime, here are some great resources to find out more about Hydrocephalus:

[The Hydrocephalus Association](http://www.hydroassoc.org/)
[Wikipedia page for Hydrocephalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus)
[VP Shunt Diagram](http://www.spineandneurosurgeryhospitalindia.com/images/ventriculoperitoneal-shunt-for-hydrocephalus.png)

And to answer a couple repeated questions, no, [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BiNE0HQV_mo/maxresdefault.jpg) is not what the valve looks like and I'm not a spokesperson for Valve. It looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DCtgRkrF40) and it sits just outside of my skull and under the skin.

Edit 3: Wow! This blew up bigger than I could have imagined! Thank you so much, everyone. I have a party to go to, so I'm out for the night. I'll try to answer people's questions and PMs and such over the next few days, but there's a lot of them. Sorry if I don't get to yours.

Edit 4: I just want to remind everyone that I'm not a medical professional; just a professional patient. Please keep in mind that my answers are about *my* experiences and should not be taken over the advice of your neurosurgeon. 

To those of you asking about drinking water: When your brain is in distress, your body begins to dump sodium to protect it. If your sodium levels get too low, it's life threatening. To combat that, often doctors will prescribe salt pills and limit water intake. However, if your shunt is working fine, your brain isn't in distress and it's a moot point. Do not alter your water intake because of something you saw here, follow your neurosurgeon's advice. For me, I just hate the taste.

Thank you, everyone, for your responses."

I'm Charlie and last night I was taking part in a night dive off the coast of Bali when I was interrupted by a 7.0 earthquake that occurred on Lombok, the nearest island to Bali. 

After the dive we drove to high ground due to the Indonesian government announcing a tsunami warning which was eventually removed after 90 minutes in the hills. 

The earthquake has resulted it around 100 deaths (and rising) and mass evacuation of the area near it. Just google 'Lombok Earthquake' if you want to read more about it.

[This is me, watching birb & squirrel videos with my cat.](https://imgur.com/a/eDKbOX2).

Hi everyone, my name is Jason and I have ALS. I started showing symptoms in October 2018 and was diagnosed in January 2019.

My symptoms started in my right shoulder. I originally thought that I had pulled a muscle salsa dancing. I lost the use of my right arm by March, my left arm by May, and I started experiencing head drop by July. I slowly lost the ability to walk over the following year, and started using a BiPap machine to assist with my breathing with increasing regularity.. By September 2020 I was having difficulty swallowing or speaking. By November I could no longer stand, swallow, speak, or breathe without the BiPap. I received a tracheostomy in January 2021 and spent three months in the ICU because we couldn't get parts for my home ventilator due to COVID-related shortages.

Over the past year and a half I have had two trach failures, one of which nearly killed me. I have been approved by insurance for 24/7 home nursing coverage but haven't had a fraction of  that due to the nursing shortage. I have also had a couple bouts of pneumonia... because why not?

I am happy to answer any questions you may have about my experience with ALS, living and working with total body paralysis and a ventilator, cats, music, movies, what hypoxia or toxic CO2 build up feels like, or anything else you want to ask.

Cat photos will be provided but you'll have to provide your own refreshments. All I have is feeding tube formula, which is probably pretty gross.

Hello Everyone,

It's been almost exactly a year since my first AMA (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2091d4/iamtimbernersleeiinventedthewww25_years/), and I look forward to joining you once again to see what your hopes and fears are about the future of technology and to answer your questions.

The World Wide Web is now 26 years old, and it's an integral part of the technological boom we're experiencing today. Our connections, our commerce, and our communications have come to depend on it---and those essential tasks can now be performed with a pocket-size device. As the role of technology continues to grow in our lives, we need to take stock of where we're headed. I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia discussing all of these topics and hope you will join me on [wired.com/maketechhuman](http://www.wired.com/tag/maketechhuman)

I'm also the the founding director of the World Wide Web foundation, which you can learn more about on this link: http://webfoundation.org/about/sir-tim-berners-lee/

Looking forward to answering your questions. Victoria will be with me via phone today. AMA!

1. How do you think a comedian's role has changed in the US society? your take on Trump clearly shows that you're rather some kind of a political force than a commentator or comedian otherwise you wouldn't try to intervene like you did with that episode and others (the Government Surveillance episode and many more). And don't get that wrong I think it's badly needed in today's mass media democratic societies.

2. How come that you care so much about the problems of the US democratic system and society? why does one get the notion that you care so passionately about this country that isn't your home country/ is your home country (only) by choice as if it were your home country? 

3. what was it like to meet Edward Snowden? was there anything special about him?

4. how long do you plan to keep Last Week Tonight running, would you like to do anything else like a daily show, stand-up or something like that?

5. do you refer to yourself rather being a US citizen than a citizen of the UK?

**Public Contact Information:**  https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver (thanks to wspaniel)

**Questions from the comments**/**edit**

1.	Can we expect you to pressure Hillary/ Bernie in a similar way like you did with Trump? 
2.	Typically how long does it take to prepare the long segment in each episode? Obviously some take much longer than others (looking at you Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption) but what about episodes such as Donald Drumpf or Net Neutrality?
3.	How many people go into choosing the long segments?
4.	Do you frequently get mail about what the next big crisis in America is?
5.	Is LWT compensated (directly or indirectly) by or for any of the bits on companies/products that you discuss on your show? eg: Bud Lite Lime.
6.	Do you stick so strongly to your claims of ""comedy"" and ""satire"" in the face of accusations of being (or being similar to) a journalist because if you were a journalist you would be bound by a very different set of rules and standards that would restrict your ability to deliver your message?
7.	What keeps you up at night?
8.	Do you feel your show's placement on HBO limits its audience, or enhances it?
9.	Most entertainment has been trending toward shorter and shorter forms, and yet it's your longer-form bits that tend to go viral. Why do you think that is?
10.	How often does Time Warner choose the direction/tone of your show's content?
11.	What benefits do you receive from creating content that are directly in line with Time Warner's political interests?
12.	Do you find any of your reporting to be anything other than ""Gotcha Journalism""?

I’ve been a Marine, a farmer, a public school teacher, a college professor, a county government official, and spent five years as a reporter and then editor of a local newspaper.

As a Marine Corps officer, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace for over 20 years. I aided humanitarian efforts during the Somali Civil War, and I worked with our allies to shape defense plans for the Republic of Korea. My wife Lynn is also a Marine. We retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought Chicken Bristle Farm, a 75-acre farm plot in Lincoln County.

Together we've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I worked as a substitute teacher in the local school district and as a reporter and editor for the Interior Journal, the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

[And we have just been endorsed by Andrew Yang!](https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1263825019530096641)

It’s a big moment, one which represents a significant mile-marker for the White House while adding more fuel onto the already heated congressional debate over whether to impeach the president.

While the special counsel’s work is done, the road ahead still remains unclear.

Let’s help break down where we are in a conversation with three investigators who worked under people who have been in Mueller’s shoes before: Ken Starr, Patrick Fitzgerald and Lawrence Walsh. Their experiences span three-plus decades of recent American history, giving them a unique perspective on what Mueller just completed.

More about us:

**Darren Samuelsohn** is a senior POLITICO reporter originally assigned to the “shenanigans” beat during the 2016 presidential campaign as Democrats scrambled to deal with the hackings later attributed to Russia. He’s been following the Mueller investigation from the beginning.

**Julie Myers Wood** was an Associate Independent Counsel who worked on both the Whitewater and Lewinsky investigations, and was one of writers of the Starr Report submitted to Congress. She has more than 24 years of experience in the public and private sector working on regulatory and enforcement issues from many perspectives, including as compliance consultant, defense counsel, government investigator, federal prosecutor, and Independent Monitor. She’s currently the CEO at Guidepost Solutions, a leading global investigations, compliance, and security firm.

**Randall Samborn** was the spokesman for the Special Counsel investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame’s identity and the resulting prosecution of I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby. He’s a former Assistant U.S. Attorney and Public Information Officer at the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago; 1995-2015). Currently, he has his own communications consulting firm, Randall A. Samborn & Associates LLC.

**John Q. Barrett** was Associate Counsel in the Office of Iran-Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh from 1988-1992. Barrett worked there on various criminal investigations, prosecutions, and legal matters, including cases against Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter, Elliott Abrams, and Caspar W. Weinberger, as liaison to intelligence agencies on national security matters, and on Independent Counsel Walsh’s final report to the court that appointed him. From 1994-1995, Barrett was Counselor to Inspector General Michael R. Bromwich in the U.S. Department of Justice. Currently he’s a law professor at St. John’s University in New York City, where he teaches Constitutional Law, Criminal Procedure, and Legal History.

&#x200B;

In January of 2017 I took the plunge and quit my comfy, corporate front-end web-dev job to attempt to live out my dream of shooting landscape / astro-landscape photos and making & selling prints full time. I had saved up enough money to get me through the first few months, and I already had the large format printer and a (very small and slowly growing) ""following"" for my photography, but I knew I wouldn't be able to survive long with the rent I was paying, so I decided I would live out of [my van](https://i.imgur.com/8Tsjl4o.jpg) as long as necessary in order to make the dream (and the finances) work.

&#x200B;

Proof: [https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PCpusQ9.jpg)

&#x200B;

I share a [shop space](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/8n9li9/working_in_the_print_shop_with_the_garage_door/) (glorified garage) with two other artists, without which this would not have been feasible. It has not been easy, but after almost two years I am still going strong, my business is growing, and I've had some amazing successes such as hanging one of my [hexagon shaped pieces](https://i.imgur.com/Y85vLPy.jpg) in the [entry way to the James Webb Space Telescope Mission Operations Center in Baltimore, Maryland](https://imgur.com/a/GSOtioc). It still amazes me every single day that I get to do this for a living, and although I have a long way to go to be as financially secure as I was with the corporate job, **I have never once, not even on the hardest of days, regretted the decision to pursue this path.**

&#x200B;

In addition to the normal photography and print making, you might also recognize my name from my ""[Glowing Night](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/8y1iyj/dimming_the_lights_in_the_shop/)"" collection of prints which are pretty popular on Reddit. These are astro-landscape photos printed on canvas and then meticulously ""[glow painted](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/9c79x7/dropping_dots_my_friend_scott_glowpainting_one_of/)"" to create pieces of art that are beautiful even after dark.

&#x200B;

As an ex web-developer / designer, I also coded every bit of my [website](http://www.phil.camera/?iama) from scratch, including special features like my Auction page which took me several weeks worth of programming, but which has turned into a large part of my income and has allowed me to grow my following and ship my art all around the world!

&#x200B;

Using all of my skills to build a business based on something I love to do is incredibly satisfying.  Knowing that people from around the world are using software I wrote to purchase art that I  [made by hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/8zwat4/fasthands_makin_stuff_two_days_of_work_distilled/) ... it's a special feeling and an incredible honor to be able to share my art with others and make a living doing so.

&#x200B;

Ask me anything about astro-landscape photography, the trip to NASA, quitting the day job, plans for the future, chasing dreams, living in a van, printing & selling art, or whatever's on your mind. I'll be here until about Noon Pacific time. Thanks Reddit, I wouldn't be here without you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: Hey guys and gals, this has been a boat load of fun but I've got to get back to work for a bit. Please feel free to keep firing the questions and I'll answer as many as I can later this evening. Thanks again Reddit, I love you.

&#x200B;

PS: No, not related to Bill Cosby. No, you can't run in my lobby. And yes, this is classic Schmosby right here.

&#x200B;

Edit 2 - 9/6/2018: Just one more edit. I want to say thank you so much for the Reddit Gold to the two of you who sent it my way! I was up late last night trying to reply to as many comments as possible, and I'll get through even more of them today, and thank you to all the commentors as well. If I don't reply to your specific question by the end of the day today it probably means that it was answered multiple times elsewhere in the thread, so poke around a bit, or feel free to shoot me a pm once my inbox cools off.

&#x200B;

**Regarding photo gear:** A LOT of people have been asking about gear, and I've mostly avoided getting too deep into specific camera / lens / tracker / tripod models, and that is deliberate. ANY modern, full-frame DSLR can take decent astro landscape photos, and while purchasing a more expensive camera body can allow you to take cleaner photos at higher ISO, the best astro-landscape photos are going to rely more on technique than just a good sensor. I personally use an equatorial tracking mount (iOptron's line is fantastic and pretty affordable, but there are others out there as well) to enable very long exposures at low ISO and thus low noise (remember that noise is also caused by long exposure, not just ISO, so this must be kept to a limit also and your sensor quality does play a part), but there's another popular technique that involves taking several almost identical images and then using software to ""stack"" them and greatly reduce noise and increase detail. Check out [http://deepskystacker.free.fr/](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/) for more info on that process.

&#x200B;

That being said, when you're first starting out who cares about a little noise, the magic is just pointing your camera at a dark sky and then seeing the amazing color and light that is actually hidden up there in plain site!  Google the ""Rule of 500"" for a very basic primer of how to shoot the night sky with your existing gear. You will likely have very noisy images, but again, in the beginning, who cares they'll still be cool and it's great practice!

&#x200B;

If you're just getting into astro landscape photography, it's much easier to start with a wide lens (with near infinite DOF), and I'll recommend the budget friendly Samyang 14mm as a great starter lens. They make it for both Canon and Nikon (I believe it also comes under the Rokinon brand but it is the exact same lens.)

&#x200B;

A solid tripod is important, and if you get into using a star tracker you'll want to make sure you purchase a tripod that can hold upwards of 15 - 20 lbs comfortably.

&#x200B;

That's all I have to say about that. Thanks again for reading, everyone. Have a great day, and get out there and shoot tonight while the moon is dark!!"
jk7ybb,"I am a Japanese dude having been a shut-in(aka Hikikomori) for 10 years, currently developing a Hikikomori-themed video game myself for 3 years.

It blew up. I got tons of exposure thanks to this subreddit, which gave me some media coverage, precious opportunity to participate in big gaming events, friendly connections among the game dev community...

So I want to say thank you to all of the viewers and commenters on my last AMA. I've wanted to do this for a long time! ヽ( ´ ∇ ｀ )ノ

In the last AMA, I was asked many times about my daily schedule. Fortunately, I got help from Youtube contents creator Sean. We made a video: [A Day in the Life of a Japanese Hikikomori (Shut In)](https://youtu.be/pu9Ty9fxTHE) Sean made questions and camera plans. I shot myself based on his plan. He edited materials all by himself. So all credits should go to him. Thank you so much Sean and Nami! 😊

 

As the results of the last AMA, I got interviewed by [Kyodo News](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/04/d5183b807f64-feature-what-japans-hikikomori-can-teach-us-about-self-isolation.html)(Japan), [Zeit](https://www.zeit.de/campus/2020-04/haeusliche-isolation-schlafrythmus-sport-hikikomori-coronavirus)(Germany), and recently [Konbini](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=642765539703450)(France).

My game Pull Stay could participate in online gaming event Guerrilla Collective in June, and Tokyo Game Show in September. I believe I couldn't make it to without the exposure from the last AMA.

I got to know some industry talents who have given me a lot of precious advice and exposure. Also, I've got to be involved with Tokyo-based indie game community [Asobu](https://asobu.dev/?lang=en), which has provided me a variety of opportunities and support. They noticed me because users on IAmA gave me a chance.

Everything looks rosy, right? But not 100% true, unfortunately... ヽ( ; ∇ ; )ノ

I haven't still been able to secure my financial situation. This is another topic I was asked about lots in the last AMA. So I'd like to elaborate on it in this post.

When I came back to my hometown from Tokyo, 10 years ago, I didn't have savings much. Probably a few thousands of US$ or less. I lived in this house with my aunt, so I didn't need to pay living costs at all at first. But one year later, she moved to her son's house. I began to receive my living costs from her. I haven't spent money on hobbies and any other unnecessary things. I saved up the rest of the money she gave me. Or simply I didn't want to look on my bank account and recognize my financial dependency. I just ignored that.

Two summers ago, this financial support to me stopped due to the family decision. Since then, I have lived on my savings. As I wrote in the last AMA, I had attempted to become a doujin artist before I started learning game development. I published 2 ""books"" on online doujin stores, which has brought me about 9,000 US$ in total so far. Summarizing up, my bank account had around 18,000 US$ when I started burning my savings.

As of today, scraping up all of my fortune, I have 3,300 US$ which includes the fee from English-Japanese translation gig I did before, and also one-time COVID relief from the Japanese gov. So based on my burning rate, maybe I can survive next January, but can't reach the end of February. Yeah, I'm so stupid and crazy. I know that well man (´・ω・｀)

A couple of months ago, I tried pitching my game to an indie game publisher to stabilize my finance. We had online chat and month-long conversations via email. But it didn't work out at the end of the day. I've been pushed into the corner. Don't starve, people say. But I'm almost seeing this Tim Burton style face of the Death.

You are so tolerant and put up with this poor guy's moan until this end? Well... I have something I'd like to tell you (´・ω・｀)

I'm currently running the [Kickstarter campaign for my game Pull Stay](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1363912222/pull-stay?ref=nwzpno)

My life and future are 300% dependent on this campaign. I would extremely appreciate it if you take the time to check my game. Thank you so much for your kindest support! 🥰

I am 17 years old. When I was eight years old, I found out my parents were getting a divorce. My father, upset witht he divorce, shot me in the right side of my head while I was asleep. He shot and killed my brother Ryan, and then committed suicide. The bullet passed through my head and out my left temple and into my left palm. As a result, I lost my left eye, all the sight in my right eye, my sense of smell, I have depression, and PTSD. After everything that happened, I spent most of my childhood moving from school to school, trying to find a school that would adequately provide my needs as a blind student.

Edit: I have to go to bed, four hours of nonstop answering questions is exhausting. For those of you just now seeing this AMA, feel free to keep asking questions. I will keep answering until this AMA is archived haha. Thank you to everyone who has been so supportive of me.


Edit: Hey everyone! I'm only going to answer questions that haven't been asked before. I've answered probably about 10 different questions a hundred times each. I'm sure if you skim through the comments you will find your answer. Thanks!


Edit: Hey guys, visit /r/blind if you want to ask other blind people questions.




Edit: So I've been thinking of creating a go fund me to raise money for an Xbox1 so I can play video games with everyone who has requested it. I haven't created it yet, and not sure if I will, but I wanted to know everyone's thoughts on the matter? If I did do it, I would only raise the minimum amount possible to pay for the xbox1 and the eq I need. I think I would also use it to start streaming on Twtich; you can do that right? Anyway, let me know what you think via comment or PM. Thanks!

Hello Reddit!

We're some of the people who make Old School RuneScape. Earlier this week our entire game studio (Jagex) began working remotely, so we thought we'd use this time to answer any questions you might have. It'll help keep us sane!

In 2013 Old School RuneScape was released. This was a recreation of RuneScape as it was in 2007. Since then there have been weekly content patches, lots of big expansions, and in 2018 we even ported the game to iOS and Android mobile devices.

You can ask us anything, but we'd request that you visit our Support Centre (https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb) if you have any specific issues about your RuneScape account or things like that.

Thank you for your time! 

Answering your questions today will be...

3c0hcz,Welcome Back!,16694,0.78,4128,2015-07-03 22:55:01,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0hcz/welcome_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0hcz/welcome_back/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"You may have noticed that /r/IAmA was recently set to ""private"" for a short period of time. A full explanation can be found [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/), but the gist of it is that Victoria was unexpectedly let go from Reddit and the admins did not have a good alternative to help conduct AMAs. As a result, our current system will no longer be feasible. 

Chooter (Victoria) was let go as an admin by /u/kn0thing.  She was a pillar of the AMA community and responsible for nearly all of reddit's positive press.  She helped not only IAMA grow, but reddit as a whole.  reddit's culture would not be what it is today without Victoria's efforts over the last several years.

We have taken the day to try to understand how Reddit will seek to replace Victoria, and have unfortunately come to the conclusion that they do not have a plan that we can put our trust in. The admins have refused to provide essential information about arranging and scheduling AMAs with their new 'team.' This does not bode well for future communication between us, and we cannot be sure that everything is being arranged honestly and in accordance with our rules. The information we have requested is essential to ensure that money is not changing hands at any point in the procedure which is necessary for /r/IAmA to remain equal and egalitarian. As a result, we will no longer be working with the admins to put together AMAs. Anyone seeking to schedule an AMA can simply message the moderators or email us at AMAVerify@gmail.com, and we'd be happy to assist and help prepare them for the AMA in any way. We will also be making some future changes to our requirements to cope with Victoria's absence. Most of these will be behind-the-scenes tweaks to how we help arrange AMAs beforehand, but if there are any rule changes we will let you all know in a sticky post.

---

We'd like to take this moment to thank Victoria for all of her work on thousands of AMAs. Her cheerfulness, attitude, work ethic, and so many other attributes made her the perfect person for this job. We mods truly feel that she is irreplaceable. Thanks for everything, /u/Chooter, and we wish you the best of luck going forward.

Thank you all for your patience during this debacle (and for the hundreds of messages of support!), and we hope to have many interesting AMAs for you all in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions in the comments below! Additionally, a former admin has asked to do an AMA about his experiences with Reddit, and you can ask him questions about the inner workings of the site as soon as his AMA goes live [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3c0idl/i_am_dacvak_former_reddit_employee_and_leukemia/).

---

Edit July 5, 2015 - Alexis Ohanian (/u/kn0thing) has been working with us over the weekend to institute new protocols for how reddit, inc. will work with the mods of communities looking to hosts AMAs (including, but limited to r/IAmA). The goal is to create a much more 'hands off' system regarding the scheduling and facilitation of AMAs. He has described the team of existing admins in charge of funneling AMAs to the right mods for scheduling in the interim. This team will be replaced by a full time employee in the future.

He has also described the new team in charge facilitating AMAs and some of their broader objectives concerning integrating talent as consistent posters rather than one off occurrences. This more relates to the site as a whole rather than how /r/IamA functions day to day.  While we're still unhappy with how this transition occurred, it would be unfair for us not to publicly recognize the recent efforts on the part of the site administration to 'make it right'."

Johnson (u/coreygjohnson), Rebecca Woolington (u/rwoolington) and Eli Murray (u/elimurray).

In March, our [Poisoned report](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2021/investigations/lead-factory/), in partnership with Frontline, uncovered how workers at a Tampa lead smelter have been exposed to dangerous levels of the neurotoxin. Hundreds had alarming amounts of the metal in their blood. Many [suffered serious consequences](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2021/investigations/lead-factory/gopher-workers/). Some carried lead home, potentially exposing their kids. (One former employee [is suing](https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/06/02/former-worker-sues-tampa-lead-smelter-over-sons-exposure/) Gopher Resource.)

In [Poisoned Part 2](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2021/investigations/lead-factory/regulators-failures/), we showed how Gopher Resource knew about the lead dust inside its factory. It turned off ventilation features and delayed repairs to broken mechanical systems. For years, regulators were nowhere to be found.

Spurred by our investigation, OSHA [showed up](https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/04/06/federal-osha-regulators-begin-inspection-of-tampa-lead-factory/) and found Gopher willfully exposed workers to high levels of airborne lead and doled out a [$319k fine](https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/09/30/osha-proposes-319000-in-penalties-for-tampa-lead-smelter/) — one of the largest penalties in Florida in recent history. Lead wasn’t the only toxic metal it struggled to contain — the plant also [broke rules on cadmium exposure](https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/09/23/cadmium-spiked-inside-a-tampa-lead-factory-workers-didnt-get-help/).

Recently, we published [Part 3](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2021/investigations/lead-factory/pollution-fallout/): The smelter also threatened the surrounding Tampa community and environment with a pattern of polluting, despite promises to change. Under Gopher’s ownership, the plant released too much lead into the air, polluted local waterways and improperly dumped hazardous waste. Nearby residents worry about potential health effects. One put it simply: “That battery place scares me.”

Ask us anything.

My first AMA was addressing how my story blew up, and the strange place I was in with the news cycle placing attention on myself and my family.

Our distributor is IFC Midnight (the horror division of IFC Films). Blu-ray/DVD distributed by Shout/Scream Factory.

We had a theatrical run in approx 20 cities back in January, but it seems Hulu will be our main source of viewers. The theaters we were in were small indie/arthouse ones.

My name is Mark. I produced for our company Stag Pictures. This is my second horror feature film with the same director (Daniel), writer (Zack), and co-producer (Michael).

We have been actively developing this version of the game, implementing quality of life and content updates which are approved by over 75% of the community. In fact, we are just about to release our first ever quest - **Monkey Madness II** - a sequel to a quest line started over 11 years ago.

We are a bit of an anomaly in the games industry, and the concept of Old School RuneScape can often boggle the minds of onlookers, so we wanted to answer any questions you may have.

I am also currently suing the Department of Defense for records related to NSA's failure to prevent 9/11 despite the fact that we now know it could have.

I am litigating this case with my colleague Matt Topic and the rest of the Transparency Team at Loevy & Loevy.  Matt is best known for being the lead attorney in the Laquan McDonald shooting video case as well as this case.  We have also forced the release of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s “private” emails and countless more police shooting videos in Illinois.

While there are a small number of other attorneys who do this type of work, almost all of them work in-house for organizations.  As far as I am aware we are the only team in the country doing this work at a private firm full-time and representing both major media organizations and regular people.  We are able to represent regular people at no charge because under the Freedom of Information Act when we win a case the government has to pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs.

I gotta go run and take care of some things, but I will try to get to a few more questions later on today.

Hey folks. If you frequent cooking and food science subreddits (such as /r/seriouseats or /r/cooking or /r/askculinary), we’ve probably met. I’m the author of [The Food Lab: Better Home cooking Through Science](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science-ebook/dp/B00TG24C34/), which is a recipe-based good science book for home cooks. I’m also the former culinary director of the website [Serious Eats](http://www.seriouseats.com) and I run a California beer hall in San Mateo CA called [Wursthall](http://www.wursthall.com). I have a children’s book called Every Night is Pizza Night coming out next fall and am working on series of follow-ups to my first book. This September I also joined The New York Times Food team.

Aside from cooking, I’m into playing, writing, and recording music, woodworking, and pretty much anything that involves making stuff with your hands.

I’m here to help answer any holiday cooking questions you may have, or anything else you want to know about recipe-writing, book-writing, helping start and run successful restaurants, cooking with kids, food science, The Beatles, or me. You can follow me on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqJQ_cXSat0KIAVfIfKkVA), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kenjilopezalt/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kenjilopezalt), but nobody's gonna make you do it.

Ask me (almost) anything. Only things I won't answer are personal questions about my family.

It has been almost two years since my last AMA, and I think with all I've had happen in the past little while it would be nice to take some time to come back and chat. The previous AMAs can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1s4l7v/i_am_col_chris_hadfield_retired_astronaut/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dhovl/hi_from_orbit_reddit_i_helped_canada_unveil_its/). If I'm unable to get to your question today, there's a chance that you'll be able to find my responses there.
 
Before our conversation, I’d like to highlight three things that I've been up to recently, as they might be of interest to you.

The first is [Generator](http://www.generatorevent.com/) ([fb event](https://www.facebook.com/events/712627588883618/)). Happening on the 28th (in 5 days) at Toronto's historic Massey Hall, it is a blend of comedy, science and music in the style of Brian Cox and Robin Ince's yearly event at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The intent is to create a space for incredible, esoteric ideas and performers to reach a mainstream audience. For example, Marshall Jones' slam poem [Touchscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFX2LrNE3VI) is undeniably fascinating, but through an uncommon medium that makes seeing it inaccessible. I want Toronto to have a platform where performers can meet a large audience more interested in their message than their medium. It isn’t a show that is easy to describe, but I think it will be one that is memorable. While I wouldn't call it a charity event in the way that term is often used, the proceeds from the show will be going to local non-profits that are making definitive, positive change. If you're in the area, we'd love to have you there. The more people come out, the stronger we can make it in the future. I'm really looking forward to it.
 
The second is my recent album, [Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can](http://chrishadfield.ca/music/), of which I am immensely proud. The vocals and guitar were recorded in my sleeping pod on station, and then later mixed with a complement of talented artists here on Earth. The final music video of the album, from the song Beyond the Terra, will be released in the coming days. My proceeds from the album will be going to support youth music education in Canada.

The third is my upcoming animated science-comedy series, ""It's Not Rocket Science"", which will be a released on YouTube and is aimed at changing the talking points on a number of contentious public views of scientific concepts. For example, encouraging vaccination by explaining smallpox, not vaccines, or explaining climate change via the Aral Sea, rather than CO2. While it is still in production, we have set up a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/notrocketscience?ty=h) to provide background updates to how things are progressing with the talented group making it a reality, as well as helping to cover the costs of keeping it free to view.
 
With that said - ask me anything!"

Our investigations have led to criminal animal cruelty convictions, animal welfare policy reforms at Fortune 500 companies, and even the introduction of federal legislation in Mexico.

We also fight [ag-gag legislation](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/01/opinion/no-more-exposes-in-north-carolina.html?mcubz=0), which criminalizes whistleblowers and investigators who document animal abuse in factory farms.

Lastly, I helped launch [New Crop Capital](http://www.newcropcapital.com) and [The Good Food Institute](http://www.gfi.org), two entities focused on advancing [“clean meat”](http://www.cleanmeat.com) (meat grown in cell culture) and better plant-based foods.

As it is now past 9PM in Geneva, I will have to sign off for now although I may be back to answer a few more questions later.

My name is Meagan Allen, I'm a volunteer with an NGO called Exponential Education in Ghana and I'm here now with some of our students from Ejisu Model Junior Secondary School, Frank, Dzifa, Faustina, Janet, and Aba. Ask us Anything!


Here in Ghana, the education system has many challenges, including an over-reliance on rote learning, lack of funding and resources in general, and under/poorly-trained teachers.


To help counter these challenges, Exponential Education runs various after-school programs, ranging from our flagship Peer-to-Peer Math and English tutoring program, to our Girls Leadership, Empowerment, and Action (LEAP) program, to our Level Up Village (LUV) classes, which focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM).


At Ejisu Model JHS we currently run a [LUV Global Doctors Anatomy](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-doctors-anatomy/) class. The students meet once a week after school to learn about human body systems in a hands-on and interactive way. Through this class, they use scalpels and forceps to dissect and learn, something they would not have the opportunity to do in a regular Ghanaian classroom. We are also running a [Global Inventors](http://www.levelupvillage.com/global-inventors/) class, where they get to learn about 3D printing! The kids are also partnered with a school in another country that they exchange videos with to learn about each other's culture, while also sharing observations about their hands-on classes. 


If you'd like to help support our organization and important programs like these, please visit our donations page [here](http://www.exponentialeducationprogram.org/donate). A small amount can go a long way and any contribution would be greatly appreciated! None of our American staff take salaries and field staff like myself take small living stipends. All of your donations will go towards supporting our programs here on the ground.



I'd also be happy to send donors a thank-you card from the kids, Ghanaian chocolate, locally produced fabrics and crafts, etc. Just PM me your details so we can work out shipping.



If you are interested in learning about our other programs, check out our past AMAs and our various social media:

UPDATE 11/26 4:25 GMT: The kids when need to leave soon, we will get to as many questions as we can. Thanks for your interest!

UPDATE 11/26 5:36 GMT: The kids and Ms. Elsie had to go home for chores and dinner. I will continue to answer remaining questions, but am about to travel from my office to home (dinner time), so I'll get to them soon!

UPDATE 11/26 8:57 GMT: Thanks everyone for your overwhelming interest! There are just too many questions for me to get to tonight. I have to sign off for now, but will get back to questions tomorrow. I will also try to get in touch with the kids for some more answers from them directly.

UPDATE 11/27 5:24 GMT: I'll try to get to more questions tonight and answer what I can without the kids (they are all at home with their families), but I won't be able to take any more questions after that as I have to do regular work tomorrow. Sorry all!

As a quick reminder, as many of you have asked, you can find out more about supporting our organization and programs on our donate page here. ALSO, we are actually prepping for our annual giving campaign for Giving Tuesday, so feel free to share our info with your networks as well: exponentialeducationprogram.org/donate "

You can check it out here if you like: [Jack's Flight Club](https://www.jacksflightclub.co.uk/) 

We're nothing fancy… we basically send our members a note when flights to amazing places go really, reeeeaaaally cheap (like round-trip from UK to Hawaii at £289 cheap) and tell them where to book them before they are all gone. 


In the last 5 months we’ve grown from a tiny membership newsletter of mostly my friends to over 75,000 members and, in the meantime, have saved travellers a ridiculous £500,000 on airfare - which I’m very proud of!


We’ve had stories of members getting to finally see their far-away family, get engaged, go on honeymoons, find new love, and visit places they never thought they could afford. It’s been a VERY hectic 5 months since the last one and I’ve decided to come back and host another AMA to answer any questions about our journey, cheap travel, and offer any advice I can for your next trip!

In conjuction with Giving Tuesday my wife and I have decided to hold our second AMA. Our daughter Lily was born with a rare genetic condition called Zellweger Syndrome. The condition left her blind, mentally retarded, and epileptic. My wife and I became fulltime caregivers for almost five months until Lily ultimately passed.

https://www.lilyslist.org/

In Lily's honor my wife and I founded a Non-profit organization named ""Lily's List"". Our mission is to assist parents and caregivers as they transition home from the hospital. We accomplish this by providing small items that insurance often won't pay for. Our ""love boxes"" make the caregiver's day a little bit more organized and hopefully easier. Below are only a few of the items we include: 


* Specialized surge protector for the numerous monitors and medical equipment


* A whiteboard for tracking medications, seizures, and emergency data


* A wall organizer for random medical equipment 


* Cord wraps for easy transportation

Taylor and I are happy to answer any questions regarding our experience or Lily's List. **No question is off limits. Please do not hold back.**

About half that is direct and half of that is indirect.

I wish to limit all of my suggestions to:

   * things that add luxury and or money to your life (no sacrifices)
   * things that a million people can do (in an apartment or with land) without being angry at bad guys

Whenever I try to share these things that make a real difference, there's always a handful of people that insist that I'm a monster because BP put the blame on the consumer.  And right now BP is laying off 10,000 people due to a drop in petroleum use.  This is what I advocate:  if we can consider ways to live a more luxuriant life with less petroleum, in time the money is taken away from petroleum.

Let's get to it ...

If you live in Montana, switching from electric heat to a rocket mass heater cuts your carbon footprint by **29 tons**.   That as much as parking 7 petroleum fueled cars.

35% of your cabon footprint is tied to your food.  You can eliminate all of that with a big enough garden.  

Switching to an electric car will cut **2 tons**.  

And the biggest of them all:  When you eat an apple put the seeds in your pocket.  Plant the seeds when you see a spot.  An apple a day could cut your carbon footprint **100 tons** per year.

There’s a lot of momentum behind this political movement. Tech companies like Reddit, Mozilla, and Twitter have all signed on to [an open letter](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/05/22/protecting-search-and-browsing-data-from-warrantless-access/) demanding that Congress support common-sense privacy protections.

Hey Reddit! I'm a 911 dispatcher here to welcome your questions, provide insight, and hopefully gain a little visibility for a profession that usually only enters the public eye when we screw up! 

I work in a PSAP (Public Safety Access/Answering Point) meaning that we dispatch for every agency in my county, which includes Fire, EMS, Law Enforcement, and other agencies. My center specifically handles calls and radio dispatch for the County Sheriff, local Police, 10 separate Fire Departments, the Forestry Service, EMS, the local Rescue Squad/independant first responders, State Parks, and Animal Control! 

Ask away!


**********EDIT******************

Thank you, everyone, for your support, your time, and your questions! I have to sign off for a bit, but I promise I will return and try to answer everything that's been asked!

Call us if you need us!

*************EDIT #2************************************************

**Here are answers to some common questions!**

**1) When should I call 911?**

Any time you believe yourself or someone else to be in danger, or if you are in a situation that you cannot handle on your own, please do not hesitate to call! We would always rather you call and we send someone out and it end up being a non-emergency, than you hesitate and something bad happen. Call!

**2) How do I get a job as a dispatcher?**

Our center does not require any kind of degree beyond a high school diploma. I personally just found a job posting on my County's website and applied! The next step is a skills/aptitude test which will test your typing speed (at least 35 words/minute), your reading comprehension, listening skills, and your ability to multitask. If you pass this, then you usually will have a panel interview with several people from the dispatch center, which is honestly just about like every other interview I've ever had. The questions are fairly generic, they're mainly looking for clear communication, and a background in customer service is a plus since that's essentially what you're doing, serving the public. After you get hired, you'll be trained very thoroughly, certified in every area the center requires, and then start your probationary period (mine was six months).

**3) Can you trace a call?**

Yes and no, essentially. 
**Landline calls** will usually give us a reliable physical address. **Cell Phone calls** will usually give us a GPS location on our map that's accurate within about 30 yards. **VOIP calls** function mostly like landline calls on our end, but have less accuracy on average. That said, all of these can and do fail from time to time, so it is always best to tell us your location!

**4) What's the most important information to tell 911 when I call?**

Location! **Location!!** LOCATION!!!!

If we know nothing else, your location will let us send help and we can go from there! Yes, we would love to know what is going on in the situation, but as soon as we get your location we can start sending help, so please tell us that first, and then while someone else is dispatching responders, the call taker will try to get the rest of that information and let the units know as we go

**5) What happens if someone calls and hangs up, or says nothing, or is unable to speak to the dispatcher due to the situation/a dangerous person in the room?**

Every center has different policies about this. For a call where someone calls and just immediately hangs up, my center will still send an officer to check it out because we have the time and resources to do so. Other centers will not send anyone if they don't hear signs of distress. For a call where the call is connected but you don't say anything (called an ""open line""), we will listen as long as we can and try to hear voices or noises that could tell us what's going on, then act accordingly. Do we hear yelling or arguing? Gun shots? A car radio playing like you butt-dialed in the car? 
**For callers who have called and cannot answer questions because there is someone dangerous nearby** We will try to get you to somehow answer yes or no questions if possible, but if you are in that situation and cannot say anything, **try and set the phone down discreetly and just let us listen to what's going on**. We may be able to hear enough to know what's going on, but if no sounds of distress are heard, then again it's up to the center's policy as to whether an officer is sent or not. I wish that every center could send an officer to every open line/hang up call that comes in, but it just isn't feasible even though we will try our best to figure out what is going on.

Here are some SWEET NEW PROJECTS we’re up to:

-We made a third season of the Cyanide & Happiness Show over on [Seeso](https://www.seeso.com/view/series/the-cyanide-happiness-show).

-We’ve been making new animated shorts every week for 3.5 years over at our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ExplosmEntertainment). We just starting doing C&H Minis, and we’re home to a new series called ChannelATE based on our friend [Ryan Hudson’s webcomic](http://www.channelate.com/).

-We created a card game called [Joking Hazard](http://amzn.to/2k0MElV) and people like it for some reason.

-We also make a daily comic at [Explosm.net](http://explosm.net/) that people still read, probably.

Ask us anything, except don’t ask us what our butts look like because we can’t see them. You don’t even need to ask questions, you can just give us compliments. This AMA is in your hands. No pressure.



EDIT Thanks for doing this AMA with us, we'll be periodically answering questions throughout the evening, so keep 'em coming!  "
7nq4m5,"I investigate oil companies that manipulate gasoline and oil prices. I track oil tankers at sea, deal with whistle blowers, research Standard Oil, and have gone undercover at industry conferences. AMA!",15644,0.88,1010,2018-01-03 04:19:31,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7nq4m5/i_investigate_oil_companies_that_manipulate/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7nq4m5/i_investigate_oil_companies_that_manipulate/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"**My short bio:** My name is Cody Rosenfield, I have been investigating oil market manipulation since early 2015. Oil companies use price manipulation to target specific regions and make arguments against environmental protections. For example, oil companies routinely manipulate California oil prices – then claim that it is California’s clean energy rules that force the prices to be so high. My work is to reveal the manipulation and curtail this false argument.

In 2017 I left the organization I spent three years at in order to try and look at other markets besides California. I’ve spent the last 9 months looking at the United States oil markets, and seeing if I could start an organization to focus solely on oil price manipulation issues. The data is incredibly expensive (just buying historical data for a few specific types of crude oil costs nearly $3,000).

I didn't secure funding, and I’m starting a new job in a week that I'm very excited about that has to do with oil/energy issues.

My work was initially focused in California, which is the 3rd largest gasoline market in the world after the United States as a whole, and China.

I was introduced to the work when ExxonMobil’s refinery in Torrance, California suffered a massive explosion in February of 2015. The refinery stayed offline for a year and a half – causing a huge price crisis in California. Californians were paying $1.50 more per gallon of gasoline than the national average. Californians paid billions more at the pump due to the shortage perpetrated by ExxonMobil and their allies. 

ExxonMobil sold the refinery in mid-2016, and the new owner’s CEO stated publicly that he believed ExxonMobil purposely kept the refinery offline.

I was shocked at how little research was going into the issue, and how no law enforcement agency was taking responsibility for trying these cases. There are specific laws/rules by the Federal Trade Commission regarding oil price manipulation, but the FTC has NEVER utilized the rules to try a company. Americans have spent nearly $6 trillion on gasoline since 2000, and there are essentially no regulators paying attention.


I was urged to do this AMA by r/MechanicalKeyboard, after I posted the keyboard that I use to track ships at sea carrying oil. See that post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/7nnizc/i_use_this_to_track_oil_tankers_at_sea_watching/

**NEW PROOF** https://imgur.com/1Pipfbq

**HOW TO GET INVOLVED** A lot of people are asking if they can help out/volunteer in some way. If you're interested, send me a pm, and what you're interested in doing and I will try and respond to everyone.

**UPDATE** Thanks everybody for your interest. I will be answering further questions first thing tomorrow morning. 

**EDIT 9:02 PST** This has grown quite a bit overnight. I'm going to answer some more questions this morning, and I really appreciate everyone's interest.

**COMMON QUESTION**: Lots of people are asking about whether oil companies can charge whatever price they want. This is true only when it comes to sales from oil companies to consumers. A gas station can charge you *any* price it likes. On the other hand there are substantive rules about trades between oil companies, and sales from oil companies *to* gas stations. These wholesale trades are regulated, but the government rarely pursues them. If you want to learn about rules regarding oil product trades, the best place to start is this FTC guide, which shows there are strict rules, but they are rarely enforced: https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/rules/prohibition-energy-market-manipulation-rule/091113mmrguide.pdf

**pbf ceo saying ExxonMobil kept refinery offline** Here is the direct quote from Tom Nimbley, the CEO of PBF Energy on the second quarter 2016 investor call: 

""As I look at Torrance, this is a facility that has somewhat under black clouds for a period of time because Exxon, I personally believe Exxon probably had made decision that they were not going to run a single refinery operation in the state of California.""

Here is the transcript, with full context, from Seeking Alpha:https://seekingalpha.com/article/3993336-pbf-energy-pbf-ceo-tom-nimbley-q2-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single

**FINAL EDIT 1:35 PST 1/3/18** Thank you all for this journey and ongoing conversation. I’ve answered all the questions I’m going to be able to. ***If people are still interested in getting involved, please send me a PM*** – I will try and respond to everyone, and I'll try find a way to connect people to create a strong network. All from across the world are welcome - this issue is prevalent almost everywhere.

To stay up to date on my work, follow me on Twitter, where I will be more active in the coming year. Otherwise, keep an ear and an eye open for gasoline or oil price manipulation in the news, and check it out if you see it. I’ll do my best to post news stories or any updates on the issue. Remember, this is just the beginning.

The new coronavirus has infected more than 127,000 people around the world and the pandemic has caused a lot of worry and alarm.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

There is concern that if too many patients fall ill with pneumonia from the new coronavirus at once, the result could stress our health care system to the breaking point -- and beyond.

I spent most of the last seven years restoring and upgrading it in anticipation of this attempt. 

Prior to the Challenger 2, I also built (and [crashed](http://www.autoblog.com/2010/11/08/video-danny-thompsons-265-mph-mustang-crash-from-inside-the-ca/)--oops) the world's fastest Mustang with Hajek Motorsports. This went better 👍. Feel free to ask me anything.

Hello Interwebs!

I’m the Lead Systems Engineer at Speedtest by Ookla and my team is responsible for the infrastructure that runs Speedtest.net. Our testing network has over 6000 servers in over 200 countries and regions, which means I spend a lot of my time thinking about how to make internet more efficient everywhere around the globe. I recently wrote [this article](https://medium.com/speedtest-by-ookla/engineer-maximizes-internet-speed-story-c3ec0e86f37a) about how I set up my own home network to make my internet upload and download speeds as fast as possible - a lot of people followed up with questions/comments, so I figured why not take this to the big leagues and do an AMA. 
 
Our [website FAQs](http://www.beta.speedtest.net/help) cover a lot of the common questions we tend to see, such as “Is this a good speed?” and “Why is my internet so slow?” I may refer you to that page during the AMA just to save time so we can really get into the weeds of the internet.  
 
Here are some of my favorite topics to nerd out about:
 
- Maximizing internet speeds
- Running a website at scale
- Server hardware design
- Systems orchestration and automation
- Information security
- Ookla the cat
 
But please feel free to ask me anything about internet performance testing, Speedtest, etc.

An adventurous spirit, a passion for flight and the desire to fly around the world.

As president of the Fly With Amelia Foundation, I continue that work by providing grants and flight training scholarships to high school aged girls.

My newest passion project involves working with XTI Aircraft Company to develop the TriFan 600, the world’s first commercially certified vertical takeoff airplane that aims to provide door-to-door travel at the comparable to the speed, range and comfort of a business jet. XTI is also one of the first companies to run an equity crowdfunding campaign so that anyone has the chance to be a part of it.

Hello everyone! I’m Ethan, and my goal for this post is to bring awareness to Pectus Excavatum.  Many people have it (it affects about every 1 of every 300-500 births) but are unaware that they have it and that it can have harmful effects and is relatively easy and safe to treat. I’ll describe it for those who are unaware of what it is, just skip down a couple paragraphs if you’d like.

I’ll be in the hospital for 3 more days including today, so I’ll have plenty of time to answer any and all questions you may have for a 17 year old with Pectus Excavatum! They don’t all have to be about my condition. Feel free to ask me anything!!! I’d especially love to talk about:

Running (I run cross country and track for my high school, I’m hoping this surgery will increase my VO2 Max and help me become a better runner. I’m so close to breaking 5 in the mile, desperately hoping this will get me there)

College basketball tournament (still mad about the UCF game)

Music (I enjoy hip hop/rap music ^^TA13OO ^^AOTY )

Golf, especially Tiger Woods’ comeback [I missed his match with Rory yesterday bc of my surgery :( ]

Trying to stay positive, persevere, and keep a healthy body image when it would be easy to sulk and give up



Now I’ll talk a bit about Pectus Excavatum and my personal experience. 

*It’s not imperative that you read all of it if you don’t want to (I know it’s long), but my goal with all of this is to help at least one person with Pectus Excavatum who needs it.*

My DMs are open to anyone who anyone who wants to discuss this in private. I know I’m only 17 so I’m not extremely wise yet, but I know this is something I can hopefully make a difference with. Thank you!!! :)

—————————————————————

Pectus Excavatum is a relatively common “birth defect” occurring in every 1 in 300-500 people. It occurs when one has a sunken chest caused by a deformity in one’s sternum/chest wall. It is a condition one has since birth, but it gets worse once one hits their growth spurt, during which the Pectus Excavatum grows deeper. The severity of the condition varies from case to case. In the more extreme cases, the dent can push on one’s heart and lungs, causing issues for the person (especially as they grow old and their heart and lungs grow weaker). Pectus Excavatum can also cause back issues and posture issues for some. Many people also seek out surgery for cosmetic reasons. 

The look of one’s Pectus Excavatum can be reduced through different physical exercises, which can take a long time and much effort. The main method of surgical treatment is the Nuss procedure. During this procedure, two incisions are made on both sides of the chest, near the ribs. From there, curved metal bars are inserted into the chest to raise the chest wall and create room for the heart and lungs to function properly. Anywhere from 1 to 3 bars can be inserted depending on the height of the person. 


OK, now for my personal experience. I first noticed something was wrong during my freshman year of high school. I always knew I had a small dent in my chest, but I just assumed it was insignificant and chalked it up to me being skinny and having small pecs. However, during my Physical Education class, I started to see my shirtless classmates in the locker room, and I realized that no one else’s chest looked like mine did. I hit my first big growth spurt between my freshman and sophomore years, which only caused my chest hole to grow deeper. This is when some of my classmates started to point it out to me. [I have some funny stories about this if you’d like to hear :)]  I still just assumed it was a byproduct of being tall and skinny (I was 6”1’ and 130 lbs. at the time). I searched “chest dent” on Google, and that was the first time I discovered what Pectus Excavatum was and realized something may have been wrong. 

About 6 months later, during a yearly physical with my doctor, he noticed my chest and asked me about it. Eventually, this led to him contacting the [Chest Wall Center at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/c/chest-wall). After some breathing tests and an MRI, they determined I needed surgery. They found that my chest dent was not symmetrical and was mainly on the side close to my heart, causing some pressure on my heart, lungs, and liver. 

Yesterday afternoon I went through the surgery and now I’m recovering. My chest is very tight at the moment and it is hard to take deep breaths. Once my body gets used to the bars I will be very much better off, but I need to get adjusted first. I’m on a lot of medicine at the moment (through an IV) and I have to undergo a lot of breathing exercises and some light physical therapy before I can head home in a few days. I’ll be out of school for 2-3 weeks as well because my range of motion will be severely limited and I will not be able to use my arms for anything. 

If you have any questions about Pectus Excavatum, what the surgery is like, what I went through the day of surgery, what I’m doing now to recover, having and removing a catheter, or any other questions, I’d be glad to answer!! Thank you :)"

Even though I know these projects have the best of intentions, I believe they’ll never be able to keep up. The energy it takes to refute bullshit is much greater than the energy to produce it. ^(\[1\])

Instead, I’m trying a different approach. I recently launched this platform for journalism with “open source” fact checking. Journalists can easily annotate their articles with their fact checking so that the readers can verify the **evidence and reasoning** for themselves, whenever they like. The hope is that by making it easy for the best journalists to “show their work”, in a way that’s easily reviewable by readers, they'll stand out from those who have no work to show.  You can [check it out here](https://sourcedfact.com)! 

My name is Yaz Sinan, a programmer out of Toronto who’s been experimenting with building fact checking tools over the last 3 years. In that time I’ve also personally participated in over 500 fact checks. Ask me anything!

[Proof](https://sourcedfact.com/static/images/ama_proof.JPG)

P.S (worth mentioning):

–  this approach only works for journalism covering information based on publicly reviewable evidence. This includes legislation, public government initiatives, whistle blower documents, and scientific data. This isn’t a good fit for journalism based on undocumented sources.

\- This approach doesn’t eliminate bias. One can provide completely accurate facts and still introduce bias by omitting facts that don’t agree with their views. I do think however that helping the accurate provable facts stand out from everything else would still be a meaningful improvement to what we have today.

\- I don’t expect the average reader to click into and explore the evidence for every claim. Just like the average consumer of open source code rarely reads the code. The point though is that it’s out there for anyone who wants to check it, so whoever wants to double check can do so anytime.

\- Our next big project is fact checking the commitments and track records of the Democratic Presidential candidates. DM me if you’re interested in participating!

**Welcome to our AmA! Eric (u/ ShrikeGFX) and Alex (**u/laderexan**) here from Flow Fire Games, ready to answer your questions!**

*We started working on our game Synthetik in 2015, we just wanted to make the best game we could and would want to play ourselves, hoping it would work out somehow.*

*When we ran out of money at the end of 2016 the game was not finished and we tried Kickstarter, which was a big fail, we had no marketing or following. We reduced spending as much as we could and made a few bucks selling tools and art assets for Unreal and Unity engine and kept on developing. In March 2018 the game came out and we were blown away by the reactions. The Feedback was very positive and the game even got covered by big Streamers like Lirik and Sodapoppin! We kept on releasing big updates for the game, and we now have a wonderful, active community!*

&#x200B;

In case you don't know the game:

*SYNTHETIK is an unforgiving shooter rogue-lite in a world overrun by machines. Your main objective is to battle hordes of robotic forces and brutal bosses through the Machine Legion headquarters. With Synthetik we wanted to bring new depth and mechanics to the genre while leaving a lot of freedom for experimentation and different playstyles.It is inspired by the late 90’s Era of games when people put in all the Features they enjoyed against the recent trend of streamlining.*

**Screenshots of the progression** of the game can be found here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ckpVX](https://imgur.com/gallery/ckpVX)If you want to know more about the game, check out **our website**: [https://www.synthetikgame.com](https://www.synthetikgame.com)

**Feel free to ask us anything about the challenges we came across, the game or the new expansion!**

The Icelandic Pirate party got 5% in the last congressional election and are currently polling as the largest party at just over 20%. The amazing thing about that is not only that the Pirate party is the largest political party (by a slim margin) but also that the Independence party which has historically been the largest party by far is only polling at around 20%. The political landscape in Iceland has rarely been as exciting and the possibility for change is real.

Finland has compulsory military service, though women, Jehovah's Witnesses and people from Åland are not required to serve. A civilian service option exists for those who refuse to serve in the military, but this service lasts more than twice as long as the shortest military service. So-called total objectors like me refuse both military and civilian service, which results in a sentence of 173 days. I sent a notice of refusal in late 2015, was sentenced to 173 days in prison in spring 2016 and did my time in Suomenlinna prison, Helsinki, from the 4th of October 2016 to the 25th of March 2017. In addition to my pacifist beliefs, I made my decision to protest against the human rights violations of Finnish conscription: international protectors of human rights such as Amnesty International and the United Nations Human Rights Committee have for a long time demanded that Finland shorten the length of civilian service to match that of military service and that the possibility to be completely exempted from service based on conscience be given to everybody, not just a single religious group - Amnesty even considers Finnish total objectors prisoners of conscience. An individual complaint about my sentence will be lodged to the European Court of Human Rights in the near future. AMA!

adr87y,IamA Former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd AMA!,15204,0.87,1609,2019-01-08 11:23:33,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/adr87y/iama_former_prime_minister_of_australia_kevin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/adr87y/iama_former_prime_minister_of_australia_kevin/,self.IAmA,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"Hi folks,

There’s been a lot of response from around Australia on my calls over recent months for a royal commission into the future ownership and diversity of Australian media – in particular for such a royal commission to examine the abuse of power by the Murdoch media in Australia. I have described the Murdoch media not as a legitimate news organisation but indeed a political party seeking to advance its own commercial and ideological interests. I’ve also described Murdoch as a cancer on democracy, not just in this country, but in the United Kingdom and the United States.

My experience of the Murdoch media is canvassed extensively in the book I’ve recently published entitled Kevin Rudd The PM Years. It deals with the Murdoch medias campaign to destroy the National Broadband Network of fibre optic to the premises in order to advance Murdoch’s commercial interests in protecting the Foxtel cable based entertainment network in Australia. My book also details the vicious nature of Murdoch’s campaign against my government in the 2013 election. Also you may have seen the [attached opinion piece](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/citizen-murdoch-s-critical-grip-on-democracy-20190104-p50pkw.html) I wrote in last Saturdays Fairfax media on what Murdoch may seek to do next in seeking to ingratiate himself with the Labor party prior to the next election.

If you wish to discuss these and any other related matters then Reddit, Ask Me Anything!

I’ll be answering questions this afternoon from 4:30pm to 6pm AEST. That’s 5:30pm to 7pm AEDT. Other times as applicable depending on where in this fair country of ours you happen to live.

\*\*EDIT: G'day folks, I'm now online as promised! So let's get into it.

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT 2: Hi folks, I've been going for two hours now. Thérèse expects me home for dinner. I'll try and get back to the hundreds of questions that have been posted in this session in the days ahead. In the mean time, thank you for your engagement. And on the core question of the Murdoch media, if you're so inclined, please get a hold of my most recent book to get an idea of what it was like dealing with Murdoch while in office - and what should now be done about it. Kind Regards K Rudd.

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT 3: Well folks thanks for the great stack of questions which has come in through this AMA. The theme of the AMA was Murdoch’s impact on the Australian democracy. And that certainly has been a resounding, continuing theme in many of the questions asked of me. And in many of the answers I have given. Again if you want to explore these questions further, I’d encourage you to read on my website the articles I’ve written recently about what to do about Murdoch’s overwhelming political and media power in Australia. The answer to that, in my judgement, lies in a fully empowered royal commission with proper terms of reference with the object of guaranteeing maximum media diversity for Australia’s political future. I’d also encourage you to read volume two of my autobiography which has been released over the last couple of months. You can get it online. Or you can get it at your local book shop. So thanks very much for participating in this AMA. There has been quite a lot of response both directly and through the twitterverse. If you’re interested in particular on Murdoch’s interest in protecting his Foxtel entertainment network in Australia against internet based competitors (like the NBN) then again go to my website and have a look at the News Corporation’s compulsory filings on the NYSE from 2013 to 2017. These repeatedly point to the threat which internet based media businesses represented to the bottom line commercial interest of the Murdoch empire. The fact that Murdoch campaigned so viciously to defeat our government in 2013 and thereby to destroy the NBN as a competitor to Foxtel is underlined by the logic outlined in these compulsory filings.

I wanted a game to help me teach about the Westward Movement in the mid-1800s.  My partner math teachers knew some programming.  We had access to a mainframe computer that did all its communicating via printed text.  The result was the first version of what became the most popular educational computer game of the 1980s and 90s.  I brought the game to the Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation (MECC) when I started work there in 1974.  When personal computers like the Apple II hit the market a few years later, a MECC team converted the game to a version with graphics, animation, pioneer tunes, and some memorable quotes.  A classic was born. 

Thousands of students who played Oregon Trail back then continue to enjoy fond memories of the game as evidenced by its appearance on TV and radio programs, T-shirts, online forums, and in everyday conversation.  I am here to answer your questions about how the game was invented, what the original version was like, what computing was like at the dawn of its use in schools, and my experiences with OT fans.  

I am also interested to hear your stories of how you first encountered the game, what you learned from it, and how it affected you.  You might also share these stories with the Strong Museum of Play (Rochester, NY), home of the World Video Game Hall of Fame, which will soon select games to be enshrined in 2016: http://www.worldvideogamehalloffame.org/nominate

Forty-five years ago I was looking for a way to enliven the teaching of history.  Thanks to the many people who have let us know we were on the right trail!

EDIT: CLOSING REMARKS
I stayed on for 2.5 hours - thanks so much to all of you who wrote expressing your memories of the game and asking questions.  For all those I couldn't get to, you might find this article from a few years ago interesting, telling the story of how OT came to be:

And check above for the Hall of Fame link - we need an educational game to go in!

What did I learn about life from Oregon Trail?
Plan ahead
Be patient
If you persevere, you'll find your green valley.
Even if the water's deep, sometimes you just have to caulk your wagon and head out from shore.

I was born and raised in Colombia and have been a model all my life. In my early career I was a Telenovela (soap opera) star and I competed in beauty pageants. The porn industry has always intrigued and excited me and one day I decided to take the leap. I definitely prefer being a Pornstar over mainstream acting. I love exploring my sexuality and meeting my fans.

This is my second AMA. My schedule is extremely busy leading into games but I will try my best to respond to all of your questions up until then. I will be responding every evening. 
My name is Shannon-Ogbani Abeda and I am an alpine skier representing Eritrea in the upcoming winter Olympic games in Pyeongchang. I was born and raised in Canada however, choose to represent Eritrea in 2011 before I enter the FIS circuit. I’m a 21 year old Computer Science major student and this will be my first participation in the Winter Olympic Games.
If you’d like to follow me on my journey to the games, you can follow me on Instagram.

I understand that some of you may have certain views that do not necessarily reflect with others or myself and I respect that. However, I’d ask that you be civil and respectful with one another. In regards to some of political questions that have been asked, the Olympic Games bring together athletes from a number of nations around the world to compete in sports at a high level regardless of their ethnicity, religion, sex, or for political reasons. Unity is a key foundation of the games. I do not have any political affiliations and I’m certainly not skiing to achieve any political motives. I am going to Pyeongchang to represent Eritrea, its people, and the diaspora. I’m sorry, but I didn’t come here to answer those questions.

Again, I’d like to thank all of you for your questions and positive feedback! I didn’t expect the amount of traction I would be receiving on some of these subreddits. Thank you for your support redditors, it means a lot!!

The general gist is that I was fired from my job, and for anyone who hasn’t been fired, what happens is they schedule a serious meeting and advise you to bring a ‘support person’. I did a bit of research and found out the 'support person' is a legal entitlement. So, for my support person, I spent $200 to hire a clown to come to the meeting and make balloon animals as I was being fired.

Somehow the media got a hold of the story and it got reported on by The BBC (most read story of the day), The Guardian, Fox News, The New York Post The New York Times, Vice and got a bit of attention here on Reddit.

In 2012, I got clean, then had a panic attack and my career ended.

Retiring at age 37 was actually harder than making it to the Big Leagues. I dreamt of being a professional baseball player from a very young age. For 30+ years, my entire life revolved around baseball. When I retired, I felt like my identity and purpose was stripped away from me. I went from having adoring fans screaming my name, the VIP treatment everywhere I went, first-class flights and hotels and being treated like a hero to feeling like a zero. I missed the game, my friends, the camaraderie, life on the go. I had so much time on my hands, it made my sense of worthlessness even greater. I fell into a deep depression and had crippling anxiety. It got so bad I sat in my dark closet with a .357 Magnum aimed at my head, ready to end it all.

There is a huge appetite for dispassionate, clear reporting on this somewhat complicated story, and I've found the engagement from readers so interesting. As many of you will be aware there has been a significant backlash to the conviction led by Catholic news websites worldwide and some of the conservative press here in Australia.

As promised I wanted to provide an update from [yesterday's Apollo AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/huo2l7/im_christian_selig_i_used_to_work_at_apple_and/). 

Long story short I work full time on making an awesome Reddit app for iOS called Apollo people ended up really liking and after over 2 million downloads I've been able to make it into my full time job. I love animals and our local SPCA shelter needed money due to an influx of orphaned kittens in these warm months (dubbed ""kitten season""), made worse by the COVID pandemic and a decrease in adoptions and neutering, so the plan was to donate all my proceeds from the app for the day to the SPCA. So anyone who was interested in the Pro unlock in app could get the it AND support a good cause!

Well yesterday blew away my wildest expectations. Seriously. To be clear I don't even make in the planetary orbit of this on a daily basis, the AMA and support around the fundraiser amplifies it to a crazy extent and a lot of people support the app which is incredible and exactly what I want because this kind of amazing thing happens. I think the large amount of money was due to a lot of people meaning to unlock the Pro/Ultra version of Apollo (it's free download/use) but hadn't got around to it yet, plus [a new icon option](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png) giving existing users a fun thing to unlock and support, and Apollo's grown a lot over the last year with even more people enjoying it, so combined with the AMA and the post in r/Apple it had a lot of eyes on the fundraiser. Which I'm so happy and feel so fortunate for.

**We raised a total of $42,749.29. Forty. Two. Thousand. Dollars.** That's a ton of money, that's like multiple cars. Or put another way, this bag of cat food is $5/pound. I'm sure the SPCA can get a better bulk/charity price than that, so let's say $4/pound. **That's over 10,600 pounds of cat food.** Adult great white sharks weigh around 1,250 pounds. That's the weight of over 8 great white sharks in cat food. 

Here's an image breaking down the figures for how the $42,749 came to be. ($39.6K from sales proceeds, $2.5K direct donations, $600 from responses): https://i.imgur.com/qA0Am8F.png

The previous record for donations in a single day to the Nova Scotia SPCA was coincidentally $27,355 [from our fundraiser last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cg18r3/update_on_yesterdays_apollo_spca_fundraiser_ama/)! I so desperately wanted to beat that this year and we crushed it by over 50%! I'm now in the process of logistically figuring out how to transfer this much money over to them as cheaply as possible without losing much to credit card fees and whatnot, but as evidenced from the [SPCA Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NSSPCA) you can verify that the money will reach them, given their trust in me and the donations we've made in previous years. Speaking of which, the first year we raised $5,087 the first year, $27,355 the second year, and $42,749 this year (third year) which brings us to a lifetime total of $75,099. What a beautiful number to end up on this year, I'm really hoping we can pass $100,000 one day!

Anyway, thank you so much for your support. I'll stick around to answer some more questions if anyone has any (I tried to answer every single one from yesterday), but other than that I'm going to get back to trying to build the best Reddit app on earth! If you're interested in a free Reddit app as an alternative to the official app that has a serious focus on being fast to use and sleek with an amazing media viewer, I'd love for you to check it out! https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575

My name is JizzBgone and I am unofficially done working at the adult store. I haven't quit just yet, because I have some workers compensation stuff to deal with. I am also a male! 


[Here is an idea of what the arcade looks like](https://gyazo.com/7f2d038a1131cdb78f334486e625ad76)

* What kind of store did I work at? The kind that has a **video arcade**

What is a video arcade? It's a place that has [this kind of stuff on the ground](https://gyazo.com/71ed3d4c367408acf439fca6b8304bfe).


[Oh, and this too](https://gyazo.com/ed2e0864016584e6649e6134090ef6ae)

It was a place that had video booths. Customers would be a small fee to enter, and that fee also counted towards their time to use in whichever booth they wanted to use. These booths were not always used to watch videos. On the daily, it would sound like someone was watching a video with the volume all the way up, *except a video wasn't playing*. So, maybe the customers wanted to be the actors for a change. 


Regardless, it was disgusting. It was also income though.. I needed the money. But now I am getting paid for some time off and to go see a psychologist. 


**Why did I finally leave?** Well, I was sexually assaulted back in September and I finally reported in the middle of March. Was it too late? Maybe.. 


**Will anything be done about it?** Probably not. I have been told that it is too sketchy for my HR and workers comp. to compensate me for my time off. I was told I was going to be compensated, but so far I haven't been. Oh well.. I would much rather be out of there than scrubbing booths by day and crying my eyes out by night. It was a tough 9 months to endure. I needed to do it though.  I couldn't really find a job anywhere with me being a felon. Not even fast food! 

I am in debt a good amount. But let me tell you, the amount of stress and psychological damage is not worth convincing myself every day to go back to work and deal with what happens back in that arcade. 

Back to the job hunt... 
**My Proof:** 

I can't really post the proof, so hopefully the mods verification will be enough for all of you guys. Those pictures I posted above can also help my proof. But, with me not being gone just yet, I can say only so much about the workplace I worked at. 

Ask me anything though! New stories, old stories, or the reasons I worked there! Sex advice, dating advice. You name it! I'm here to talk and I'm here for a while. Last time I made sure to reply to **EVERY SINGLE COMMENT** that I read. So hopefully, I can do that here too!

I’m here with the 100 years young, Berisford “Shep” Shepherd. There is so much to say about this wonderful man, but this quick bio will have to do. 
“Mr. Berisford “Shep” Shepherd is an arranger, composer, drummer, trombonist, contractor, and
singer. Born in Honduras in 1917, and raised in Philadelphia, he attended Jules E. Mastbaum Area
Conservatory and Vocational School where he was being groomed to play percussion in the
Philadelphia Orchestra. Shep served four years in the army composing, arranging, conducting,
and playing trombone. After his service, he settled in New York City where he played and
contracted for Broadway shows. Shep has performed and written for seminal figures such as
Benny Carter, Cy Oliver, Artie Shaw, Patti Page, Lionel Hampton, and Lena Horne among
others. Because of the high-demand for his arrangements, the catchphrase “Get Shep” became
common among New York musicians. He toured with various Broadway shows while based in
New York. One of these shows led to San Francisco, where he eventually settled and was the
house drummer at Finocchio’s for 23 years. Shep moved down to South Orange County in 2007
where he met his wife, Joy. She and Shep currently reside in San Clemente, California”
Here’s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkT3saLNNig) of him singing at 99 years old.
He’s got a [concert](https://www.saddleback.edu/news/arts/saddleback-big-band-shep-shepherd) this Friday singing with the Saddleback College Big Band in Mission Viejo, CA. 
Ask him anything!

Edit: Shep is going to rehearse with the band, but he will be back to answer more questions! If you guys have any questions about his upcoming concert, I'll be more than happy to answer them!

Edit 2: Shep is back!

Edit 3: Sorry guys, Shep has got to head home. Thanks so much for the questions! Hope to see you guys at the concert! Here’s a [video](http://ch39.saddleback.edu/vod/2353-High-v1.mp4) of him being interviewed by Saddleback College’s jazz director, Joey Sellers, in case you wanted to know more about him."

I did an AMA on r/vegan last week and that went well so it was suggested I do one here.

We believe that great vegan cheese is the final frontier of this plant-based/clean foods movement. We have seen lab-grown meat and fat but very few dairy products. This is because dairy and especially cheese is one of those foods that is actually very very complicated and very unique in its structure and components. This makes it very difficult to mimic with purely plant-based ingredients which is why vegan hard cheeses are not great.

So we are taking the essential dairy proteins that give all the traits of dairy cheese that we love (texture, flavour, behaviour etc) and using microbes instead of a cow to produce them. We are then adding plant-based fats and sugars and making amazing tasting cheese without any animals :)

My reporting led to radar finding a [paupers cemetery](https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/25/buried-as-paupers-then-forgotten-their-resting-place-became-king-high/) under a Tampa high school. Records show there could be a cemetery [lost within another](https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/11/college-hill-might-be-a-cemetery-lost-within-another-cemetery/) Tampa cemetery, a cemetery hidden under an [empty lot](https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/12/13/records-say-a-cemetery-in-clearwater-was-moved-the-naacp-wants-to-be-sure/) in Clearwater, a cemetery under [MacDill Air Force Base](https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2019/11/20/records-indicate-a-forgotten-black-cemetery-might-lie-beneath-macdill-air-force-base/). A [history museum's staffers](https://www.tampabay.com/news/hernando/2019/12/12/hernando-museum-is-haunted-staff-says-now-theyre-looking-for-a-cemetery-there/) are among people looking into hunches.

In late October, historians predicted more would be found. [**They're right**](http://tampabay.com/zion).

My name is Damien Mander, IAPF founder, AMA!",14669,0.83,807,2018-11-27 20:42:56,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0vpd6/im_a_former_navy_diver_and_special_operations/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0vpd6/im_a_former_navy_diver_and_special_operations/,self.IAmA,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Thank you all for an amazing marathon session. There is some really good dialog and information within this thread for any latecomers. All up with matched funding we have managed to raise almost US$25,000. This will go towards expanding our operations and hiring more rangers. Thank you all so much. From Zimbabwe, signing out, Damien 

&#x200B;

# My journey:

I began my career in the Australian Royal Navy and later worked as a special operations sniper in the Australian Defense Force. I then moved on to the private sector in Iraq, where I was training men who, faced with the harsh reality of the front line, would either desert, join the militia or be killed.

On a trip to Southern Africa, I was shocked at the continuous slaughter of rhinos and elephants. Populations of these beautiful animals were suffering a 40% loss, mostly due to poaching for illegal ivory trade.

Inspired by this I founded the [International Anti-Poaching Foundation](https://www.iapf.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to defending at-risk wildlife.

# Some context:

Back in 2014, thanks to your help [we made history with an AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/28q6rs/im_a_former_special_operations_sniper_who_uses_my/). We raised money to support the front lines of the war against Rhino poaching.

This was along the South African/Mozambique border, where a third of the worlds rhino’s live. In the coming months, we were able to reduce incursions of rhino poachers through our area of operation and into the largest rhino population on earth by over 90%.

**A great joint effort which we are, and you should be proud of. Thank you.**

While this was an invaluable weapon in our battle, a direct war on poaching is only part of the equation needed to help protect these endangered species in the longterm.

# We learned something important:

**In order to sustain conservation efforts successfully, you need to win the hearts and minds of the local community.**

This realization led us to create a very special project: Akashinga…

Akashinga (meaning the ‘Brave Ones’) is an all-female ranger unit patrolling, conducting raids and arrests on known poachers, and helping to protect an area of  230,000 acres. They work with the local community to prevent wildlife crime, and watch over the growing wildlife populations of the lower Zambezi region of Zimbabwe.

You can find out more about how the [Akashinga team did this in this Imgur album.](https://imgur.com/a/G18Q0vM)

**But here’s what’s even more incredible about Akashinga’s members...**

All the ranger women have troubled pasts. They were all either survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, single mothers, abandoned wives, or are AIDS orphans.

These women are heroes, and have been recognized as such by the Zimbabwe International Women’s Awards 2018 and celebrated on [60 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7EXoU2xgo&feature=youtu.be) and [BBC World News.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAmQLQwF_BE&feature=youtu.be)

# Our goal and how you can help...

We need to hire more women and create a new task force to patrol this reserve! (You guys can name it!) We have several donors willing to match your donations up to $35,000 during this AMA to make this task force happen!

**If you’re able to donate $25 or more to help these incredible women protect these beautiful endangered animals, we’ll send you a pack of these** [**sweet limited edition IAPF/Reddit stickers as a token of thanks for your support.**](https://imgur.com/a/XIpZUey)

**You can donate here:** [**https://www.iapf.org/reddit/**](https://www.iapf.org/reddit/)

More importantly, you’ll also know that your generosity has helped make a difference to both a community of women fighting to regain their independence and dignity, and also to the rhinos and elephants who are being illegally poached.

# Also joining me...

**For our AMA today I will be joined by** [**Nyaradzo Hoto.**](https://imgur.com/fVFD7un) **Nyaradzo helps lead Akashinga operations. She is a divorced 26-year old woman from Hurungwe. She has a 6-year old daughter, Tariro.**

My story.",14654,0.88,479,2019-08-05 00:37:12,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cm06ze/iama_female_born_with_failing_kidneys_a_solid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cm06ze/iama_female_born_with_failing_kidneys_a_solid/,self.IAmA,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Hi all. My name is Amanda and here is my story. I was born in 1990 and all seemed well until I fell very sick. Here is my story. In 1992 I ended up needing a kidney transplant from my mother due to interstitial nephritis. My Kidneys were not functioning properly and my mom got tested for compatibility. She ended up being a 5/6 which was good news! Parents are typically about a 3/6. The local hospital we had been staying at couldn’t handle the transplant in 1992 and sent us to Children’s Mercy West in Kansas City. I was their first transplant on a baby. The human body really is quite fascinating! As an adult, my mother’s kidney was adult sized and I was a small, petite and sickly two year old. After being transplanted into my body her kidney shrank back down and then regrew again through all of it’s stages with me. We were told it would work for approximately three years. Medicines were pretty harsh and Prograf and Cellcept weren’t around. It ended up working for 16 years because I am half made of kryptonite and plain awesome. Jokes! Note: they attempted to actually do this surgery three times. One time they opened her up, I sneezed and they called it off. Third time was the charm. Anyways, it worked 16 years.

That put me summertime, right before my senior year it failed. My dad and mom decided my dad would be my donor so my two elder siblings didn’t have to be tested nor worry about donating a kidney. That man and idol half killed himself to donate his kidney to me. They put him through a million tests. One was blood sugars. He knew he was diabetic but also knew I had to have a kidney. At the hospital they gave him a sugary drink and then he had to drink it there and come back in an hour to test his levels. This was for his safety to donate which wasn’t his priority. After drinking the drink he left the hospital and stuck his fingers down his throat and forced himself to purge the “drink”.. literally popped a blood vessel in his eye. It was snowing heavily out so he walked six miles and started shoveling random driveways around the hospital for an hour to make sure he would pass. He did. Also lost about thirty pounds that the doctors said he would need to lose to donate. He wasn’t obese or anything but slightly heavier than the “average” on their charts. They had checked if we were a match and we were a 3/6.. typical parental match with zero antibodies. They scheduled a date for the transplant and we drove down the night before to check in and stay the night. 6AM came early and I hadn’t eaten in forever but hey, I was gaining a healthy kidney. The nurse came in and said that she had to draw both our blood samples one last time before surgery. We had done it already like ten times over the last six months so wasn’t a big deal. The nurse said it was just to double check that I have no antibodies against him. I asked what were the chances that I would develop them overnight.. she said in the 25 years she had been there she had never seen it. 

Well, you guessed it. I had developed antibodies against my dad overnight since they had taken our blood the night before and he could no longer donate. It meant I would reject his kidney and it simply was no longer an option. Not often had I seen my dad cry but that was one of them. I did too. My high school friends had decorated the house for me to come home too so my mom quickly sent them a text and they ran over and undecorated the house. This meant my siblings would have to be tested. I will never forget the night before my college freshman brother’s lab draw. We spent most of the evening pacing the kitchen and living room floor. He asked me probably 100 plus questions about what it would be like. Genuinely terrified of something I did once a month my whole life and weekly during certain spurts. Take this in your pocket to remind yourself that just because someone’s fear may be silly or insignificant to you does not make their problem any less real or scary to them. Always show comfort and understanding the way you want it when you feel scared. Life hurdles simply are not a competition. My sister tested from Florida where she lived with her husband, she was five years older than myself. I went with my brother and he survived his testing bravely. The results showed I had antibodies against my brother but not my sister. They were both a 6/6 in match but my brother’s would be rejected. That meant my sister was the lucky winner. She graciously donated her kidney to me and I still have it to this day at 29 years old. It is quite the trooper. 

Now. Why you are really here. It started in the 8th grade. I had started my period but I did not know it. Over the course of six months I was in excruciating pain, constantly throwing up and my general health was spiraling downward. Finally after six months they saw my uterus was absolutely huge and swollen with six months of period blood. They life watched me due to the poisoning and toxic shock I was ill with. At Children’s Mercy I met the witch of a woman female gyno doctor. She believed that I had a thick hymen. They put me under anesthesia and when I woke my whole family was crying. I did not have a thick hymen, I had vaginal agenesis. We did not know this because naturally I wasn’t sexually active at that age and the outer appearance of my vagina looked completely normal. There were two surgeons in the US that either could or would be able to do my surgery.. maybe because my previous health issues. I am not sure. We traveled to the one and she turned me down. She had done the surgery once before on an 18 year old female who then committed suicide because the physical therapy required was too much. She would not do it on an eight grader, I wouldn’t be mature enough to handle it. Despite having to grow up much earlier in life from my other health issues. We went and saw doctor two.

He was one of the sweetest and most respectful doctors I had ever met. He agreed to do the surgery and advised that I not tell anyone what I was going through. He said in eighth grade your best friend today may not be tomorrow and that kids could make my life complete hell over something like this. I listened. I didn’t tell a soul. My vagina was almost entirely solid. He ordered dilators that I would have to use to stretch the skin up and open inside the vaginal canal. He asked if I was ready and said no one would be able to do it for me or make me do it. He said that if I ever wanted to eventually have my own children I would have to do this. I absolutely have always dreamed of being a mother and so I did it. Twenty minutes, twice daily for five years. They were so incredibly painful that there aren’t really any words. It was like putting a plug into an outlet with no holes because the dilators had to be bigger than what fit as to stretch the canal. Interesting fact. I had to buy an exercise bicycle because the angle of the seat would help me closely create the natural angle of a woman’s vagina. All a lot to think about secretly as an 8th grader. I did my “sticks”, I preferred to call them sticks, for two years until I was a sophomore. At that point I had stretched the vagina canal skin up and open enough that they could do the surgery. They opened it and lay the skin at the top of the vagina like a natural vaginal canal. 

I sat up in bed after surgery and blood gushed out of me. It was insane. It sounded like when you turn your bathtub faucet on to fill the tub. So much blood. Black and smelling of death. The six months of period blood from two years prior could finally exit. I was so stoked to have my period like all my friends. I worked damn hard to be able to use those tampons. My mom and I went out and bought practically every brand of tampon and pad there was.. plum giddy. I had to continue to do the dilators for three years further so it wouldn’t close back down. Still twenty minutes, twice daily. The longest 40 minutes a day of those five years. I remember my junior year and there was this handsome fella I had my eye on. We started dating and I could tell hands were getting adventurous. I am not sure what normally goes through one’s mind then. I was thinking. Oh my goodness!!! I hope it works, I hope it works, I hope it works. Will it feel different? Will he notice? Will it hurt? Well I was his first finger to vagina experience so what the hell I was worried about.. I don’t really know. He wouldn’t have known if I was different. It did indeed work. Not on the orgasmic scale but it was a tunnel and fingers could enter and I was so fucking proud. Can you imagine if I had listened to the first surgeon and waited until 18 or older? That make out session would have turned incredibly awkward on a whole other level.

Fast forward to 2010.. aged 20.

I am dating guy that was mentioned above after we separated when he went off to college and I had a year of high school left. I just moved to be in the same town as him and signed to start cosmetology school in four weeks. We took an eight day vacation to Disney and universal. I was hurting in my abdomen and throwing up randomly. Maybe like twice a day. Not constantly but something felt off. At the end of each day I would throw up and my feet were SO incredibly swollen that clear liquid was leaking out my toe nail beds. I knew I had chronic pain from adhesions from many surgeries and the many meds I took made me nauseous many times than not. Plus I was so focused on making sure my main squeeze was having the vacation of his life. I was determined not to let me be what ruined it for us. We get home and I go to my routine kidney appointment. He pushes on my abdomen and tells me I am not going home. When I would lay flat my stomach was uneven. The right side was raised higher than the left. After surgery they ended up removing a nine pound tumor that had engulfed my ovary. I had no clue I was basically full term pregnant. I will admit Reddit. This one got me. Knocked me down into a dark place. They had removed my left ovary a few years prior due to being damaged from the six months of period blood that had been sitting in my uterus and Fallopian tubes. This meant that I had done those horrible sticks for five years, hand built my own vagina, all so I could have my own kids one day. After a routine appt and a four hour surgery it was just gone. Ended up being ovarian cancer and am all clear and fine today. 

Current life: I have been with said man above for 10 years, married since 2012. We are foster parents to an amazing girl we got at three weeks old. We were wrote and asked to adopt this little girl by an entire extended family. From May 2018 until March 2019 we thought we were adopting this little girl. A bio relative has changed their mind after foster daughter living with us 18 months. Now we find ourselves in and out of court battling for her. Won’t give any details of the case or share pictures of kiddo. Only time will tell what path we go forward on. One thing is for certain. My husband is a lucky man, after all, he has a one of a kind, hand made vagina. 😉🤷🏼‍♀️😜

Abdominal Scars and tumor picture: RIP my bellybutton. [Viewer Discretion ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bXrzXCG) AMA!

TL;DR Had two kidney transplants, vaginal agenesis and ovarian cancer.

Edit** I did tell my first person of the vaginal agenesis when I went to college. Not sure how to explain disappearing everyday twenty minutes, twice a day to a roommate. Just seemed easier to tell the truth and she was a person I trusted dearly. Been a best friend since the third grade. Started with telling her.

Edit 2) During the two years before they opened the canal, what happened with the blood and my period? Duh. Great question. The doctors believed that if I did depo provera, a birth control shot, every month that I would no longer have a period. The shot was normally given every three months. I went every month because it was critical that I wasn’t ovulating. The doctors also believed that while stopping the blood from continuing and with the shot would allow the blood to re-absorb back into my body basically. This didn’t work. That was discovered after the sophomore surgery when I sat up and the blood that had been there two years came out. My health suffered greatly and my coloring was sickly during those two years. I have no idea how I lived with it in my uterus chillin that long.

I am Lisa Fletcher, an investigative reporter for ABC 7 in Washington, D.C. Earlier this year, I broke the story about the drug pentobarbital being found in some pet food.  Pentobarbital is most commonly used to euthanize dogs, cats and some horses. 

During our investigation, we worked with an analytical lab that specializes in testing food for contaminants. After months of tests and re-tests, one brand repeatedly came back positive for pentobarbital. That brand was Gravy Train, which is made by Big Heart Pet Foods and owned by Smucker’s.  

[Our story prompted an FDA investigation](https://wjla.com/features/7-on-your-side/fda-to-investigate-after-abc7-exposes-euthanasia-drug-in-dog-food) and resulted in more than 100 million cans of pet food being recalled. Ultimately, four brands made by Big Heart/Smuckers —  Kibbles'n Bits, Gravy Train, Skippy and Ol' Roy  —  were pulled from shelves.

Larsen was fine but we were mad as hell - and couldn't stop talking about litter. 

We couldn’t find much relevant information about the litter in our neighborhood, so we decided to become experts ourselves. We started by tracking how much litter we picked up on each street and sharing that information with the community, hoping to raise awareness and encourage action. 

Since then, we’ve fully committed to cleaner streets. We moved to one of the dirtiest cities in the US - San Francisco - and launched an iOS app, [Rubbish](https://www.rubbish.love/), that lets us track the litter. We created a [smart litter picker-upper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ9crcWoqqc) that automatically tracks what's being picked up. Rubbish conducted San Francisco’s longest and [largest litter studies](https://medium.com/rubbish-love/130-000-reasons-why-data-science-can-help-clean-up-san-francisco-6412eba1e374), made to the top of r/pics with the 8,000 cigarettes we collected off the streets (we kept them our porch for a month before we sent it to be recycled) and used data to [cut litter by 47%](https://www.rubbish.love/2019/03/04/a-polk-street-love-story/) in some neighborhoods.

7s3ao8,I was involved in the Kids For Cash scandal which made headlines nationally and is in a documentary on Netflix.

I was one of those kids.

The juvenile judge worked closely with schools and police to have a zero tolerance system for juveniles.

The County run detention center was closed down due to the work of these judges and this property owner. A private detention center was built and the judges were offered kickbacks for sending kids there since the privately run detention center was paid for having the kids. (Through CYS or some form of the government, I'm not sure)

My first offense was when I was 14. My mom and I had gotten into an argument and I wanted to ""run away"". She stood in front of the door and I pushed her out of the way and left. Took a walk in the woods and came back home to find the police. She called them because I left. She just wanted help finding me, but they arrested me. Simple assault for pushing her.
I was put away for 6 months. My mom called everyone she could and somehow managed to get me out. 

My second and final juvenile offense was when I was 15. I was in school playing with some ketchup packets or something equally as childish. One of the cafeteria aids came over and began yelling at me. I was a cocky little teenager and I made up some story about my dad being someone important and told her she would lose her job. I ran my finger across my throat when I told her this.
The rest of the day went by and I was called down to the office just before dismissal. My mom was there and a police officer came. They all went into the office and I assumed the school was trying to scare me...
I was arrested and sent to the detention center. The judge told me I was charged with terroristic threats for threatening to kill the cafeteria aid. I was sent away for a little over two years.

There were no defense attorneys into he courtrooms. Only the judge and the children. We all knew he was very strict since he had visited our schools many times and talked to us about crimes and how he would have zero tolerance. 
I had no idea at the time that anything was wrong with the system. Every kid just thought it was normal. 
About a year after I was released the situation was exposed and investigated. The judges were arrested and the children were part of a class action lawsuit.

I spent a year and half of my high school years getting a very dulled down education consisting of multiplication tables and learning middle school level history. I was between 50 and 200 miles away from my family and because of this I went months without visits. I got a phone call once every few days if I was lucky. I was housed with kids who had gun charges, drug charges, and attempted murder charges. I was borderline abused by staff members.
The class action settlement was about $20,000, which I don't know if that made up for everything.

Proof: https://imgur.com/gallery/Y35F4

EDIT: documentary is here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpNynnYwC0

Ask me anything.

Edit: I chose to not use the word ""victim"" because I do not see myself as a victim. I did what I did. I may not have deserved what I got, but I initiated what happened.
I don't want pity, or anything of the sort. Just getting the rest of this situation off my chest and answering questions anyone may have about what happened.

I took some steps to hide my identity, but with the story taking place in scuba small area and with personal details being put out, it's very easy to figure out. Who I am doesn't have to do with the story, but I don't care if anyone knows who I am or not.

The documentary has apparently been removed from Netflix but is still on YouTube. "
2u3cyn,We are iFixit and EFF and it's time to fix the DMCA. Let's take back our right to bypass DRM and unlock our phones.

Copyright law is shaping up to be the next big battleground in technology. It's fundamentally redefining ownership.  Due to a terrible clause in the DMCA (section 1201), by default it's illegal to bypass digital locks on hardware that you own. 

We've been chronicling the problems this is causing:

* [The End of Ownership: Why You Need to Fight America’s Copyright Laws](http://www.wired.com/2014/01/174071/)
* [Forget the Cellphone Fight — We Should Be Allowed to Unlock Everything We Own](http://www.wired.com/2013/03/you-dont-own-your-cellphones-or-your-cars/)
* [WTF! It Should Not Be Illegal to Hack Your Own Car’s Computer](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/let-us-hack-our-cars/)
* [E-Book Legal Restrictions Are Screwing Over Blind People](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/e-books-for-the-blind-should-be-legal/) (this article got republished in braille!)
* [Why Cellphone Unlocking Could Soon Be Illegal Once Again](http://www.wired.com/2014/12/dmca-exemptions-cell-phone-unlocking/)
* [Unintended Consequences: Fifteen Years under the DMCA](https://www.eff.org/pages/unintended-consequences-fifteen-years-under-dmca)

It's that time again and the Copyright Office has asked which freedoms they should grant! A whole bunch of friendly organizations have submitted requests for 27 exemptions, for everything from modding your car to fixing your tractor to reading e-books in braille and unlocking tablets. [EFF has posted all the exemption requests here](https://www.eff.org/cases/2015-dmca-rulemaking).

**What you can do:**

* [Petition to repair your car](https://act.eff.org/action/fight-for-your-right-to-repair-your-car) (Seriously, we had to make a petition to let you do this!)
* [Sign the Jailbreaking is not a crime petittion](https://act.eff.org/action/jailbreaking-is-not-a-crime)

But the most important thing you can do is to show the Copyright Office how the DMCA is hurting you or your business:

* [**Tell the Copyright Office how these freedoms would benefit you**](https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org)

**Kyle Wiens** is the co-founder of iFixit and has been crusading to make it easier for people to fix things for over a decade. I've testified in front of the International Trade Commission, written hundreds of open source repair manuals, and campaigned online and in DC to pass the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act that re-legalized phone unlocking.

**Parker Higgins** directs copyright-related activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a badass non-profit fighting to make sure your civil liberties make it onto the web and into your devices intact. EFF has participated numerous times in the DMCA rulemaking, previously securing important exemptions such as jailbreaking of phones.

**Sherwin Siy** from Public Knowledge was instrumental in getting phone unlocking legalized and has filed an exemption request for using the feedstock of your choice in 3D printers and another for ripping your DVDs to your iPads/tablets. He also wants to plug another proposed exemption for unlocking data from medical devices. *Sherwin Update 11:30: I'm going to step out a bit, I'll check in later. OK, folks, I'm going to step out for a bit. The Copyright Office wants us to prove to it that moving a move from a DVD to an iPad isn't illegal, so I'm off to dig up all the stuff from the [history of the Copyright Act](https://twitter.com/sherwinpk/status/558021996169424896), through the [Sony Betamax decision](http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/464_US_417.htm), through this year's [Fox v. Dish case](http://www.project-disco.org/intellectual-property/012215-fox-v-dish-network-lays-aereo-concerns-rest/). I'll try to stop by later to pick up any stray questions, but thanks everyone for the great chat--and especially Parker and Kyle for letting me butt in! PS: The structure of the DMCA makes me mad because it allows twisted applications of the law, but its restrictions also means something to me [personally](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/copyright-law-and-my-mothers-heart), in exemptions that PK didn't suggest.*

I'm very proud of the fact that in May 2007, I launched the newspaper the Flathead Beacon (http://flatheadbeacon.com), news for Montana's Flathead Valley, and my clothing line that I launched that is made in America, called Mother Freedom, is made in New Bedford, Massachusetts (http://motherfreedom.com). I'm an avid golfer, and a huge sports fan (especially baseball and football). I'm married to a woman named Connie Chung, who may be one of the great news reporters of all time. I have 3 children - 2 with my first wife, and 1 with Connie. And my adorable dog is named Birdie. He's going to be 4 years old in a month. He's a kind of reddish-brown Golden Retriever, born in Montana where we have a home, and he's a Canadian Breed Golden.

Glad to be joining a Reddit AMA on signing up for health insurance. There's a lot of confusion out there - yes, health insurance can be confusing - when it comes to Open Enrollment and signing up for coverage. And that confusion is even worse this year. That's why we wanted to do an AMA and it's why we started [Get America Covered](https://www.getamericacovered.org/). To cut through the confusion and make sure people have the information they need to sign up for coverage or to renew their current health insurance. 

There's only about two weeks left to sign up for coverage at [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) - the final deadline is December 15. The majority of states use [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/) but if you live in California, New York or one of the other 10 states (including DC) that operates their own exchange you'll have a bit more time.  

It can be hard to believe but health coverage really could be more affordable than you think. That's even more true this year than ever before. Because 8 out of 10 HealthCare.gov consumers qualify for financial help, most people can find plans for less than $75. In fact, [4.5 million uninsured can find health plans with zero premiums](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/press-release/analysis-more-than-half-of-uninsured-people-eligible-for-marketplace-insurance-could-pay-less-for-health-plan-than-individual-mandate-penalty/) each month. Those plans aren't right for everybody but if you're debating whether you can afford health coverage this year, you should at least check out your options - you may be surprised.

It's important to note though that if you don't qualify for financial help - premiums have gone up. Depending on where you live, premiums have gone up a lot. We can go into the details as to why but we need to fix it and make sure that politicians can't continue to play politics with your health care. 

So, let’s talk about signing up for health coverage. I'm joined today by Lori Lodes, u/llodes, and Josh Peck, u/Joshua_Peck, the co-founders of Get America Covered

Throughout my long career, I have been at the forefront of every major effort to hold corporations accountable for failing to comply with international law or their own professed standards in their codes of conduct in their treatment of workers or communities in their far flung supply chains.

Rather than assume multinationals operate in good faith, I shifted my focus entirely, and for the last 25 years, have specialized in international human rights litigation.

The prospect of getting a legal judgement along with the elevated public profile of a major legal case (thank you, Reddit!) gives IRAdvocates a concrete tool to force bad actors in the global economy to improve their practices.

.................................................................

WE ARE AWAKE!

Hello everyone! 

My name is E. S. Fein, and I have been lucid dreaming for the last 19 years. I started when I was 13, getting most of my information, insight, questions, and answers from a forum that is still active today called LD4ALL.com. It is a really exceptional community (though I admit I haven't been on those forums for at least a decade). 

In 2013 I published a guide to lucid dreaming on a website I developed with a small team at the time called Wondergressive.com. 

The guide: [Lucid Dreaming Guide](https://wondergressive.com/lucid-dreaming-guide-dream-control/)

My short, free guide has been viewed millions of times on my own site, and it has been republished on countless other sites as well (with and without permission lol, though I don't mind! I WANT people to lucid dream! It's truly an exceptional tool for inward exploration). Tens of thousands of people over the past 8 years or so have reached out to me for help on their lucid dreaming journey, asking for insight beyond what I provided in the beginner's guide. 

The whole reason I decided to do this was after seeing the previous lucid dreaming AMA. I really don't want all of you to think that the world of lucid dreaming is just one giant sales pitch for some dude's book. I really don't mind supporting indie authors (I'm an indie author of multiple science fiction novels myself!), but the answers were just so lackluster...it was just a big let down to me. So, I offer my knowledge and years of teaching and providing support to students in numerous fields of expertise, including lucid dreaming.

If you want to follow me on social media, check out any of my work, or reach out to me personally, everything you need to know (I think?) can be found on my site, [OfficialESFein.com](http://officialesfein.com/)

So, ask away, fellow oneironauts, psychonauts, and generally curious minds!

~~Edit 2: Sorry everyone. The mods already confirmed I had enough proof. Now they are saying I don't have enough proof. I guess I'll try to do an AMA at a later date.~~

Edit 3: The mods have reinstated the post, so I'll get back to answering your questions. Sorry for the delay, everyone! I'll be around most of the day, though, and I can keep answering questions through the weekend as well, so no worries!

Edit 4: Wow you guys have amazing questions, and this picked up even more traction than I thought it would. I will be getting to everyone's question, rest assured. It might just take me a while!

Edit 5: Holy wow everyone! We are still going strong. I'm going to go eat and take a shower, and I'll be back to keep answering questions through the night. Thanks so much for your intense interest in this subject!

Edit 6: I'll be spending time tomorrow and time over the weekend to get to questions I haven't yet. Thank you everyone for your interest. It makes me so happy that you are all so interested in this subject! :)

Edit 7: The reddit hug of death just took down my guide and the whole site lol. Just be patient. It will be back up shortly.

Edit 8: Okay, there are now thousands of comments. Odds are I'm not going to get to everyone at this rate, even if I keep going over the weekend. I'm so sorry if I don't get to you, but as I continue, I'm going to try to go for comments that are new questions, so if I don't answer you, there is a huge chance your question has already been answered along the way.

Edit 9: I've held out for as long as possible, but it's time for some sleep and hopefully some lucidity! I have some work tomorrow, but I'll be back on throughout the day. I'll return on Saturday and part of Sunday as well to keep answering as many questions as I can. Thank you everyone! All the best to you, and stay diligent in your practice!

Edit 10: Day 2. You guys are STILL going lol. So I will too. Like I said, I have some work today, but I'll be back and forth between work and answering questions, and I will have even more time tomorrow. Keep at it, everyone! And thanks again!


I just wanted to add this question and answer up here, because I feel like this is so important to remember:

/u/wooden_muffin_9880: 

Would getting good at this make real life seem less worth it or something? Is reality disappointing now?

My Answer:

Not in the slightest. Reality still carries with it the endless enigma of unknowing. When I dream, I know I'm in dream. I know it is just a simulation created by my mind. But reality? I have no idea what reality -- waking life -- actually is. I have nothing to compare it to except for dreams, which stem from waking life. I love my reality, but I have also worked hard to build a reality I am very fond of. I have travelled all over the world. I have accomplished every dream I ever set for myself. There is nothing I feel like I missed out on. Plus, reality contains all my favorite people. All dreams can do is offer me simulacrums of those people.

No, reality is not disappointing. If anything, the dreams are. Reality is a constant mystery, but lucid dreams are whatever I want them to be. Over time, that can definitely become boring, to a degree."

You seem to think all jokes involving minorities are offensive, but jokes about whites and males are hilarious. What is your reasoning for this?

They sent me to Doha for the past 2.5 years. While there, I worked on some amazing projects and was in the most elite of practice groups. I had my second son. I witnessed a society that had the most extreme rich:poor divide you could imagine. I met people who considered other people to be of less human worth. I helped a poor mother get deported after she spent 3 years in jail for having a baby out of wedlock, arrested at the hospital and put in jail with her baby. I became disgusted by luxury lifestyle and lawyers who would give anything and everything to make millions. I encountered blatant gender discrimination, sexual harassment, and a very clear glass ceiling. Having a baby apparently makes you worth less as a lawyer. While overseas, I became inspired to start a company making boy dolls after I couldn't find any cool ones for my own sons. So I hired my sister to start a company that I would direct. Complete divergence from my line of work, I know, but I was convinced this would be a great niche business. As a lawyer, I was working sometimes 300 hours in a month and missing my kids all the time. I felt guilty for spending any time not firm related. I never had a vacation where I did not work. I missed my dear grandmother's funeral in December. In March I made the final decision that this could not last. There must be a better way. So I resigned. And now I am sitting in my mother's living room, having moved the whole family in temporarily - I have not lived with my mother since I was 17. I have moved out of Qatar. I have given up my very nice salary. I have no real plans except I am joining my sister to build my company. And I'm feeling a bit surreal and possibly insane for having given it up. Ask me anything!

**I'm answering questions as fast as I can!  Wow!  But my 18 month old just work up jet lagged too and is trying to eat my computer.....slowing me down a bit!**

**This is crazy - I can't type as fast as the questions come in, but I'll answer them.  This is fascinating.  AM I SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO EVERYONE??!**

**10:25 AM EST:  Taking a short break.  Kids are now awake and want to actually spend time with them :)**

**11:15 AM EST:  Back online.  Will answer as many questions as I can.  Kids are with husband and grandma playing!**

***PS: I was thinking about this during my break:  A lot of people have asked why I am doing this now.  I have wanted to say some public things about my experience for quite some time but really did not dare to do so until I was outside of Qatar, and I also wanted to wait until the law firm chapter of my life was officially closed.  I have always been conservative in expressing my opinion about my experience in Qatar while living there because of the known incidents of arrests for saying things in public that are contrary to the social welfare and moral good.  This Reddit avenue appealed to me because now I feel free to actually say what I think about things and have an open discussion.  It is so refreshing - thank you everyone for the comments and questions.  Forums like this are such a testament to the value of freedom of expression.***

Before joining APOPO, I worked for the operations section of the Geneva International Center of Humanitarian Demining (GICHD), and contributed my technical field experience to the land release methodology. I’ve 11 years of experience in Mine Action operations in Africa, in both humanitarian and commercial sectors. I’m joined by our Online Development Manager, Robin Toal, also known as /u/APOPO_Robin. Ask us anything!

[Proof #2 with actual Tess!](https://twitter.com/HeroRATs/status/644888289200185345) 

EDIT: Tess has had to disappear so you're stuck with me, /u/APOPO_Robin, from here on out. For the sake of visibility I'm going to take over Tess's account. 

EDIT 2: If you enjoy science you can read all of our published research into scent detection technology (HeroRATs!) here - https://www.apopo.org/en/contact/press/publications

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for your questions and support, it's been a blast. I'll be back in the morning to answer any remaining questions. Remember, HeroRATs never die. 

**More info:** 

Our demining team in Mozambique (including the HeroRATs!) cleared 13,274 landmines and returned 11,124,446 square metres of land (the equivalent of 46,106 houses in the US) for safe and productive use. 

APOPO has helped rid five provinces of landmines, returning safe land back to local communities to live, work, farm and play without fear. Most households in these areas are headed by smallholder farmers who have not been able to use the land to grow crops and sustain their livestock for decades, until APOPO arrived to clear and release the area. 

APOPO will remain in the country at the request of the National Institute of Demining (IND), to continue providing technical expertise and capacity for any residual or remaining clearance work such as the former ammunitions store now known as the Malhazine Ecological Park, which Mozambique’s Ministry of Environment is transforming into a nature reserve, educational and tourism centre.

**Topic:** There is an appalling lack of coordinated crowd-based (or self-reported) data collection initiatives related to COVID-19. Currently, if coronavirus tests are negative, there is no mandatory reporting to the CDC...meaning many valuable datapoints are going uncollected. I am currently reaching out to government groups and politicians to help put forth a database with Public Health in mind. We created https://aitia.app and want to encourage widespread submission of datapoints for all people, healthy or not. With so many infectious diseases presenting symptoms in similar ways, we need to collect more baseline data so we can better understand the public health implications of the coronavirus.

Hey reddit! We’re the team behind Squatty Potty. If you haven’t heard of us, we created the toilet stool that helps you poop better. Anatomically, humans were designed to squat. We did it for thousands of years! Along came the invention of the modern day toilet, and while extremely convenient, it puts your body into a sit. This kinks your puborectalis muscle and makes it more difficult to eliminate. The Squatty Potty takes you from a sit to a squat, allowing you to use your toilet and poop better at the same time!

Here's the [rough planned route](http://i.imgur.com/P7IYyp1.png). I'm hitting Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Each time I get to a city, I'm doing small meetups. The times and dates for those meetups are announced when I'm close enough to each city to know when and where they'll be. Announcements on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/bendoeslife).

Today is day 74 and I'm thinking I'll finish Saturday, July 23rd. 

I'll be answering questions on and off all day.

Edit: I might not answer EVERY question asked. I underestimated how much it hurts my wrists. But I'm going strong. 

Edit 2: I've gotta call it quits for the night, but I'm on all the time, so I'l be answering questions over the next couple weeks. [Follow on Instagram](http://instagram.com/bendoeslife), if you're into that sort of thing, for regular daily updates and meetup spots in major cities.

While such scams have proliferated on social media for years, Facebook and the United States military appear helpless to stop it.

I also questioned Facebook and the Pentagon about what they do (and don't do) to combat the problem. And I traveled to Nigeria to talk to the scammers and understand where the cons originate.

At The Times, I cover the immense influence of large technology companies like Facebook and Apple. I’ve written about [celebrity impostors](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/07/technology/facebook-instagram-twitter-celebrity-impostors.html) on Facebook and Instagram, as well as [fake Mark Zuckerbergs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/technology/fake-mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html) that scam people out of cash.

Hi, I’m the host of the Major Jobs Podcast, where I try to help teenagers like me discover different jobs. 

In my last AMA, there was an overwhelming response to do more conventional jobs, so I did just that. I've gotten to talk to tradesmen, machinists, software engineers, attorneys, accountants, and more. I wanted to do a kinda updated AMA 4 months later so I could answer some more questions people had.

(below is copy and pasted from my previous ama)
As a teen, I find it harder and harder to know what kinds of careers are out there and which ones I should do, and I feel like a lot of teenagers feel the same way. I wanted to try to do something to help, and started a podcast where I interview different people about their jobs to teach teenagers (and adults) about what it’s like being a particular career. I’ve interviewed amazing people, and love doing it. 

Some (more famous) guests have included Grammy-winning band Portugal. the Man, language creator David J. Peterson, CONAN producer Aaron Bleyaert, and Inside the NBA Host Ernie Johnson, but I also talk to people with conventional jobs like tradesmen, accountants, dentists, and more.

*Edited 2:30 EST*: Ok, we get it. You don't like CNN. Seriously though, thanks so much for all these responses, and the robust debate that's taken place here today. Although none of us are journalists ourselves, we really relish these conversations, particularly challenging ones, about the state of the world's media and of freedom of expression, and it's really great to see so much engagement on critically important issues. We may not agree on everything, but hopefully we agree that freedom of expression needs to be safeguarded against all threats.

Things appear to be winding down a bit, so we're going to call time at 15:00 EST. Thanks again!

*Edited 8:30 pm*: Circled back through and saw that a couple of questions about Saudi Arabia and Iran have risen to the top, so I thought I'd address them. Saudi Arabia has an absolutely atrocious human rights record, including but not limited to free speech issues. One of the world's worst governments, and one which several of my colleagues on this AMA have been highly critical of in the past:
https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38207/en/saudi-arabia:-poet-ashraf-fayadh-given-death-sentence-for-apostasy 
http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/browse/5/backpid/59/category/gender-equality/article/ifj-condemns-brutal-and-inhumane-saudi-action-against-woman-journalist/

My own organization hasn't been very active on Saudi Arabia not because we have any affinity for that horrendous government, but rather because, as a small organization, we tend to focus our resources on countries where we see some potential of impacting positive change, which just isn't the case in Saudi. It's the same reason we haven't been that active on China or North Korea. We look for places we can make a difference, as opposed to those whose governments are completely indifferent to human rights criticism.

Regarding Iran - another atrocious government, and again one which my colleagues have been sharply critical of: https://www.article19.org/en/azad/, http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/backpid/1/article/iran-three-journalists-arrested-in-one-week/. Again, it's not an area we've been particularly active, because, as /u/hotsoccerchic points out, outside criticisms seem to only fuel the hardliners. In terms of what to do in a case like that - solidarity among the rest of the world is important, as well as consideration of a country's human rights record in establishing economic relations. Without necessarily coming out in support or opposition to the recent Iranian nuclear deal, I do think that the country's human rights record has, to a certain degree, fallen by the wayside with the focus on their nuclear programme. Hopefully, with the proliferation of the Internet and the increasing democratisation of tools of mass communication, Iran's youth will be empowered to finish the work of the Green Revolution in 2009 though, like Turkey and the Philippines, when a country is dead-set against respecting human rights, and has solid support of the army and security services, it's incredibly challenging to impact change."

Along with my business partner, Joe Magnotti, we started building and selling our own websites back in 2009-2010, but eventually pivoted to a brokerage & marketplace where we bring together sellers, buyers, and investors to close deals.

The company has grown quite a bit in the last few years - from $200K in sales in 2012 to nearly $10M in 2016 - enough to get us listed at #161 on the [INC 5000 list](https://www.inc.com/profile/empire-flippers). To date, we’ve helped broker more than $22M in online business sales and are on track to do around $18 - 20M in 2017.

We are a US based company, but run our business from SE Asia and we’ve grown our team by hiring “apprentices” and bringing them halfway around the world to join us. As they grow they become part of our core team.

Our management team is technically “location independent”, but we all get together every 3-4 months to spend a month working together. Our current get together is happening right now in Saigon, Vietnam. We just hired 4 new apprentices and are experiencing one of the biggest months in the company’s history with over $3 Million in online businesses sold.

I’m a fan of Reddit and the /r/IAmA sub, so I’m really hoping to provide value and give back to the community. We broker almost every type of online business (Adsense, Amazon Affiliate, FBA, E-commerce, Private Affiliate, iOS apps, SaaS, etc.) and have seen thousands of unique and successful businesses. You can read more about the 11 most popular type of online business models here: https://empireflippers.com/11-popular-business-models-online/

Feel free to AMA about buying, selling or investing in online businesses, building management teams, starting a podcast, growing our business, interesting niches, living/working remotely, or anything else!

**Edit #2**

Quite a bit of our business success was due to creating high quality content that educates and expands our industry which is why we LOVE doing things like this - we really enjoy interacting with everyone here. I hope you're digging it as well.

Getting quite a few in-depth questions that we've covered elsewhere.

**Edit #3**

Hey all - thank you so much for this amazing opportunity! It's after 2am here in Saigon, Vietnam right now, so I'm going to cut this off and go to bed tonight. I'll wake up tomorrow and try to get back to your questions - hopefully you'll find them helpful/useful.

I know plenty of you are new to business - particularly online business models - but we wrote a post that goes into some depth explaining how each of the 11 most popular online business models works.

It's for newbies mostly, but even if you have some experience you might find some value...especially when we talk about them from a buying/selling perspective.

You can check that post out here:

Again - thank you so much and I'll try to get back to more of your questions tomorrow!

**Edit #4**

Thank you all so much for stopping in - I had a blast doing this! I think I answered most of the questions you had, so I think it's time to shut this down. If you didn't get an answer I probably answered a similar question someplace else.

OK, here we go. Some background:

My father is a British citizen who has been living in Ukraine for the past 15 or so years. He has a Ukrainian wife and 11yo daughter.

After the Russian invasion began, he chose to take the opportunity to escape the country by car, first securing an emergency travel document for his daughter, and then returning home, packing a car with clothes and supplies, and driving his wife and daughter back to the UK to stay with family in safety.

After driving 1100+km over the weekend from his town to reach the Slovakian/Ukrainian border, he has spent the last 42 HOURS in a huge convoy of vehicles trying to, well, do the same thing as he's trying to do - escape Ukraine.

[He is unable to sleep as every time he drifts off he needs to move 1-2 car lengths forward as the queue moves](https://i.imgur.com/gODxzVh.png). There are three separate lanes, and thousands of cars queuing to get over the border.

He has spent the vast majority of the last 42 hours trapped in the car with his wife and daughter, making the agonisingly slow creep forward towards the border.  I've been in regular contact with him since the invasion began. Today I've been talking to him constantly for the last few hours, mostly to keep him company and keep him sane. [He has not been able to bathe or take a shit in the last 2 and a half days](https://i.imgur.com/CNGKvNQ.png).

I am his second child from his first marriage, one of three. I am 38, I live in New Zealand. I communicate with him via text and voice messages on WhatsApp. His internet is patchy but I can talk to him on WhatsApp, relay any questions anyone may have about his experiences from here to him, and then transcribe or copypaste his responses back. I may be able to give additional context myself - I've been talking to him consistently for the past few days, so it may be that you ask something obvious that I've already asked him about and can respond directly. 

So just to be clear, **I'm doing my best to act as a conduit between my dad and Reddit**, you're not speaking directly to my dad, everything is going through me. I will try to be diligent with marking everything up so it's clear whose voice you're getting.

I had the idea to do this AMA because I thought questions would be a distraction for him as he is unable to sleep, and I have been fascinated by the insight I've got from talking to him about this experience. I thought it would be an interesting thing to share. Feel free to ask him about his experience, his life in Ukraine, his opinions, whatever you like. He is happy to answer questions for as long as he can stay awake.

It is currently around 4am where he is and his wife and daughter are sleeping in the car, everything is pitch black besides his phone screen. I don't know how long he can stay to answer questions (when his wife wakes up it'll be her turn to edge the car forward and he should be able to take a nap). But I will keep relaying things to him for him to answer later.

Only one request: **please keep it civil**. He and his family have been through enough in the past few days. This is not a joke or an opportunity for you to show how edgy you can be.

Proof: I have confidentially verified with mods already.

---

~~UPDATE: After some 43 hours, the border is finally in sight, but still probably quite a wait until they're through. Dad is still happy to answer questions, so keep them coming.~~

~~UPDATE 2: Dad has stopped responding to my messages for now (I get two grey ticks on WhatsApp, meaning they've been delivered but not read). For now, I'll go through the unread questions and answer any of them that I can answer myself. He is likely taking a nap.~~

~~UPDATE 3: OK, sorry everyone. My dad is absolutely shattered, and he physically can't keep his eyes open any longer. He needs to rest. However, he has said how much he has enjoyed this and what a welcome distraction it has been, and how happy he is that he can share his experience with you all. He also said that once he's had a rest, he would love to resume and continue answering your questions.~~

~~I'm going to go through and answer any of the current questions that I am able to answer - I will not speak for my dad, but some questions have already been asked and some are things that I have talked to him about already at some point in the past. Once dad is back I will try to respond to everyone.~~

~~I also want to add some of the audio recordings to a few of the answers, only the ones with no personal information. I think they add a lot, personally - makes his answers a lot more personal. I don't mind transcribing what my dad writes, and I try to capture his voice and intonation, but sometimes it's impossible to render it in text. Any responses with audio will have a link at the top of the response.~~

~~UPDATE 4: Dad is up and wants to answer more questions! Will be playing catchup for a while, but please feel free to keep going. The border is getting close now, but still a while to go.~~

~~UPDATE 5: It's just after 1pm where he is now. We started this around 4am his time, so it's been a solid 7 or so hours of relaying stuff back and forth for me. Dad managed a power nap in the middle but I am tired and I need to go to bed. 51 hours now in the queue now. Still queuing, but the border is getting closer and closer and it looks like he will cross over today.~~

~~I think I'm going to call it here for now. My fingers are a little sore. I really hope this was interesting/insightful. My dad and I want to thank everybody for being involved in this, and for all your questions, and your messages of support. I'd also like to thank all the people who PMed me with offers of help or asking if there's anything you could do. You are all thoroughly beautiful people.~~

**UPDATE 6: DAD AND FAMILY ARE OVER THE BORDER! Some 60 hours total, I think. They are now in Slovakia. [I'll let him fill you in himself!](https://vocaroo.com/16tDgMpN81EW) My and my wife's names are mentioned in there, but I don't really care. He's completely shattered and his eyes are bothering him (he recently had cataract surgery on both eyes). The last bit is him just gushing about how cute my dog is (and [rightly so, he's a stunner](https://i.imgur.com/xVdYydZ.jpg)). As you can hear, he really enjoyed yesterday. This AMA really helped the last part of the queue go by a little faster and more easily for my dad, his wife, and his daughter, which was my original intention in setting this up, before it evolved into something much more. I was not expecting it to take off like it did. So, thank you everybody for your questions and comments. I will continue to pass on your kind messages once he's up again!**

**Oh, and before the inevitable questions... I'm not sure if he has taken a shit yet. He's a morning pooper so I'm assuming probably not, but he's going to be committing a war crime of his own on that poor hotel toilet after he wakes up.**

**My dad will NOT let me end this without adding a link to his stepson's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyn9dI6-nBjmm1rSLTaN1_A) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ado.khayat/) accounts - he is a semi-famous and very talented young musician in Ukraine.**

**If you have more questions, please feel free to post and if they're new then I'll relay them to my dad, and he'll probably be able to answer at some point tomorrow or in the next few days.**"

I help the *good-intentioned gentleman* get on a date through a customized strategy that doesn't require them to change who they are. My popular nickname is the **Modern Day (female) Hitch**!

I knew my passion since high school and wanted a career in the dating/relationship field. Despite my Asian parents wishes, I followed my passion anyway.

I worked for the matchmaking firm *It’s Just Lunch* and was the lead matchmaker, trainer, & Coach at [eHarmony](http://www.eharmony.com/) ’s eH+. I earned a Masters degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from USC and a Bachelors degree in Social Work from SDSU. I worked in mental health with couples, realizing many of the couples should not have been together in the first place.

I use my extensive experience from previous matchmaking firms with a combination of training in marital counseling to provide my clients the best and most effective strategies in finding and keeping long-lasting love. With my positive energy, straight-forward (sorry, no sugar coating) approach, hope, and passion, I value the collaboration with my clients and am always excited to guide my clients on the journey to find lasting love and happiness.

i've had many clients and friends telling me I should do an AMA for years, so here I am! Let's do this :)

The idea for Jump came from our own struggles as indie developers, and so we’ve built the service to be as beneficial for game developers as it is for gamers. 

Jump offers unlimited access to a highly curated library of 60+ games at launch for a flat monthly fee. We’re constantly adding new games every month, and they all have to meet our quality standards to make sure you get the best gaming experience. Jump delivers most games in under 60-seconds via our HyperJump technology, which is NOT streaming, but rather delivers games in chunks to your computer so they run as if they were installed (no latency or quality issues), but without taking up permanent hard drive space.

After huge victories in India and the US, now it's Europe's turn to fight for net neutrality! We  are a group of digital rights experts leading the fight. We can explain how net neutrality works in Europe, why this fight matters, and how you can help. 

Our current law is full of loopholes. This summer, it's up to the European telecoms regulators, BEREC, to interpret that law. Their decision could make or break net neutrality. 

We need a huge response from netizens supporting net neutrality, or else we’ll be drowned out by lobbyists.  Your support is invaluable, and only takes a minute or two: 

**message our regulators at www.savetheinternet.eu**.

We are: 

* Thomas Lohninger, AKVorrat
* Joe McNamee, European Digital Rights
* Estelle Massé, AccesNow
* Rejo Zenger, Bits of Freedom
* Agnès de Cornulier, La Quadrature du Net



We will start answering questions at 14:00 PM CEST / 8:00 AM EST, and we'll stick around for at least two hours. 

**UPDATE:**
Wow, the response has been great. We'll stick around a while longer. So keep the questions coming! ;)

**UPDATE#2:**
Our US partners from Fight For the Future are joining soon. They can help explain this to American redditors as the west coast wakes up. 

**We also point to our Day of Action the Internet Slowdown day on 28. June. Check it out at http://www.savenetneutrality.eu !** 

**UPDATE#3:**
We are signing off for today. But it was real fun with you guys, let's do this again. Please participate in the consultation on https://savetheinternet.eu, it only takes 1 minute. Our friends from Fight For the Future will be around for a while longer, but its getting late in Europe.

The American Red Cross raised nearly half a billion dollars following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010 — far more than any other charity providing relief. Internally, the disaster was seen as ""a spectacular fundraising opportunity.""

But on the ground in Haiti, the Red Cross effort was marked by a string of failures. A ProPublica and [NPR investigation](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/03/411524156/in-search-of-the-red-cross-500-million-in-haiti-relief) uncovered confidential memos, emails from top officers, and accounts of a dozen insiders that show how the charity broke promises, squandered donations, and made dubious claims of success. **For instance, the charity claimed it provided homes to more than 130,000 Haitians. They didn't. They built only six permanent homes.**

I’m Bishop Robert Barron, founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries, Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and host of the award-winning ""CATHOLICISM"" series, which aired on PBS.

About a year ago, I became the first Catholic Bishop to host an AMA on Reddit, which you can read here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9h5oi0/im\_a\_catholic\_bishop\_and\_philosopher\_who\_loves/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9h5oi0/im_a_catholic_bishop_and_philosopher_who_loves/)

It was a great experience—very much like the quodlibetal questions of the Middle Ages—and I wanted to come back and do it again!

I'm a religion correspondent for NBC and have also appeared on ""The Rubin Report,"" the Jordan B. Peterson Podcast, and the Ben Shapiro Show. 

I've been invited to speak about religion at the headquarters of Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and I've keynoted many conferences and events all over the world. I'm also a #1 Amazon bestselling author and have published numerous books, essays, and articles on theology and the spiritual life.

My website, [https://WordOnFire.org](https://wordonfire.org/), reaches millions of people each year, and I'm one of the world's most followed Catholics on social media:

* 1.7 million+ Facebook fans ([https://facebook.com/BishopRobertBarron](https://facebook.com/BishopRobertBarron))

This year there have been just 6 cases of polio due to the wild polio virus - we are on the verge of making polio history. AMA!",13484,0.87,379,2017-06-20 21:49:16,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6if2wr/i_am_dr_john_sever_vice_chair_of_rotarys/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6if2wr/i_am_dr_john_sever_vice_chair_of_rotarys/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"On June 12, Rotary and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced an extension and increase of their financial commitment in an effort to eradicate polio worldwide once and for all. Additionally, 16 governments and several organizations have just pledged $1.2B to eradicate polio.  Rotary has already contributed over 1.6 billion U.S. dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours of volunteer time to the eradication of polio. When we succeed in eradicating polio, it would become only the second disease to be eradicated by vaccines, the other being smallpox.

 
Personally, I have known Dr. Salk, creator of the inactivated polio vaccine, and Dr. Sabin, creator of the oral polio vaccine through my work at the National Institutes of Health. In 1979 the last case of endemic polio was reported in the U.S. I, along with Rotary International president, Clem Renouf, brought to Rotary the idea to make it our chief goal to eradicate polio worldwide.  For the last 11 years, I have been carrying on the visions of Drs. Salk and Sabin as the vice-chairman of Rotary International’s PolioPlus program, which helps oversee Rotary’s polio vaccination efforts worldwide. 

 
Context:

 
In 1916, polio was an epidemic in the United States with over 27,000 cases and 6,000 deaths. Following the availability of Dr. Salk’s inactivated vaccine in 1955 and Dr. Sabin’s oral polio vaccine in 1962, polio began to decline in developed countries where they were used. That decline began to accelerate as groups such as Rotary International began to champion the issue in the early 1980s.

 
Today, polio is nearly eradicated globally, as we’ve seen a 99.9% reduction – from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to just 6 reported cases so far in 2017. Polio is virtually eradicated, but there is still so much more to do. If we don’t continue to vaccinate, we could see 200,000 new cases every year – giving polio an unprecedented resurgence.

I’m Tony Menendez, a CPA and a corporate whistleblower. A decade ago, I was Halliburton’s Director of Technical Accounting and I witnessed some highly questionable accounting and auditing practices at Halliburton. After being told to “save it for the subpoena,” I blew the whistle. Although, Halliburton’s retaliation was swift, my journey through the legal process and the fight for my rights was not. I trusted the system and paid the price. After four years and losing at every stage in the legal process, I ran out of attorneys. With nothing left to lose, I spent several years representing myself. Now, nine years after blowing the whistle, I have prevailed and it appears that I am in the final throes of my battle with Halliburton. *(Joe Ahmad, my attorney, is accompanying me.)*

From original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/GoneErotic/comments/6jnawj/trying_to_feel_sexy_after_a_double_mastectomy_at/): 
""So ever since I first found out that I needed to have a double mastectomy at 23, I've been searching the internet for any kind of porn or something that includes women who have had a double mastectomy. I was about to find one picture. One. There are plenty of pictures of strong women looking powerful and brave but I wanted something that would prove to me that I can still be sexy after the surgery. I'm not trying to say that being sexualized is a good thing but there's something about seeing your body type represented in porn that makes you feel a little bit accepted. Well, I decided that taking ""nudes"" of myself might be a way to help make myself feel better. I started taking these kinds of pictures as recently as two weeks after the surgery! While it helped me to take these pictures, I realized that I couldn't change anything about society by keeping them to myself so I thought about it long and hard and discussed it with my boyfriend/the love of my life and finally decided to post it on here.
I've posted this picture here to inspire any women to feel sexy. I've posted it here to feel sexy myself. And I'm hoping that posting this picture here will start to change how people look at women after a double mastectomy.
Thank you for looking at my picture and thank you for listening to what I have to say. I'd love to hear any thoughts on this. :)""

We're just eight days away from what may be the most important election Australia has ever seen. If we're serious about the twin challenges of climate change and economic inequality - we need to get rid of this mob.

This election the Australian Greens are offering a fully independently costed plan that offers a genuine alternative to the old parties. While they're competing over the size of their tax cuts and surpluses, we're offering a plan that will make Australia more compassionate, and bring in a better future for all of us.

Check our our plan here: https://greens.org.au/policies

Some highlights:

* Getting out of coal, moving to 100% renewables by 2030 (and create 180,000 jobs in the process)
* Raising Newstart by $75 a week so it's no longer below the poverty line
* Full dental under Medicare
* Bring back free TAFE and Uni
* A Federal ICAC with real teeth

We can pay for it by:

* Close loopholes that let the super-rich pay no tax
* Fix the PRRT, that's left fossil fuel companies sitting on a $367 billion tax credit
* End the tax-free fuel rebate for mining companies

After working for 13 years as the executive pastry chef for Ritz-Carlton, I got tired of traveling 40+ weeks out of the year and missing out on my children growing up. I started making chocolate and selling it to local chefs and restaurants in 2001, and in 2002 USA Today somehow discovered us and named us as one of the top chocolate producers in the country and our business took off!

In the 15 years since, we’ve been fortunate enough to open 4 retail locations & a gelato shop, partner with Princess Cruises to provide chocolate and custom desserts for their “Chocolate Journeys” program, and attract some of the most talented pastry chefs in the business to work for us. I love what I do and I’d love to answer any questions you might have for me. AMA!

**EDIT 1** I mentioned this somewhere in the comments, but for the record my wife never gave me any sort of ultimatum - the ""or else"" was meant to be a joking summary of a series of long discussions we had about trying to find a way for me to actually be able to spend time at home with my family. I've always had her full support, and if I had wanted to, I could have continued working at the Ritz for years and she would have continued raising our kids on her own. I didn't, though. I traveled so often that my kids thought I worked at the airport and that was heartbreaking.

I’m Adam Moelis. I'm the co-founder of [Yotta](https://www.withyotta.com/), a free app that uses behavioral economics to help people save money by making saving exciting. 

For every $25 deposited into an FDIC-insured Yotta account, users get a recurring ticket into our weekly random number drawings with chances to win prizes ranging from $0.10 to the $10 million jackpot. Even if you don't win a prize, you still get paid over 2x the national average on your savings (we currently offer a 0.2% savings bonus). 

Taking inspiration from savings programs in other countries like Premium Bonds in the UK, we’re on a mission to put state-run lotteries that often act as and are described as a “tax on the poor” out of business while improving the financial health of Americans through evangelizing the benefits of “[prize-linked savings accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prize-linked_savings_account)” here in the US.  A [Freakonomics podcast](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/say-no-no-lose-lottery-rebroadcast/) has described prize-linked savings accounts as a ""no-lose lottery"".

As part of building Yotta, I spent lots of time studying how lotteries (Powerball & Mega Millions) and scratch tickets across the country work, consulting with behind-the-scenes state lottery employees, and working with PhDs on understanding the psychology behind why people play the lottery despite it being such a sub-optimal financial decision.

The direction of technology solution for more integration is supported with clinical evidence of the benefit to usres.  Reduction of effort in powering the movement to reduction of risk of falls, low back pain and tissue injury is further evidence of health economic during the life of users. With increased customisation the next layer of integration as part of system thinking is the product and services which 're models our and many other industries.

So, now, I am managing our company's largest store, and am swamped with managerial duties, training employees, and dealing with annoying vendors. But, I'm taking some time out for all of you guys.

There are lots of new, exciting things that have recently come out/are coming soon! 

For those who ***NEED*** the most power, I've got just the Crack you need! Since we last talked, there are new bagless and cordless vacuums on the market, and some other exciting things.

So, on to business...here's the copypasta.

[First AMA ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1pe2bd/iama_vacuum_repair_technician_and_i_cant_believe/)

[Second AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24rx7e/hi_reddit_im_here_to_make_your_day_suck_better/)

[Last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2ldfs3/iama_vacuum_repair_technician_and_this_is_the_1/)

[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/donttouchmycoffee/)
Here's some basics to get you started:


* Dollar for dollar, a bagged vacuum, when compared to a bagless, will almost always:

1) Perform better (Actual quality of cleaning).

2) Be in service for much longer.

3) Cost less to repair and maintain (Often including consumables).

4) Filter your air better.

Virtually every vacuum professional in the business chooses a bagged vacuum for their homes, because we know what quality is.
Things you should do to maintain your vac, regularly:

1) Clear your brush roller/agitator of hair and fibers. Clear the bearing caps as well, if possible. (monthly)

2) Change your belts before they break. This is important to maintain proper tension against the agitator. (~ yearly for ""stretch"" belts)

3) Never use soap when washing any parts of your vacuum, including the outer bag, duct system, agitator, filters, etc. Soap attracts dirt, and is difficult to rinse away thoroughly.

* Types of vacs:

1) Generally, canister vacs are quieter and more versatile than uprights are. They offer better filtration, long lifespans, and ease of use. They handle bare floors best, and work with rugs and carpets, as well.

2) Upright vacuums are used mostly for homes that are entirely carpeted. Many have very powerful motors, great accessories, and are available in a couple of different motor styles. Nothing cleans shag carpeting like the right upright.

3) Bagless vacs are available in a few different styles. They rely on filters and a variety of aerodynamic methods to separate the dirt from the air. In general, these machines do not clean or filter as well as bagged vacuums. They suffer from a loss of suction, and tend to clog repeatedly, if the filters are not cleaned or replaced often.

4) Bagged vacuums use a disposable bag to collect debris, which acts as your primary filter, before the air reaches the motor, and is replaced when you fill it. Because this first filter is changed, regularly, bagged vacuums tend to provide stronger, more consistent suction.

My last, best piece of advice is to approach a vacuum, like any appliance; Budget for the best one you can get. Buy one with idea you will maintain it, and use it for many years.

I was held in captivity by mother and stepfather until I was almost 19 years old. My stepfather forced my family to dress and live like the Amish. My sister and I escaped our abusive home by agreeing to join the Amish. Three years after joining the Amish I became the maid for the bishop's family and for the next 6 months, I was sexually abused by the bishop. I went against Amish church customs and reported him to the police but he escaped into Canada. In 2017 ( 12 years later) the bishop was finally sentenced to 10 years in prison for molesting almost all of his 11 children. 


The bishop had brought his family back to the USA and in 2016 the three oldest daughters went to a neighbor lady for help. The neighbor called CPS and they called in law enforcement. The detective assigned to the case was reading my [memoir ](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)   at the time and when one of the children mentioned they had lived in Canada for awhile he figured out that the man he was investigating was the bishop from the book he was reading. I was put in contact with the children and their social worker. Eventually raising awareness did make a difference. The Social worker told me that my memoir helped her understand how to communicate with the children and gave her insight into Amish beliefs. The children told me that they were wavering on prosecuting their dad until they discovered my memoir. Sadly, our entire church had known what kind of man the bishop was but did not report him to the police. Going to the police is severely frowned upon among the Amish. 

I wrote my memoir  [Tears of the Silenced](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1520379874&sr=1-1) (self published)  to raise awareness about the need to report suspected child abuse and the difficulties I faced when reporting the Amish bishop. In the three years since I published *Tears of the Silenced* I have received emails from all over the world ( England, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Germany, Denmark and Holland). Most are from child abuse and sexual assault survivors and many grew up in very strict Christian churches. They are from both men and women and each story is heartbreaking. I try to answer each email and offer what comfort or help that I can. Most of them tell me I am the first person they have ever told their stories to. 

I hope to encourage all abuse survivors to speak out and tell their stories. It is very painful to do so but it can raise awareness and possibly save others from being abused by the abuser(s). There is much awareness needed about sexual abuse in very conservative churches. Many victims are too scared to come forward because they fear being ostracised from the church. Also, child abuse is an issue that never gets enough attention. Somehow we need to encourage the general public to report suspected cases of child abuse. After I left the Amish many people from the town where I lived as a child apologized for not helping my sister and me. They told me that they knew we were being abused and wanted to call CPS many times but our religious garb threw them off and they did not know what to do. 

I had a 2nd or 3rd-grade education when I left the Amish. Today, 13 years later, I am in the last year of nursing school and an author. (My [memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Tears-Silenced-American-Tragedy-Leaving-ebook/dp/B00RETC8B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) is self published but has sold approx 100,000 ebooks, has 2089 reviews and has been on the *Amazon Kindle Store Top 100 list*  three times. ) I want to encourage all abuse victims to follow their dreams, do not let allow your abuser win. What they did to you was not your fault! I recently started a new subreddit r/BreakTheSilence for abuse survivors to tell their stories and support each other.

[ My  Amazon Author Page](https://www.amazon.com/Misty-Elaine-Griffin/e/B00YD19BSO/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0)  has pictures of me when I was 16 years old and still at home with my mother and stepfather. These pictures were taken so that social services would not come out and check up on us. My mother told them it was against our religion to have government officials in our house. They did not question her and took the pictures instead. Note how my stepfather is holding onto our arms in the third picture.

The law was meant to help people in mental health crises, but our investigations revealed glaring flaws in its use on kids. 

Nearly 100 children a day across Florida end up at mental health facilities, with more than 36,000 placed under the Baker Act last year. The state isn't even tracking its use at public schools, so we built a database. We found it's been applied at least 7,500 times in Tampa Bay's public schools since 2013, and probably far more. Most decisions were made by law enforcement with little training instead of mental health professionals. An expert says the Baker Act is abused statewide and used as a way to get kids out of school.

One disturbing aspect we learned: Parents and guardians often have no say. We spoke to families where autistic children ended up in police cruisers, despite their individualized education plans and no mental health diagnoses. Families say they were traumatized. Some facilities even put them in harm's way.

j20aky,"We are COVID-19 vaccine researchers, Anna and Paul. After successful trials in mice, we’ve been carrying out the first human trials of a brand-new type of vaccine with the potential to protect a significant proportion of the world’s population. Ask us anything!",13161,0.89,899,2020-09-29 20:00:24,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j20aky/we_are_covid19_vaccine_researchers_anna_and_paul/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j20aky/we_are_covid19_vaccine_researchers_anna_and_paul/,self.IAmA,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"Edit: Thanks for all your questions! We'll be picking up the most upvoted remaining Qs over the next few days. This AMA is part of a wider series of events and online activities taking place this week. Check them out -[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/lates/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/lates/) 

**Our approach:** Our approach to this vaccine is unique, both compared to other teams around the world fighting COVID-19, and to traditional vaccine development. Almost every viral vaccine ever developed involves injecting a small amount of a weakened version of the virus or viral protein into your body. But ours works differently. We are using RNA, the genetic material that encodes the surface “spike” proteins of the coronavirus, and injecting that into people. In this way, we are able to use your body’s cells as a bioreactor to produce the viral protein and hopefully trigger immunity.

The aim of our vaccine is the same as any other - to prep the body's immune system by getting it to create antibodies that will quickly destroy the virus if you become infected. However, there is nothing of the virus inside those spike proteins. Instead they are tricking your immune system into thinking it’s seeing the whole virus to elicit an immune response. The advantage of our vaccine is that we only need a **tiny dose**: 2 million doses can come from a single litre of vaccine as opposed to the 10,000 litres of vaccine that would be required by traditional methods.

**Pushing forward:** Results from initial trials in mice were positive. Antibody levels in the blood of vaccinated mice were higher than those measured in samples of recovered patients leaving a hospital in London. So we are now pushing forward in two ways. Firstly, through human trials to compare placebo groups with vaccinated groups to look for evidence of successful immune responses. Secondly, due to the severity of the global pandemic, we have had to assume success and start plans for mass distribution that will allow us to vaccinate a significant proportion of the world.

We’re taking a unique approach to this too. Rather than partnering with the pharmaceutical industry, we've launched a social enterprise, VacEquity Global Health (VGH) to bring our COVID-19 vaccine to the world. For the UK and low-income countries abroad, VGH will waive royalties and, due to the potency of the vaccine and this business model, we’re hoping to keep the price below **£10 per dose**. This modest cost-plus price will be used to sustain the enterprise’s work, accelerate global distribution and support new research.

During this AMA we would love to discuss what it’s like to work on a vaccine the world is waiting for, how we are ensuring the vaccine is effective but also safe, and the role of vaccines within society beyond COVID-19.

When Savannah was a [pup](https://www.instagram.com/p/7lZeLrFp7K/?taken-by=theworldwalk) I pushed her in my cart. Now she’ll walk thirty miles a day and still be running circles at night. We’ve spent nearly every minute of every day together and from navigating chaotic cities and strange new environments Sav and I are totally in sync. She’s my best bud and absolutely rock solid. (The Dodo recently did [a video on her](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_NdSwnAVtK/).)

I'm walking around the world because of a friend who died at seventeen. Her death led me to understand how fleeting my life was and that I needed to make the most of the short time I had. When I discovered [Karl Bushby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Bushby) the idea of walking around the world stuck in my head as a way to live a full life.

From seventeen to twenty-six I went to college, worked, paid off loans, saved, then set off before I had too much responsibility.

During the first two years of this adventure I walked from New Jersey to Uruguay. I was held up at knife point in Panama, did ayahuasca in the Amazon, and climbed 15,000 feet over the Chilean Andes. The three years since walking The Americas, I was [almost taken out](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorldWalk/photos/a.382245018625792/870555439794745/?type=3&theater) by a bacterial infection, needed seven months to recover, then walked Europe, North Africa, across Turkey and into Georgia. I peregrinated The Camino in Spain, had a twenty-four hour police escort through Algeria, visited the village of my family name (Turčić) in Croatia and became the first private citizen granted permission to cross the Bosphorus Bridge on foot (the Istanbul bridge crosses from Europe to Asia).

After flying home this winter to obtain extended visas for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Savannah and I returned to the road this March but were promptly forced to put our walk on hold. Currently we're in lockdown in Baku, Azerbaijan so I thought this would be the perfect moment for an AMA.

This [infographic](http://theworldwalk.com/infographic/) on my site provides a great visualization of our walk.

And [this video](https://www.facebook.com/Sunrise/videos/311540596150551/) from Sunrise Australia provides the best summation of our journey.

If you'd like to follow along I do my best to post photos daily and write a weekly(ish) blog post.

Donut Operator here (known as BaconOpinion on Reddit)

I am an American police officer who is on a SWAT team! 
If someone tried to SWAT me, it wouldn't work out too well.

I have been a police officer for a few years now with military before that.

I currently stream on twitch.tv/donutoperator (mostly CS:GO) with my followers. I've been streaming for about a month now and making stupid youtube videos for a few months ( https://youtube.com/c/donutoperatorofficial )

I made it to the front page a while back with the kitten on my shoulder ( http://i.imgur.com/9FskUCg.jpg ) and made it to the top of the CS:GO sub reddit thanks to Lex Phantomhive about a month ago.

I started this AMA after seeing Keemstar swatting someone earlier today (like a huge douche). There were a lot of questions in the comments about SWAT teams and police with people answering them who I'm sure aren't police officers or members of a SWAT team.

SO go ahead and ask me anything! Whether it be about the militarization of police or CS:GO or anything else, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

**My Proof:** https://youtu.be/RSBDUw_c340


*EDIT: 0220- I made it to the front page with Ethan! H3h3 is my favorite channel and I'm right here below them. Sweet.

**EDIT: 0310- If you are a streamer/ youtuber and you are kind of ""iffy"" about contacting your local department, I will be making a bulletin for law enforcement agencies about swatting and would be more than happy to send your local department one. Shoot me a message if you need help with this.

***EDIT: 0420- Hitting the hay people. It was fun! I came here to clear up some misconceptions about police and SWAT teams and I think for the most part I helped you fine people out. I'll answer a few more questions on here tomorrow and you can always reach me on my youtube channel.

For those few people that told me to die, you hope someone chops my head off, you hope someone finds my family, etc... work on getting some help for yourselves and have a nice night. "

EDIT#1

I am seeing people telling others that masks are not helpful. THIS IS NOT TRUE.  HOW TO USE MASKS :

FFP2 and FFP3 masks if wear properly stop the virus. masks have sizes, just like gloves, and they need to well-fit the face to work correctly.

surgical masks are a low level protection, mainly protect others from the one that use them.

ffp2 and ffp3 masks are rare right now and health workers need them the most. do not buy them if you don't need them.

82yyiw,"Hey! I'm James Cordrey, the guy that brought you Drunk Christmas Cards! Now I'm doing something crazier: Running for State Representative in Missouri. Ask me Anything!",12974,0.79,1135,2018-03-08 22:23:03,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/82yyiw/hey_im_james_cordrey_the_guy_that_brought_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/82yyiw/hey_im_james_cordrey_the_guy_that_brought_you/,self.IAmA,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Well hello there!

I'm [James Cordrey](https://www.facebook.com/ElectJamesCordrey/posts/435510173536060), and I'm running in Missouri's 109th representative district.

You might remember me from some of my other Reddit posts - like [Drunk Christmas Cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/7e8v5h/offer_the_drunk_christmas_card_extravaganza/), or maybe [The time I found and played this cool Batman Arcade Game](https://imgur.com/a/kwKIY) or perhaps, even, [My D&D posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4v1xba/how_to_build_your_world_part_one/).

Or maybe you've never heard of me before, and you're just now getting to meet me. Let me tell you some things about me, and what I care about. Then we'll get to the heart of the matter: Your questions.

I'm 31 years old. For a few more days, anyway. I like to read, write, and program small things that are useless to pretty much anyone who is not me. I'm a software developer for a medium sized company, I own my own small business, and I am currently going to school for a BS in Software Development. So, of course, right now was the perfect time to jump into politics, right?

I grew up bouncing around from place to place, but a recurring location was my grandfather's farm. I learned the value of a hard day's work, and what it really means to be a steward of the land. That respect for our planet, and the people living here, is probably the biggest push for me in running for office. I believe that people deserve every opportunity to live decent lives, charted by their own desires, thoughts and ambitions. Nobody should have a life ""forced"" on them based on where they were born, or the economic status of their parents.

This campaign isn't against anything; not directly. I'm not running ""against"" the Republicans, and I'm certainly not running against a specific person. I'm running for something. To help provide opportunities for all students to have access to a truly excellent education system. Farmers should find it easier to sell the product of their toil in marketplaces, without fear of large corporate farms undercutting them and driving them out of business. People are the heart of this campaign, and I want to run for *everyone* in the 109th district.

So. Where can you find out a little more about me? Well. My [Campaign Page](http://www.facebook.com/electjamescordrey) is a good place to start, and you can then jump over to my [Website](http://www.jamescordrey.com) to learn a bit more about me. I can also be found on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JamesCordrey) and [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/jamesccordrey) if those are more your style. Of course, you can skip all of that and just ask your questions here. I'll do my very absolute best to skip the normal political non-answers and give you as honest, and thorough of an answer as I can. If there's one thing we know about Redditors, it's that we can hold people to a higher standard, am I right?

If you're interested in donating to my campaign, (and you live in the United States) you can find the form for that [here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/elect-james-cordrey-1).

... That was really long-winded. Sorry. Ask me your questions!

Edit: WOOF! That was a lot of questions, and I see I have, at this point, 34 more comments ready to go! I've gotta go for a bit, but you better believe I'll be back to answer those messages. (And if I missed one, reach out to me via PM on Facebook or here, and I'll get to it.)

Thanks guys, you've been great, and I'm glad I got some tough questions! You were wonderful. 

Remember to register to vote, wherever you are, and make your voices heard.

Edit 2: Came back last night to answer more questions, then back again this morning to pick up the stragglers. You guys had a lot of really good questions, and they weren't easy, fluffy questions either! Thank you so much for your support, and thank you to the people I disagreed with - stay involved! I fully admit I might be wrong some of the time! If you keep talking, providing evidence, and being persuasive, you'll change minds.

Thank you again!"

Ask me anything!

I am calling on Congress to pass a Child Rights act here in the United States in order to put protections in place for all children, including those in ultra strict religious circles. I am looking for journalists, bloggers etc. who would want to help me get the word out about the petition. My hope is to get millions of signatures and do a Child Rights march in D.C this fall. I have already been to Capitol Hill and spoken to one sitting member of congress. This member of congress was interested but said I had to get the American people behind this in order for congress to listen.

If you are a journalist/blogger, have a website or know of anyone who is or does I would be most grateful for any help in getting this petition in front of the American people. Nothing of significance will ever change if we don't band together and fight for it. Children in religious circles are invisible to the outside world and have no where to turn for help. Children in general have no rights in USA, not really, none that are enforced for all children across the board. They cannot demand change on their behalf, we must do it for them.

eq0310,I'm Scott from Scott's Cheap Flights. Here to help your 2020 travel resolution & answer all your flight questions for the next 12 hours! AMA,12902,0.85,2275,2020-01-17 18:32:19,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eq0310/im_scott_from_scotts_cheap_flights_here_to_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eq0310/im_scott_from_scotts_cheap_flights_here_to_help/,self.IAmA,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"Thanks to Reddit, I’ve been able to spend the past five years working my dream job: finding cheap flights.

This whole cheap flights adventure was born on Reddit back in [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/). It grew from a hobby to a side-hustle to a full-time job to a company with more than 35 people. Hell, half my coworkers came via Reddit.

(If you're curious you can check out Scott's Cheap Flights [here](https://scottscheapflights.com/), but honestly zero pressure.)

So once a year, I like to take off “work” and devote a full day to fielding all the flight booking-related questions that Redditors have. No half-assed Woody Harrelson AMAs here; whole-ass only. Ask me *anything*.

One reason I love doing this: right now, we’re living in the Golden Age of Cheap Flights, yet so few people know it. It’s never been cheaper to travel overseas as it is today, yet polls show people think flights are getting more, not less, expensive. Part of my job is convincing people that travel is no longer just for the rich; it’s for all of us.

That’s why I get so thrilled when Redditors especially have cheap flight success stories, including:

* [u/junglebook03](https://www.reddit.com/user/junglebook03/)’s $500 roundtrip [honeymoon flights](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/apin5n/in_search_of_honeymoon_destination/egkpooz/?context=3) to Paris
* [u/turkeybone](https://www.reddit.com/user/turkeybone/) traveling internationally for the [first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/dlxx7l/lateblooming_solo_traveler/f4vc4xr/?context=3) at 37 and taking a dozen trips since
* (my personal favorite) [u/dickspace](https://www.reddit.com/user/dickspace/)’s [drunken purchase](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/b3pbg1/why_did_you_decide_to_visit_thailand/ej21fo1/?context=3) of a $389 roundtrip flight from LAX to Bangkok

I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we had some sadness this year ending service for folks who live outside the US, and I heard from a number of Redditors who were disappointed. It was an excruciating decision, made all the more difficult as a bootstrapped company (i.e. funded by members, not investors). Still sad, though I’m hoping it’s less a goodbye and more a see you later.

Ask me anything!",12883,0.82,2113,2021-12-19 01:46:21,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rjflos/i_am_the_ceo_of_new_culture_we_make_real_dairy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rjflos/i_am_the_ceo_of_new_culture_we_make_real_dairy/,self.IAmA,0,17,,text,False,False,False,"I'm Matt Gibson, I co-founded [New Culture](https://www.newculturefood.com) with Inja Radman. We are a startup that uses precision fermentation to make real dairy proteins with microbes. We then use those dairy proteins to make delicious dairy cheese that has all the cheesiness you would expect from any conventional animal-derived cheese but with none of the environmental, ethical, or unwanted ingredient (lactose, cholesterol) drawbacks.

The reason why we're starting with cheese is that it is by far the [most unsustainable](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food) dairy product in terms of GHG emissions, land usage and water usage. But what makes cheese even worse is that fact that the sustainable cheese alternatives (plant-based cheeses) do such a poor job at replicating the dairy cheese experience that no mainstream cheese consumer is buying them. Plant-based cheese has captured less then 1% of the US cheese market compared to plant-based milk that has captured \~15%. This is obviously a big problem due to how unsustainable dairy cheese ise

What we discovered is that dairy proteins, specifically casein protein, are responsible for all the cheese attributes we love, think about the stretch and melt of mozzarella, the crumbliness of feta, the crumbliness of parmesan, the gooeniss of brie - that is all due to casein protein. So if we can make animal-free casein with fermentation, we can make a delicious cheese with all the other ingrediants remaining plant-based (sugars, fats). And that's exactly what we are doing

Our first cheese is mozzarella for pizza and we are already making a lot of it :) We are planning to launch in pizzeria's in 2023 but also have showcases of our cheese next year

In August 2016 I began walking from near Toronto, Canada where I live. It took me 322 days to get from there to San Francisco. Along the way I visited 18 states and wore out 8 pairs of shoes. More importantly I met so many incredible people who showed me great kindness and hospitality. With what we hear about this world you'd think I would have had trouble with people at every turn, but just about everyone I met was awesome! 

That last trip was all about me, this trip is about me and my best friend raising money for Alzheimer research! Our plan is to cycle 8,000km over the course of roughly 100 days. To be completely honest, we have very little cycling experience, but we're going to give it our best go.

Long time Redditor, first time AMA’er here. My name is Marissa Orr, and I’m a former Googler and ex-Facebooker turned author. It all started on a Sunday afternoon in March of 2016, when I hit send on an email to Sheryl Sandberg, setting in motion a series of events that ended 18 months later when I was fired from my job at Facebook. Here’s the rest of that story and why it inspired me to write *Lean Out, The Truth About Women, Power, ＆ The Workplace*: https://medium.com/@MarissaOrr/why-working-at-facebook-inspired-me-to-write-lean-out-5849eb48af21 

&nbsp;




Through personal (and humorous) stories of my time at Google and Facebook, Lean Out is an attempt to explain everything we’ve gotten wrong about women at work and the gender gap in corporate America. Here are a few book excerpts and posts from my blog which give you a sense of my perspective on the topic.

It's not a good idea for anyone to consider being a member. I hope from this post and this discussion that people realize that nobody is truly invulnerable to it. Posts like this (I know it's not the first) help to further the massive, but obviously incomplete, awareness about this cult. I can definitely appreciate the skeptics in the comments who have managed to interpret my comments as pro-Scientology, I merely meant to acknowledge the ways that the org can lure people in. To be entirely unambiguous: DON'T JOIN SCIENTOLOGY!!!! I CAN'T BE MORE DIRECT ABOUT IT. DON'T EVEN CHECK IT OUT. HELP YOUR FRIENDS TO AVOID IT OR LEAVE IT. IT IS A CULT. BAAAAAAAD. Please check out documentaries on Scientology at the bottom of the post.

My girlfriend had been a Scientologist for 5+ years and her mom for 15+. I knew about her involvement but we just avoided the conversation, which was easy because she wasn’t actively practicing and we were happy. When things were rocky in Fall 2018, she sought guidance from the Church and then suggested that the “Tech” would help us to get along better. I knew a lot of the bad things people say about Scientology, but I figured looking at her book (Dianetics) couldn’t do harm... then I figured seeing the welcome center at the Church couldn’t do harm... then I figured participating in a 7hr $30 course on Integrity couldn’t do harm... then I figured purchasing a $2500 12.5hr auditing session couldn’t do harm... then another session for myself, then I fronted one for her, and prepurchased the “Purification Rundown” for both of us -- suddenly I had spent $12,000 at the Church of Scientology.

While trying to make my final purchase for $5000 with a credit card, the bank denied it; when I called to authorize it they said that certain organizations had been flagged to protect consumers, because they had a disproportionately large correlation with folks who default on their credit card. This was a red flag that flew over my head, and the financial guys at the church worked diligently to find a paypal loophole.

A major difference between my girlfriend and me was that she kept her involvement in Scientology a secret. When I began to gain momentum in Scientology and felt it was improving my life, I was eager to tell my friends; this ended up being the key to helping me get out. My friends say that my mind was so open it could fall out, but that meant it was also easy to put back in. I have never been religious in any capacity and I tend to be a hardcore skeptic and technical thinker, but there appears to be real and exciting value when you are starting off in Scientology. It makes you feel important and capable of growth. A yearning to have a meaningful life, an overcommitment to a sinking relationship, and a well-designed cult nearly became a concoction for losing my family, my money and my sense of self.

I’ve spent the last few months attempting to get my money back and it has been a doozy. The organization is designed like a chinese fingertrap for its money and its members, and I’ve learned a few things in the process. I may have advice for recent defectors (believe me it’s common) who are trying to repair their life and finances. The silver bullet for me ended up being disputing the transactions with my credit card companies, on the basis of being denied the refund they offer within 90 days. I would have been squashed or led on if I tried to solicit my money legally from the Church, but by disputing the transaction and providing evidence to the credit card companies, I placed the ball in their court and they let the challenge period (60 days) expire. I have all $12k back now!

TL;DR girlfriend got me into Scientology despite my scientific disposition, I advertised it to my friends who intervened, and I was able to get my money back via credit card disputes

My analytics career has been extremely varied, I have used analysis to locate and neutralize terrorist cells, break drug rings, and even break out of prison…twice! I have used analytics to advise governments on strategic actions and also businesses on possible mergers and acquisitions.  
 
Sun Tzu once said (loosely) to know yourself and know your enemy is the key to victory, and data analytics is the window to BOTH of those pursuits. The art and science of data analytics can take you as far as you are able to creatively apply the principles of pattern recognition and predictive analysis, and I can assure you, these principles work!
 
I currently advise in Data Analytics for Grant Thornton, LLP, an advisory firm that helps large and mid-size companies grow and thrive in this dynamic economy. I am also an analytics chief within the military reserves, where I lead teams of analysts in their assessment of strategic and operational scenarios and mission sets. I am happy to answer questions on either role, but I will be careful not to delve into classified matters. 
 
I would also like to thank Western Digital’s [DataMakesPossible.com](https://www.datamakespossible.com/) website for suggesting this session, as I truly agree, data and its interpretation can make all the difference in the world!

8wct8k,"I was born and raised in a NY Hasidic community, completely isolated from Secular society. AMA",12807,0.86,4608,2018-07-05 23:56:34,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8wct8k/i_was_born_and_raised_in_a_ny_hasidic_community/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8wct8k/i_was_born_and_raised_in_a_ny_hasidic_community/,self.IAmA,0,3,,text,False,False,False,"As the title says, I was born and raised in the Hasidic community. For those of you that are unfamiliar what Hasidim are, the Hasidic community is a very religious and traditional community, with a lot of strict rules and customs. There’s a very big focus on staying isolated and not letting in any outside secular influences, which in result creates a very tight nit and family oriented community. 
Almost everything in our lifestyle is completely different from regular society. From the biggest thing in life, like family, marriage, education, language etc, to the most little ones like, which shirt you’re allowed to wear, or which number blade you’re allowed to cut your hair. 
There’s so much interesting experiences and observations that I can write about. It probably requires a whole book. But I’ll leave it up for your questions! 

Thanks for reading!

Ps. I’m not in the position to put my face in public so the IAmA mods have verified my authenticity confidentiality. 

Edit 1: I thought I might get some questions but I wasn’t expecting sooo much so fast. I really thank you for your interest and asking questions!
English is not my first language and I’ve never formally learned to write English well. It takes me long to respond, but I’ll try to answer every question slowly. I’ll be back in a hour or two. 

Edit 2: I was out for a while and just checked back in, I’m speechless. I really do appreciate each and everyone that responds, I really want to answer every single comment. (I’m usually on the other end where I wait for the OP to respond) I feel like I want to grab a mic and scream shhhh, I’ll get to you all, just one at a time. But as of now I don’t see a mic button on the app. 

It seems that if I answer the top question that already have hundreds of sub comments, my answer gets buried on the bottom. I think I’ll try for now to answer the newer ones and see how that works. Thank you guys!

Edit 3: I’m still trying to answer your questions and I will try to continue in the next few days. 

There has been a few people that had some interesting ideas and some even mentioned that they would want to meet. I don’t know if that can happen so fast but I would like stay in touch. I’m having a hard time finding a lot of people between thousands of messages. I figured I will create an email account and maybe it will be  easier to manage. Redditama2018@gmail.com

Hope this doesn’t violate any rules, if it does I will take it down. 

Thanks you guys again!

\--------------------

[South Africa's homicide rate per capita is currently the 10th highest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate), nearly 5x higher than that of the United States. I grew up in Johannesburg from 1992-1999 - during this time, [it was twice as bad as it is now.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_South_Africa)

As a child, I grew up constantly hearing of harrowing personal accounts from family friends who were carjacked and robbed at gun point. The government would run advertisements on television advising people to not stop for traffic lights at night unless absolutely necessary.

The flats we lived in had 3 levels of security - a spiked metal fence for the complex, steel reinforced doors for the unit, and another layer of steel reinforced doors to go upstairs where the bedrooms were.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when one of our close family friends was fatally shot in his own home during an intrusion.

My mother decided to take a leap of faith and bring me and my sister to the United States on an H-1B visa paying a relatively meager wage. We were evicted from my aunt's house after 3 months, and another relative took us in until my mother could afford our own apartment.

9 years in the Marine Corps and an MBA later, I decided to tackle an issue that I am deeply passionate about and started a company that develops AI software to automatically identify gun threats. We have now raised over $10 million of venture funding and have our technology deployed on nearly 20,000 cameras across over 1,200 buildings and sites.

I realize that technology alone won't come remotely close to solving gun violence, but it is our hope that our small group of thoughtful and committed citizens can move the needle in a meaningful way.

Have I missed anyone's questions so far? If I have let me know or re-ask and I will get to it. I hope all you wonderful dad's are enjoying your day with the kiddos!

I also added in why I needed a face transplant as I have ben asked that many times.


Edit- added a public album and links to other things and my old AMA

My name is Mitch Hunter, I did an AMA a few years back and decided to update my fellow redditors on my progress. I have healed quite well over the last few years and most people can hardly tell I even had a face transplant. 

All the sensation in my face is back 100% and it feels awesome! I have recently been on local news in many cities, BBC Live Radio, and Good Morning Britain. 

I could type forever but this is an AmA so ask away and like last time, I will answer every question you have!

Since I've been asked ""why did you need a face transplant, I'll clear that up with this edit. 

I was in a car accident that involved a truck hitting a utility pole. The driver got out shut the door and pretty much left his girlfriend and I in the truck for dead. We eventually got out and from I was told by her and eye witnesses, she was struck by one of the downed power lines. I got her off the downed line immediately, then it struck and grounded me. 10,000 volts 7 amps for about 5 mins. It entered my left leg, exited my right hand, and face. I also suffered a few major and minor blowouts, one on my left chest above my heart, left shoulder, and down the left arm. I had full thickness burns (past third degree) on the majority of my face, I have a BKA (below knee amputation) on the left leg, and I lost two fingers on the right hand (ring and pinkie). I was in the hospital two and a half months after the accident and in and out for four more years. I've had 70-80 surgeries on my face and hand, the majority on my face. Add about 10-15 more on my leg, I never got the records on my leg, so that's more of a guess. The accident was 11/30/01.

I Am Andy Josuweit, CEO and co-founder of [Student Loan Hero](https://studentloanhero.com). My relationship with debt started seven years ago after graduating from an expensive private school with $74,000 in student loans. 

I was told I would earn about $80k upon graduation, but I wasn’t able to find a job with a salary anywhere near that. Without steady income (and a terrible economy in 2009), I ended up defaulting on my student loans and my balance ballooned to $107,000. 

Building Student Loan Hero allowed me to help people who struggled in the same way I did. After a seven-year-long journey, I finally paid off my student loans (in full) three months ago. All $107,000! Now that my debt is officially behind me, I thought it’d be the perfect opportunity to share some insight into my six-figure payoff story. 

Our free tools, calculators, and guides are helping 100,000+ borrowers manage and eliminate over $2 billion dollars in student loan debt. Ready to ROCK this AMA!

**Update:** You guys are awesome! Obviously, I can’t get to all your questions. If you're still looking for help, feel free to [check out our website here](https://studentloanhero.com/) where you can get free repayment advice and find answers to your student loan questions. I will be wrapping this up around 5 pm EST.

**Final Update:** Thanks for having me! I'm exhausted, so time to call it quits. Many folks had the same questions, so I'll answer them here: 

1) SLH makes money the same way that Bankrate, NerdWallet, and CreditKarma do via performance-based advertising. This means we earn a commission when a customer decides to apply for a product/service. Everything on SLH is 100% free for users, although we do have some tools that allow you to ""Pay What You Want"" (and anyone can decide to pay $0 if he/she wishes).

2) There is some confusing language in our [Terms of Use](https://studentloanhero.com/terms-of-use/). I realize that this outdated. Just to be clear, we have never rented/sold/leased any customer data nor do we plan on doing so in the future. Our team will be updating this legal language ASAP.

3) Lastly, there is no magic bullet when paying off debt. It takes hard work, patience, and determination. I simply hope to make student loan repayment less confusing with some simple tools and resources that anyone is free to use.

Thanks everyone for sharing your stories/questions/and feedback! If you have any additional questions, you can always email our team here: support@studentloanhero.com"

I’m Adam Moelis.  I'm the co-founder of [Yotta Savings](https://www.withyotta.com/), a 100% free app that uses behavioral psychology to help people save money by making saving exciting.  For every $25 deposited into an FDIC-insured Yotta Savings account, users get a recurring ticket into our weekly random number drawings with chances to win prizes ranging from $0.10 to the $10 million jackpot.  Even if you don't win a prize, you still get paid over 2x the national average on your savings.  A [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/say-no-no-lose-lottery-rebroadcast/) podcast has described prize-linked savings accounts as a ""no-lose lottery"".

As a personal finance and behavioral psychology nerd (Nudge, Thinking Fast and Slow, etc.), I was excited by the idea of building a product that could help people, but that also had business potential.  I stumbled across a pair of statistics; 40% of Americans can’t come up with $400 for an emergency & the average household spends over $640 every year on the lottery.   Yotta Savings was the product of my reconciling of those two stats.

As part of building Yotta Savings, I spent a ton of time studying how lotteries and scratch tickets across the country work, consulting with behind-the-scenes state lottery employees, and working with PhDs on understanding the psychology behind why people play the lottery despite it being such a sub-optimal financial decision.

Your donations will directly help 3000 people get solar electricity, and contribute to a model that has the ambition to solve the electricity access crisis for good in a sustainable and economically sound way.
Thank you!

**My short bio:** I am the founder of [Power:On](https://en.turnthepoweron.co). My startup built an independent electric grid for 3000 people in 2015 and now we want to upgrade to solar energy and replicate what we did to solve the electricity access crisis for millions of people.

EDIT1: If you wish to support, just watch the film and share! I need 20,000 email sign ups to be able to launch a crowdfunding campaign!

EDIT2: A lot of people are raising legitimate questions about the charity business and the project's sustainability. Please note this is precisely why we chose to make Power:On a startup and not a NGO! 
Please read questions and answers about that, and I'm off course happy to give more details!

EDIT3: Dear Redditors, I wanted to thank you all for being so many to ask questions. I truly did not expect such a success (we even were on the front page at one time)!! As a thank you, I wanted to offer you a free copy of an ebook, just for you guys. It's a collection of our ""Humans Of Igbérè"" series (inspired from the famous ""Humans Of New York""). You'll get to walk a mile in the shoes of the inhabitants from the village where Power:On built its first electrical grid, and get to hear what they have to say. These stories are what motivates me to do what I do, and I truly hope you will enjoy them too. 
To get the ebook, you will only have to sign up with an email. You will be able to unsubscribe at any time (I hate spam as much as you do), even though I hope you will stay with us and be a part of our journey to keep posted of what we do. Enough talk, [click here to get your free ebook just for you Redditors](https://film.turnthepoweron.co/)
I'll still be here if you have more questions! Thank you again for your interest and support!

Hey everyone! Jordan Prentice here. I am from Canada and [acting since 1986] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696015/)

Right now I am at the Filmfestival in Munich where we celebrate the premiere of our new kids-movie [“At eye level”] (http://www.filmfest-muenchen.de/en/programm/filme/film/?id=4903) (Auf Augenhöhe)

I felt it would be a good opportunity to do an AMA since there’s been a big discussion recently about the discrimination of people of short stature in Germany. Their campaign is called #KeinZwerg - #NoDwarf and their point is: Talk to us and not only about us! That’s why: AMA!

Btw: I have a german translator beside me who is also transcribing the interview. So, here comes the german text:

Ich bin ein Schauspieler und kleinwüchsig und: Nein, ich bin nicht der Typ aus “Game of Thrones”. Ich bin Jordan Prentice. Ihr kennt mich wahrscheinlich aus “Brügge sehen...und sterben?”. Fragt mich!

Hallo an alle! Hier ist Jordan Prentice. Ich komme aus Kanada und bin [seit 1986 Schauspieler] (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Prentice)

Zur Zeit bin ich auf dem Filmfest München, wo wir die Filmpremiere des Kinderfilms [“Auf Augenhöhe”] (http://www.filmfest-muenchen.de/de/programm/filme/film/?id=4903) feiern.

Ich fand, es wäre eine gute Möglichkeit, ein AMA zu machen, weil es gerade die #KeinZwerg-Aktion in Deutschland gibt, die gegen die Diskriminierung Kleinwüchsiger kämpft. Also, sprecht lieber mit uns und nicht nur über uns, deshalb: AMA - fragt mich alles!

In addition, I was an FBI hostage negotiator for 23 years of my career, retiring as the Chief of the FBI’s Crisis Negotiation Unit, Critical Incident Response Group, the first person to hold that position. In that capacity I was heavily involved in numerous crisis incidents covering prison riots, right-wing militia standoffs, religious zealot sieges, terrorist embassy takeovers, airplane hijackings, and over 120 overseas kidnapping cases involving American citizens. In my book, Stalling for Time, I take readers on a harrowing tour through many of the most famous hostage crises in the history of the modern FBI, including the siege at Waco, the Montana Freemen standoff, and the D.C. sniper attacks. Having helped develop the FBI’s nonviolent communication techniques for achieving peaceful outcomes in tense situations, I offer a candid, fascinating look back at my years as an innovator in the ranks of the Bureau and a pioneer on the front lines.

2spmgu,My climbing partners and I were kidnapped and held hostage for a week before we conspired to throw a guy off a cliff to escape. AMA!,12564,0.84,3030,2015-01-17 11:30:22,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2spmgu/my_climbing_partners_and_i_were_kidnapped_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2spmgu/my_climbing_partners_and_i_were_kidnapped_and/,self.IAmA,0,1,,text,False,,False,"In August of 2000, I went on a rock climbing expedition to the mountains of Kyrgyzstan. Asleep on the side of a mountain, my three partners and I were rudely awoken by some men shooting at us. We were subsequently taken captive and held hostage for a week before we conspired to grab our then-lone guard and throw him off a cliff. Actually, Tommy Caldwell - of the current Dawn Wall fame - did the tossing. My other two partners were Beth Rodden and John Dickey.

Although not exactly accurate in the strictest sense, this is the most concise version of the events that is currently available:

The guy we threw off the cliff, Su miraculously survived (I will never understand how) and John and I saw him six months later in prison. He was overjoyed to see us because we were the nicest people he had seen since the last time he had seen us. The conversation itself was somewhat awkward and we both apologized to each other and exchanged well-wishes.

A year later, in 2001, I had an even worse climbing trip when I was struck by rockfall on a remote mountain in the Canadian Arctic (Mt. Asgard, accompanied by Cedar Wright). After 57 hours camp-to-camp with no sleep and an immobilized left leg, I was feeling pretty unwell. On the 50km walk back to the ocean I started experiencing hallucinations and nightmares and was unable to figure out what was reality. Two weeks after I got home the events of 9/11 transpired and I, not ready to see Americans lose their minds about terrorism, got on a plane to Asia, fell off the planet for over a decade. I tried to forget everything I thought I knew, asked myself a lot of questions, and read a lot of books.

Heavily affected by my experiences, I was not a ready or able to be a functioning member of society for a very long time and still struggle a bit. Finally, my wife dragged me kicking and screaming into a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym and my life has been steadily uphill since that first beatdown. I can now say that jiu jitsu saved my life. I don't feel like I have to be afraid of everybody everywhere I go, I can communicate and socialize again, and my confidence and motivation steadily grow as time goes by.

I am now available for speaking engagements to share my story with others and my current contact is: www.jasonsingersmith.com

I am happy to answer all questions that are composed in a thoughtful and respectful fashion.

**EDIT** Since a lot of people ask about how I afford to travel. I had money from the book and movie for about 6 or 7 year, maybe. Money that made me extremely unhappy and that I didn't want in my life. I used to work for a month or two here and there when I would stop in to stay with friends in different places. I am a builder of all things: fabric, wood, masonry, electronics, leather, etc. so I'm just a handy guy to have around. Especially if you have a lot of land that needs work or a house you're working on. I've been in Australia for the last seven years and basically do the same, various odd jobs. We can afford to travel (these days usually three months in the winter) because we are *extremely* frugal. We don't spend money on crap and we don't have debt. Debt costs a lot of money to maintain and ties you down permanently. So the short story is that we have goal, that we know makes us happy, and we save until we get it.

We documented and buried human remains and brought home the cockpit voice recorder and a roll of magnetic tape. 

**The parts of the black box that we recovered are still sitting in my apartment**, as the NTSB and FAA wont analyze the voice recorder until the State Department says it's ok.  *Help us get their attention so they will do the right thing?*

Thank you for joining us!

Original message:
Hey, everyone! We’re Maurice Chammah (u/mauricechammah), a staff writer for [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/about) (u/marshall_project), and Mirya Holman (u/mirya_holman), a political science professor at Tulane University.

If Chuck Jenkins, Joe Arpaio or David Clarke are familiar names to you, you already know the extreme impact on culture and law enforcement sheriffs can have. In some communities, the sheriff can be larger than life — and it can feel like their power is, too. A few years ago, I was interviewing a sheriff in rural Missouri about abuses in his jail, when he said, rather ominously, that if I wrote something “not particularly true” — which I took to mean that he didn’t like — then “I wouldn’t advise you to come back.” The hairs stood up on the back of my neck.

I wondered: Why did this sheriff perceive himself to be so powerful?

Hundreds of sheriffs are on ballots across the country this November, and in an increasingly partisan America, these officials are lobbying lawmakers, running jails and carrying out evictions, and deciding how aggressively to enforce laws. What do you know about the candidates in your area?

Holman and Farris are the undeniable leading scholarly experts on sheriffs. We recently [teamed up on a survey to understand the blend of policing and politics](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/we-surveyed-u-s-sheriffs-see-their-views-on-power-race-and-immigration), hearing from about 1 in 6 sheriffs nationwide, or 500+ sheriffs.

[Among our findings](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/we-surveyed-u-s-sheriffs-see-their-views-on-power-race-and-immigration):

* Many subscribe to a notion popular on the right that, in their counties, their power supersedes that of the governor or the president. (Former Oath Keepers board member [Richard Mack's ""Constitutional sheriff"" movement](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/does-your-sheriff-think-he-s-more-powerful-than-the-president) is an influential reason why.)
* A small, but still significant number, of sheriffs also support far-right anti-government group the Oath Keepers, some of whose members are on trial for invading the U.S. Capitol.
* Most believe mass protests like those against the 2020 police murder of George Floyd are motivated by bias against law enforcement.

Ask us anything!

7us8i2,"After growing up around domestic violence, I have created my own website to raise awareness and share other survivors stories, AMA",12535,0.83,413,2018-02-02 21:28:43,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7us8i2/after_growing_up_around_domestic_violence_i_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7us8i2/after_growing_up_around_domestic_violence_i_have/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"www.writeforadifference.com 
Twitter - @pxnnyroyal_tea
Facebook - Facebook.com/writeforadifference 

For years, my family have been torn apart by the repercussions of domestic violence. For the past few months, I've been struggling to accept the reality of our situation. It's 11 years on, and I often feel like a failure because I still feel no closure after everything that has happened.When I was at school, teachers that were aware of what was going on would tell me that one day I would end up writing a book or doing something positive with my own experience. As the years have progressed, this has become harder and harder to motivate myself towards. I have had numerous conversations with social work regarding my concerns, written a lot of letters and even started a petition at one point. Each time, I have been pushed back or made to feel like a crazy and traumatised child. I am an adult now, but after being silenced and ignored so many times, it has become harder and harder to fight back and I have questioned my own sanity over the years.

1,031,120 - is the number of domestic violence incidents reported in England and Wales during 2016. Just ONE year. I’m always uncomfortable sharing personal things, but when there’s a chance to make a difference and bring about change by telling a story I think that’s more important than my own fears. Some of you might remember a petition I created years ago, I must have only been about 14/15 at the time. My brother, sister and I were placed into the care of my grandmother after living in a home of domestic violence for several years. I started a petition because social work wanted to send my brother and sister back to live with my mother and her partner as they said they had no evidence the violence was still ongoing. The reason they had no evidence it was still ongoing is because my mum was under his control and would cover up what was really happening and I had hoped they would listen to my concerns and acknowledge the risk in sending my extremely young brother and sister back to live in this home. I was thrilled when my petition gained 1495 signatures and a lot of support from the public and messages from people opening up to me with similar experiences.

Sadly, social work ignored my petition and I was told that I could be in trouble with the police for my petition if I didn’t take it down and shortly afterwards social work went through with their decision to send them back to live with my mother and my violent step-dad. As a young teenager it took a lot of courage to speak out and I think having my concerns ignored by professionals for years and years has made me more fearful of speaking out as an adult and eventually I lost faith in social work’s ability to protect children.

Sadly, earlier on this year it was revealed that the violence has in fact continued on for years. However, my mum finally made the choice to leave my step-dad and charge him for everything he has done. The police have had the polar opposite approach of social work. Now there is a chance he may go to prison for the things he has done.I think it speaks volumes about the system that the police can hear about the horrible things this man has done and think there is a chance he could be locked up because he is a dangerous man whereas the social work department seen a suitable home for children. 

Their decision to send them back allowed this violence to continue on in the presence of my younger brother and sister for years. It’s time the social work department stop playing happy families and putting their targets/budget before the well-being of the children they are supposed to protect.The whole system is a disgrace and it has taken a lot of courage to share this story but I hope if enough people speak out then it will bring about change and encourage people who have been in similar circumstances to speak out and get angry until it can’t be ignored. If you see/hear something that makes you worry about somebody’s wellbeing then don’t ignore it - report it to somebody. 

Things can’t go on like this.I am hoping by starting this blog and sharing my own concerns and experiences over the years, I may not only raise awareness and help someone else but may find some closure through writing about it.

EDIT: Grabbing a cup of tea and then I'll work through all the questions and make sure I answer everything. I'm not feeling well so will be spending the night in bed with my laptop so keep the questions coming, I'll be here all night to get through them. :) 

EDIT 2: I am so overwhelmed by this response, I was not expecting this kind of feedback and all of you have made my evening and made me feel even more confident that I'm doing the right thing by starting this website. Like I mentioned in a lot of my comments, I am very new to all this and still getting used to things but I hope you'll all keep up to date with my posts and remember, if there is anything you would like to share then you can get in touch. Also, if anybody has any tips for building up a regular readership, that would be great. "

In 2017 we [occupied a mansion](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/27/squatters-open-oligarchs-empty-london-property-as-homeless-shelter) in Belgravia belonging to the obscure oligarch [Andrey Goncharenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Goncharenko) and turned it into a homeless shelter for just over a week.

Given the recent attempted liberation of properties in both [London](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/squatters-russian-oligarch-london-mansion-b2036170.html) and [France](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/activists-arrested-france-occupying-villa-linked-russian-oligarch-2022-03-14/) I thought it'd be cool to share my own experiences of occupying an oligarchs mansion, squatting, and life in general so for the next few hours AMA!

I've gotta run, everyone! Thank you so much for this—I had a blast answering your questions. (Great questions, people!) You made my first Reddit experience an incredibly positive one.

Just remember: Accent is identity. Accent is a layer of storytelling. It's (almost) never the actor's fault when an accent isn't what it should it be. It's usually about not having adequate prep time. (Tell the producers and studio heads!)

When I signed off yesterday at 6PM PST, this AMA only had 300 comments and I did my best to make sure all the top questions were answered (as well as some fun and obscure questions).

He disappeared and we later discovered that he was accused of espionage because he corresponded with his parents in Romania. Our family became labeled as “enemies of the people” and we were banned from our town. I spent the next few years as a starving refugee working on a collective farm in Kazakhstan with my mother and baby brother. When the war ended, we escaped to Poland and then West Germany. I ended up in Munich where I was able to attend the technical university. After becoming a citizen of the United States in 1955, I worked on the Titan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Launcher and later started an engineering company that I have been working at for the past 46 years.  I wrote a memoir called “A Red Boyhood: Growing Up Under Stalin”, published by University of Missouri Press, which details my experiences living in the Soviet Union and later fleeing. I recently taught a course at the local community college entitled “The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire” and I am currently writing the sequel to A Red Boyhood titled “America Through the Eyes of an Immigrant”.

luvt2l,I'm a 36yo who has had bowel cancer and had 2 colonoscopies without any sedation then 2 surgeries to completely remove my bowel and sew my butt shut.

-

Originally my GP thought it was an ulcer as it was just a lot of blood when I went to the toilet, I had to have a colonoscopy done to check it and because I have no family they don't let you drive yourself home if they use sedation so went without it. Was told I had cancer while on the recovery bed and then went full testing, Surgeon wanted specific marks tattooed in my bowel for the main surgery so another colonoscopy and got 5 X's tattooed inside me.

-

First surgery was to remove a tumour, which I had to do bowel prep for (which is horrible) but on recovery from that they told me they found a lot more cancer and I'd have to have my entire bowel removed. Another surgery were they took out 5 feet of bowel/intestines and now I have a Stoma for the rest of my life, I wear a bag always for it and have had to learn to adjust (as personally I find it disgusting) but it's better than cancer is all I keep telling myself.

-

I now have to have a full range of tests every 6 months for the rest of my life and have been told 'it will be back one day' just no way to know when, they said if I was 80+ this would be normal but for my age it's very rare. These days I feel like death is chasing me and am just trying to stay ahead of it.

Thought I'd add this too as one of the complications I've gone through since surgery and another possible warning of 'gross' there is hundreds of different bags and such and what comes out of my intestines actually causes a chemical burn if it touches the skin, so I ended up with second degree chemical burns around the stoma as it was pointing down so they had to try a lot of different bags till found a good one for me (thankfully they did). https://imgur.com/jO5read

Edit: So a few have asked what my butt looks like now, honestly I'd been curious but never looked for myself either, but hey it's reddit.

It all began on Reddit [8 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2zpz7j/i_flew_from_nyc_to_milan_for_65_now_i_help_people/) after I found a $130 roundtrip flight to Milan, and because I lack creative genius I gave my email list the most obvious name I could think of: Scott’s Cheap Flights.

Eight years later, I’m titillated for what that little startup has now become: [Going](https://going.com/).

**Rebrand Stuff**

Look, the name Scott’s Cheap Flights worked great when it was just me. But today there are 65 people on the team (and [hiring](https://going.com/careers)) and it is immensely unfair and embarrassing and guilt-inducing every time a member writes in “thanks Scott!” for a cheap flight that 64 of my teammates helped them get.

So we decided to switch to a new look and name that’s about all of us, not just one person.

Our mission to help people travel more and stop overpaying for flights is still the same. And the best part of my workday is hearing those real-life cheap flights success stories, especially from Redditors including: (all fares below are roundtrip, not Spirit)

* [u/Thedishwasher3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/ynkisa/comment/iv9xvvw/) Tokyo for $490 nonstop
* [u/Actuarial\_type](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zv9q3x/comment/j1onzvf/) Amsterdam for $410
* [u/Travelmore\_magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/ynwu4c/comment/ivci06j/) Paris for $350
* [u/Worldly\_Economist686](https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/comments/103txzm/comment/j35nh69/) Greece for $480

(If we’ve helped you get a cheap flight, let me know! I want to celebrate you.)

I know rebrands can be polarizing—I don’t begrudge anyone who wishes it stayed SCF. I genuinely want to hear your thoughts about Going, the logo, the new look. Even negative feedback is welcome; it shows you care. The team has been working *extremely* hard for months, and we’re so excited to finally share with y’all.

(One final note I’d be remiss not to mention: If anyone had license to be upset about the name change it’s me, Scott, and I’m ecstatic about it.)

**Cheap Flights Stuff**

You may not care at all about the rebrand and just here to talk cheap flights and I hear you! It’s my favorite topic too. Ask me about:

* my [2022 travel predictions](https://scottscheapflights.com/guides/travel-predictions-for-2022) (I went 12 for 17, a gentleman’s C)
* my [13 travel predictions for 2023](https://scottscheapflights.com/guides/travel-predictions-for-2023)
* how flights are getting cheaper after last summer’s surge
* whether cookies/incognito browsers change fares
* what days are cheapest for flights
* what Goldilocks Windows are and why they’re the secret to cheap flights
* the most common flight myths/misconceptions
* my favorite deals we found members in 2022 (all roundtrip, not Spirit)
   * Hawaii $177 from west coast, $399 from NYC
   * Costa Rica $207
   * Tokyo $316
   * Paris $248 (record low)

My ship has been fighting for weeks with the CDC and the US government to let me back into the country, even though I am a US citizen.

EDIT: ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS

* Am I being paid? No.

* Have you filed for unemployment? My internet is not strong enough yet. I'm going to try as soon as I get back on land.

* Is anyone onboard sick? No. Or at least, they have not made any announcements about that. Everyone is getting fever tested twice a day.

* How's the food? A bit lower than guest quality, but generally good. [Here's a picture of dinner!](https://imgur.com/a/nFjZoOm) 

* How do you get food? They deliver it to me three meals a day.

* How's the room? It is a 200sq ft cabin to myself. I spend around 20+ hours a day in here alone. I have a balcony and a double bed. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/hjwOymp)

* How much is the internet? it's $10 per gigabyte, and the connection is extremely spotty. It drops out usually every 20 and 30 minutes for me, and takes a few minutes to pick back up again. Even phone calls over WhatsApp are hard to make.

* Why don't you jump? It is incredibly dangerous to jump overboard a moving ship. If you jump over the side, there is a good chance that the current drags you underneath the ship and into the propellers. If you jump over the back, the water is heavily aerated and you will get sucked under again. If you manage to swim to the top / hold your breath long enough, you will die of dehydration and exposure if you don't make it to land.

* What happened when you tried to leave the ship? [longer comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gfc3p7/i_am_a_cruise_ship_worker_currently_trapped_at/fpt5vfl)

A lot has been written over the last 20 years about OxyContin and its role in the nation’s prescription drug epidemic. But our investigation uncovered something totally new.

The drug maker Purdue Pharma launched OxyContin two decades ago with a bold marketing claim: One dose relieves pain for 12 hours, more than twice as long as generic medications. On the strength of that promise, OxyContin became America’s bestselling painkiller, and Purdue reaped more than $31 billion in revenue.

But our investigation found that OxyContin’s stunning success masked a fundamental problem: The drug wears off hours early in many people, exposing them to painful symptoms of withdrawal and an increased risk of addiction.

--------

Hi Reddit!

As coronavirus started to spread across the country earlier this year, measuring that spread proved nearly impossible. Without a single source tracking new cases at a granular level, understanding COVID-19’s growth would be difficult.

But gathering the resources to make a tracking map was also difficult. Local governments have disparate methods for collecting and reporting data. For all the numbers on cases and deaths to end up standardized in one place, a bespoke data solution needed to be built from the ground up. USAFacts started making phone calls and scraping data from county websites. The result was one of the first county-level COVID-19 tracker in the US.

The USAFacts Coronavirus Hub is now being used by Dr. Deborah Birx and the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses our data to power the county maps on its own website. Dozens more government entities at all levels use it, and nonprofits like Feeding America consult it to determine where the need for nutritional assistance is greatest.

We are the product team from USAFacts. Ask us anything about aggregating data from hundreds of county, regional, and state governments, plus how our coronavirus data is being used!

TL;DR: At my first real job out of college doing econometrics for a minor league hockey team, I had an idea for an app but didn’t know how to code and couldn’t afford to pay someone to program it for me. I bought four books off Amazon and spent the next few months learning how to program. Within 10 months, I got a prototype off the ground and sold it to a few big colleges. It was a synchronized [smartphone light show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ork4Q4eoUg4). It was adopted by fans quickly and soon started to spread throughout into the NBA, NHL, concerts, and even corporate events for companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Nissan.

What makes the app unique or special is that that it doesn't use WiFi, Bluetooth, or Cell Service; instead, I designed a mechanism for network-free data transfer using inaudible, ultrasonic sound waves. This ultrasonic transmission protocol ended up expanding to power more than just cool light shows and now is starting to change the ways hundreds of thousands of devices communicate with each other on a daily basis.

A lot has happened since posting my first AMA two years ago. For example, I bought my cat a new, heated bed and had my first experience with investors.

I’ve been extremely lucky with how everything has turned out so far and can only hope for good things to come. My iPhone logs that I'm on Reddit 7+ hours per week... so I thought I'd use that time today in the hopes that I can help others who are just starting to code, wanting to code, or looking to start a business. Or, perhaps more importantly, I just want to re-share [this photo of my cat](http://imgur.com/a/TJFCl).

I recently joined reddit and I get a lot of questions about my situation IRL, so I thought maybe you guys would be interested too! I was born with a rare and terminal lung disease called Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and it eventually got bad enough that I needed to be listed for a double-lung transplant. After a year of waiting on the list, I received my transplant at the age of 14. 

About 6 months after the transplant, I started having severe stomach and back pain. At first my doctors shrugged it off as medicine-related pain, but when it got so bad that I physically could not get out of bed, they decided to hospitalize me. While hospitalized, I learned I had stage 4 of a specialized kind of non-hodkin's lymphoma that only happens after organ transplants called Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). I was 15 years old at the time of diagnosis. 

I had to go to live in a different state for 8 months to receive my treatment due to there being no specialists in my state or even any of the states surrounding mine. As you can imagine, this was very difficult for me.

When I received my first chemo treatment, all seemed to go well.  I lost my hair, however, that was something to be expected. But about a week after I got the treatment, I started having extreme stomach pain (again!). They thought it was nausea from the chemo at first, but after a few days of me suffering in a morphine-haze, they finally opened me up. Turns out I had 10+ large intestinal perforations. For those who don't know, that means I had over 10 holes in my intestines and my liquid fecal matter was free floating around my abdominal cavity. During the surgery to fix this, the lead surgeon called my mom and asked whether or not she wanted him to proceed with the operation because he did not think I would survive. She said yes and so he finished it up. I won't go into too much detail, but after the surgery I went into septic shock and also developed a fungal infection, all whilst possessing about zero immune system. I spent a total of 3 months in the hospital, half of which was in the ICU. It was pretty much a miracle I survived.

I had to have a temporary ostomy bag for 6 months to allow my intestines to heal. (The ostomy bag would break sometimes, especially during the nightime. Nothing quite like being 15 years old and waking up drenched in your own liquid shit.) Since I was getting my treatment at a hospital far away from home and in a very expensive city, my mother and I had to live in a tiny studio apartment. It was super hard and I actually don't remember much from that period of time since I was so traumatized I repressed most of the memories. I suppose that was a good thing.

Lastly, after I had my operation to reverse my ostomy, there was a medical error and they gave me too many fluids, resulting me in developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. I was on the vent for 5 days and they weren't sure if I'd make it. Despite this trauma to my (transplanted) lungs, I still have above average lung function today. I also had to do an entire year of physical therapy because one of the chemo meds totally fucked up my leg nerves and I was forced to relearn how to walk. 

It's been a crazy journey, and a challenging one, but it's been worth it. I am alive and healthy today and for that I am forever grateful. I just finished my first full year of school since the 4th grade and even finished the semester with a 4.0. I'm a year behind peers my age in school (I just finished sophomore year) because I had to take a year off for the cancer, but that sure doesn't stop me. I have big plans for the future and nothing will get in the way of them!

rzzm63,I am an attorney who passed the bar without attending law school. Ask me anything!,12099,0.92,1123,2022-01-10 01:10:36,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rzzm63/i_am_an_attorney_who_passed_the_bar_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/rzzm63/i_am_an_attorney_who_passed_the_bar_without/,self.IAmA,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"In the United States, there are four states that allow a person to qualify to take the bar exam without attending any law school:  California, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.   Instead, the student studies between three and four years in a law office.  Each state has their own rules regarding reading the law, but all require that the student study the black letter law in multiple subjects.  A fifth state, New York, allows students to enter into a law office study program after completing one year of law school.

The most famous modern day reader of the law is Kim Kardashian.  She is currently enrolled in the Law Office Study Program in California and recently passed the First Year Law Office Student Examination (""baby bar."")

I am fortunate to live in Virginia where I was able to enroll in and complete the law reader program.  I passed the bar exam on my first attempt and am now a practicing attorney.  I am including my acceptance letter into the law office program and my letter confirming that I passed the bar exam.

I have been asked many questions about the law reader program and becoming an attorney through this unconventional route, so I am offering an AMA today.

Copy of the letters:   [https://ibb.co/D7NMMjw](https://ibb.co/D7NMMjw)

&#x200B;

**FAQ**

1. Can I transfer my law license to another state?

No.  Each start has their own requirements for admission into their bar and the vast majority require a Juris Doctorate degree.  I think that there are a couple of jurisdictions (like DC and Vermont) that allow for reciprocity for an attorney without a JD, but I would have to double check.  Overall though, law readers are somewhat confined to their state.  A law reader from one state can't even transfer to another law reader state.  Each state's bar at the end of the day has the final call on who they admit into their bar.

&#x200B;

2.  Can I practice federal law in another state?

It is my understanding that tax courts and immigration courts have their own licensure requirements, so it may be possible for me to practice in those courts.  However, I have no experience in those areas and so I have not looked more into those possibilities.  Generally though, federal courts that are not specialized (like immigration and tax) require the attorney to be admitted into that state's bar.

&#x200B;

3.  What resources did I use to study the law and for the bar exam?

From the start, I used Barbri and Quimbee.  Those two resources helped me the most in learning the basics of the law.  I watched all of their videos.  I read all of Barbri's outlines.  Whenever an outline referenced a case, I used Quimbee to review the case brief. I also purchased other legal study resources (books and lectures) for each topic.  YouTube was a great source for lectures depending on the topic.  There is a lot you can learn on YouTube!

Later, I started to use Emanuel's Bootcamp for the MBE (which I highly recommend), Critical Pass Cards, and BarMax's MBE question bank.  The question bank in particular was very helpful starting my second year.  I purchased the Studicata Attack Outline my third year, which helped me in the last areas that I was studying as well as during bar prep.

A full year before the bar exam, I started answering/ reviewing 10 MBE questions five days a week.  By the time bar prep rolled around, I had completed the entire 1,400+ mixed question bank.  I consistently received passing scores on the MBE practice tests.

The bar prep course I went with was Barbri, though I didn't follow their schedule.  By that point, I knew what worked best for me and studying.  I made my own schedule using their resources and that ultimately worked out well for me.  What I found to be the most useful studying tactics were practicing essay questions by quickly outlining what I would answer (this exposed me to several essay questions), practicing MBEs, and outlining the black letter law from model essay questions.

&#x200B;

4.  How did I remember all of the information?

One thing I learned pretty quickly is that I am not as good at memorizing things as I used to be when I was in college. I used mnemonics on the absolute must need to know stuff, like the elements required for a prima facie case. Everything else, I would retain the information by tying it back to something that I already knew. Instead of trying to learn clumps of new information then, I expanded on what I already knew.

Still, there were subjects that I had very little exposure to. For those topics, I focused more on learning and understanding the concepts rather than straight up memorization. I would read the outlines that Barbri wrote and then look up the case brief every time a case was referenced with a law. The case briefs provided stories as to why the law became the law. People remember stories better than memorization and that helped me too.

For the bar exam itself, I didn't worry about having exact definitions memorized.  I instead focused on understanding all of the concepts so that if I needed to define something, I could in my own words.  It was not as condensed as the study guide's definition, but I got the point across that I knew what the term meant.

&#x200B;

5.  How did I remain motivated to study for three years?

I am very goal oriented.  Each week I set goals for myself and always aimed to meet them.  The study resources I used also provided lots of practice tests and exams.  I practiced those often.  When ever I would miss questions, it spurred me on to do better next time.  I kept working on tests in a subject until I had a firm grasp of the area and could pass bar-exam level questions.  I hate making mistakes, so missing questions motivated me to review that issue so I wouldn't miss it again.  Seeing improvement was also motivating.

&#x200B;

6.  Do I recommend the law reader program?

I would love to see more states have a law reader program option.  However, I don't think that it is for everyone.  There are cons to the program, like not having a JD at the end of the program.  Many law offices require a JD.

Also, the law reader program is a very lonely path.  Most of the time, the supervising attorney is working on his/her cases while the student studies in a separate office.  Virginia only requires 3 hours of direct one on one time with the student.  The rest of the time the student is studying on his/ her own.  If there are questions, maybe the supervising attorney will know the answer and maybe not.  In law school, there is a professor for each course that can answer questions.  There are other students you can bounce ideas off with.  But, law readers are mostly on their own.  There is no one to commiserate with, and when you don't know an answer, you have to do the legal research to find it.

Of course there are pros, like not having the debt.  This is very freeing because I don't have to take a high stress job or case load.  I am also able to accept lower paid court appointed cases that help out my community.

Overall, I recommend the program to those people who have worked in the legal community, know what it is like to work in a law office and have the experience of working in an office.  That experience is so incredibly helpful when studying for the bar.  It also gives the person a real picture of what it is to be a lawyer, so he or she knows if that is the right career path to take.

Each person will have to balance the pros and cons for him or herself.  Virginia's bar examiners wrote a memo on this issue here:  [https://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readermemo.html](https://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readermemo.html)

&#x200B;

7.  What area of law do I practice?

Primarily family law.  I was a family law paralegal for 14 years prior to taking the exam and it is what I know.  Sometimes I do other small civil matters, like a minor real property issue or a breach of contract.

As a note, in the answers you will see I reference both 11 years of paralegal experience and 14 years.  I had 11 years experience when I applied to the law reader program.  During the three years I was in the program, I continued to work in my spare time as a freelance paralegal.  By the time then I finished the program, I had three additional years of experience, for a total of 14 years.

&#x200B;

8.  Can I help you with your Virginia legal problem?

I don't accept any cases through Reddit.  However, there are some great resources out there to help people.  The Virginia Lawyer Referral Service website is [https://vlrs.community.lawyer/](https://vlrs.community.lawyer/).  For those with low income, resources include your local legal aid office and [https://virginia.freelegalanswers.org/](https://virginia.freelegalanswers.org/).

&#x200B;

9.  What is the pass rate for law readers?

According to the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), between the years 2014 -2020, the national pass rate for law readers was an average 33%.  (As a note, California's statistics for law readers are not included if there were less than 11 law readers taking the bar for that year.  New York law readers were included.)  Between 2014 - 2020, the average pass rate for law readers in Virginia was 22%.

In comparison, in that same time the overall national pass rate was about 59%.  The overall average pass rate in Virginia was about 69%.

On May 11, 2014 I started a very long walk from Estonia in Northern Europe. 4 years and 3 months later I completed walking total 20,000 kilometers or 12,427 miles in 22 countries and had arrived to Sumatra Island in Indonesia.

To cross some rivers, seas and an ocean I also used some ferries, ships and planes.But 20,000 kilometers or 12,427 miles is the distance that I covered **100% by only walking!**

**SOME FACTS AND MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES**

* I slept and lived shortly in over [220 local homes](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOsSWr9xan6e3NqM-1VgTrwoswvK7B6YkfI6K-Y0oO_iUJ3fmQR_42kqhQ46vyY_g?key=aEpBOVNlNnZ6VVplbXp0dEdtZEFQcHgxR0V4bXJR) together with [local families](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EyFP46LddE&list=PLkuLFY8TBG06ajAhqKQkXDaCgGlBFQByc). Home is the most private place – a holy place. To be inside a local home together with a local family is surely one of the most special, interesting and enriching experience that can happen to any traveler.
* The longest time that I stayed in one home was over 3 months. I became very close with [one family](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP_19eCk3gesnAi7eYxuhgBC7p5Jw_h_y7tw4b3Zn4I-5HgERhwf496R-Kb4nurNw?key=YXZKY3JtTUNvdU4yMWxYSS1lWVpPQ1lfSFdwRU1n) in the mountains of Nepal and helped them to build a new house after the big Nepali earthquake.
* I slept alone in a [tent](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP1J5dHauHTMKhATHdZrYICmBnaDNR5iMObVHsdvZYk_K6ShV30fcR9buCh-CbTNQ?key=YmpveHE5NUhzUFFjQW9YNGRSUGlmbG1TQ2JXN3pn) for over 650 nights.

* When I started this long walk the total amount of money that I had in my pocket and in my bank was 8 euros. I even collected, washed and ate some edible leaves from the roadside. Later I rented out and sold my house which made the journey a bit easier. I also started to earn some money by writing [travel articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=meigo+mark&safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk012V2jWgSvzFAQX24sKsp2PLvZM4w:1586793782678&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8gv694-XoAhWGwJQKHcECD-oQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1280&bih=610), selling my travel photos and with [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/meigomark)

They gave me a lot of free drinks and food, invited me to their homes, gave me many gifts and even money!
* In 1 day I normally walked 25 - 35 kilometers. My daily record was 64 kilometers or 39 miles. I was going very slowly and I did not want to break any records.
* The weight of my bag varied a lot from from total 8 kg to 23 kilograms.
* For many weeks I was walking and camping in the [snowy mountains](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPOZyZ4Et4CYSZ_A_kXHx1Fuxk-BJ5EfLE1oZ8TkPKQSGOEoqKvjqoRcAe9Ikr_jg?key=NWp0bzFMUFljbEJFY2xHUk0tMkpYaVV0Uk9RLUhn) of Turkey with even -17 degrees celsius or / 1.4 °Fahrenheit.
* And for many weeks I passed some desert areas in Iran and in India where the temperature rose every day to +40 to + 42 degrees celcius or 107.6 °Fahrenheit.
* For many months I walked in the monsoon rains of Asia. In [Cambodia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2A9zUv8YIk) I once walked quite a long distance on a very remote road with the water over my knees.
* Once I crossed alone a hilly jungle in Laos where on day 3 I finished all my food and I started to [eat fresh bamboo leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qedWaKZsVnU).
* 2 times I was [bitten by dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-YBmVOv2RI) (India and Thailand) and once needed to go to a hospital because of that.
* Over 1 week my walking was escorted by heavily armed [police forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukHtcSxd2YY) of Northeast India and in Myanmar.
* In different countries I was invited to visit over 45 [schools and universities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPAEHnLoPa8&list=PLkuLFY8TBG04SIXcJ20X4T4vpmO9wLVG9) to share my travel experiences and photos with ten of thousands of students.
* For 1 month I lived [a zen monastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IerYuX9_54) in the mountains of Vietnam.
* My dear mother came to meet me and to travel together with we in Greece, Turkey, Nepal and in Vietnam. In Vietnam we had [an epic trip together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaQzOxmyl5g) where we bought one bicycle, my mother was riding the bicycle with our bags and I was running (not walking) near her for over 220 kilometers in 2 weeks.
* Together with my older sister Kadi we went to conquer the highest mountain in Greece - [Mount Olympos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mojRBSBnd4M)
* I was [learning taekwondo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IECDLsyJ-Y) with a 5th Den Black Belt Master while living the master's home.
* Many people joined my walk in different countries. The biggest group I had in Vietnam where 13 people joined the long walk for 5 days. [Amazing group walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0rJUoFQMM8)!
* I found new homes to [3 dogs and 4 cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9qJI8EXt9U) that I found abandoned in very remote roadsides. The longest time one dog walked with me was exactly 10 days.
* And I gave over 140 international [media interviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_5a3_trHA&list=PLkuLFY8TBG07n5dLv4A4kmAExFrgDcj6_) My biggest interview was a long TV interview for [**'Talk Vietnam'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht_5a3_trHA)**.**
* After I had walked 13,000 kilometers I had arrived to [Vietnam](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNcHS1PHowUvwOSryrW8UyZJXFD4t7qwO1YRsEvDaDxNJjiWf3xCBREBdwdjrgjzg?key=WE9HcG9DYmhHdkJHc1lFeWpmYVl6OXIwbE1CeUV3) where I met a girl named Sâm. She was a marathon runner and wished to join my walk for few days. **In the next exactly 1 year Sâm came to meet me and to walk together with me exactly 10 times – 2 times by bus and 8 times by airplane in 5 different countries!** Together we walked over 750 kilometers. In October 2018 we got married and last year in March we became parents of [**a baby girl!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOmOPvt4_KI&list=PLkuLFY8TBG07ICc7JqrspcLkSZJ5rjh7C) We are dreaming and making plans to continue traveling around the world [**all 3 of us**.](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipONc1VYRk7a3ZObDIZUX1P3cOsDtJBYgBatVoTtW3gyYo6EMQX7ZrML0I5lhLkMhg?key=ajI5QWhPZmJORzZRZmFTbG9PVWZBTkd3VEo1WHln) Waiting for the global pandemic to end! I would continue walking and my wife and daughter would move on the same route with a small camping car.

My dream is to walk in different countries at least +20,000 kilometers more to complete walking the total distance of planet Earth’s Equator which is 40,075 kilometers or 24,901 miles.

I spend my days and weekends working in a restaurant that tends to attract celebrities, politicians and the outrageously wealthy.

There are plenty of misconceptions, prejudice and simple misinformation about restaurants, from Michelin stars, to celebrity treatment to pricing. 

I've met countless celebrities, been yelled at by a few. I've had food thrown at me, been cursed at, been walked out on. 

On the flip side, I've had the pleasure of meeting some of the nicest people, trying some of the most unique foods, rarest wines and otherwise made a living in a career that certainly isn't considered glamorous. 

Ask away!

Note: Proof was submitted to mods privately, as my restaurant has a lot of active Redditors and I'm not trying to represent my place of work here when I give truthful answers. 


Edit: I've made it my goal to answer every single question so just be patient as I get to yours.


Edit 2: Jesus christ this is exhausting, no wonder actual celebrities give one word answers.



Edit 3: Okay guys, I told myself whenever I got my queue empty after a refresh, I'd call it a night. I just hit that milestone, so I'm gonna wrap it up. Sorry for any questions I missed, I tried my best.


It was great, hope it was a good read.

I'm a pianist and composer who used to work as a financial analyst in NYC. 3 years ago I quit my job and became a full-time pianist. But of course, no one was going to hire a financial analyst to perform at their concerts - so I rented out venues to give out my own. My first rental was Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall (!) and performed my [debut concert](https://www.carnegiehall.org/Calendar/2018/12/27/Lionel-Yu--Piano-0800PM).

Tomorrow I'm performing at [The Kennedy Center in Washington DC](https://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/explore-by-genre/classical-music/2021-2022/musicalbasics/), at the Terrace Theater which is a 400 person theater. The concert begins at 2PM EST and it will be 90 minutes of my original music + remixes of some classical pieces.

Unlike my previous concerts, this time we are sold out, but I'm livestreaming the whole thing for free on Youtube.

I'm in the midst of a lot of preparation but happy to answer any questions.

In 2008, I did a cool thing: Along with three teammates, I won a silver medal in fencing at the Beijing Olympic Games. When I began writing a memoir about those years, I always had a sense that I should focus on my struggle to deal with the immense pressure of Olympics (I crashed and burned at my first Games in Athens before Beijing). However, as I dug beneath the events of my life during the creative process, I realized that I could not ignore a secret that, until recently, I have hidden from nearly everyone around me. 

Since I was a teen, I have struggled with sexual performance anxiety. It constantly affected my confidence as an athlete, and it is impossible to ignore that my relentless pursuit to become an Olympian was, in some part, motivated by my fears that I was not enough of a man. 

Now, I feel compelled to share my story, not for its own sake, but because I have long seen a trend in sport and culture that I think needs to change. Many men still run outdated mental software that leads them to equate masculinity with winning, materialism, and sexual prowess. And with so many young boys sketching out the map for who they will become as they observe the men around them, I think it’s high time we think about what they are learning. 

You can read more about my story in my recent article for [Men’s Health](https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a27255036/jason-rogers-olympics-fencing-performance-anxiety/#) or get updates on my forthcoming book at Web: [www.jasonrogers.co](https://jasonrogers.co/) / IG: [@jasonrogersusa](https://www.instagram.com/jasonrogersusa/) / TW: [@jasonrogersusa](https://twitter.com/jasonrogersusa) / FB: [@jasonrogers.co](https://www.facebook.com/jasonrogers.co)

Hi, I’m Jamie Greubel Poser, 2014 Olympic bronze medal bobsledder for Team USA. Driving a bobsled is like driving a Ferrari at 80 mph on ice, without a seatbelt, brakes or gas pedal. As a driver, making the right split second decisions can be the difference between winning a race or sliding down the track on our faces…but no pressure! The first time I rode in a bobsled it felt like I got put in a tin can and kicked off a cliff and thought I’d never go back: now I’m on the hunt for my second Olympic medal at the 2018 Games in PyeongChang! I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia as the oldest of 4 kids, and I ran track at Cornell University. I’m married to a German Olympic bobsledder, I sprechen zee deutsch and love to play acoustic guitar. AMA!

Happy Halloween!

I'm Jon Schnitzer, director/producer of ""HAUNTERS: The Art Of The Scare"" a film about how boo-scare mazes for Halloween have spawned a controversial sub-culture of ""full contact"" extreme terror experiences, the visionaries who dedicate their lives to scaring people, and why we seek out these kind of experiences - especially in scary and unpredictable times.  

No surprise this Halloween is projected to be the biggest ever and that these kind of experiences are starting to be offered year round.

I filmed inside McKamey Manor, the most controversial extreme haunt in the world, infamous for going on for 8 hours, having no safe word and even waterboarding people. I also got unprecedented access to the creative geniuses behind Blackout, Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights, Knotts Scary Farm, Delusion and more traditional haunts too. HAUNTERS also features horror visionaries John Murdy (HHN) Jen Soska & Sylvia Soska (American Mary / Hellevator), Jason Blum (producer of The Purge, Happy Death Day, Insidious, Sinister), Jessica Cameron (Truth or Dare / Mania) and more.  

I always loved Halloween and horror movies since I was a kid, so I wanted to highlight the haunters as the artists they are, to capture the haunt subculture at a time when more and more people are seeking extreme ""scare-apy"", and to spark a debate about how far is too far.

But, first and foremost, I wanted to make a movie that would entertain people, so I have been thrilled to get so many rave reviews since premiering at Fantastic Fest last month - ""9 out of 10"" - Film Threat, ""An absolute blast"" - iHorror, ""Genuinely petrifying"" - Bloody Disgusting, ""Shockingly entertaining"" - Dread Central, ""An intoxicating study of our relationship with fear."" - Joblo, and more!  

HAUNTERS was a successfully funded Kickstarter project, that I made for under $100,000.  

My passion for this project also inspired some of my favorite composers and musicians to come on-board to create a killer soundtrack - Dead Man's Bones (Ryan Gosling & Zach Shields, who's also from the band Night Things and co-writer of the films Krampus and the upcoming Godzilla) and Emptyset, and an original score by Jonathan Snipes (“Room 237” & “The Nightmare”), Alexander Burke (recorded with Fiona Apple, David Lynch and Mr. Little Jeans) and Neil Baldock (recorded with Kanye West, Radiohead and Wilco).

My name is Tim Pool. In the past I worked for VICE and Fusion. My work has been featured internationally and I have been called ""The most innovative journalist in the street"" by journalism professor Jay Rosen.

I was part of the group that was mass arrested in DC. I was informed no less than three times by the supervising officer that I was ""under arrest"" and ""not free to leave.""

After about 45 minutes the Lt. on scene pulled me and two other NBC reporters out of the crowd and told us to leave.

This is a last minute AMA but after seeing a few articles decry the attack on the press while omitting that three journalists were released without being charged. I felt obligated to talk about what happened during J20.

3pn7i1,"I'm Alan, and I created Imgur. AMA!",11971,0.82,3745,2015-10-21 21:00:43,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3pn7i1/im_alan_and_i_created_imgur_ama/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3pn7i1/im_alan_and_i_created_imgur_ama/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"[It’s been awhile](https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/y81ju/) since I’ve done an AMA, and figured I’m well overdue for another one. Imgur has grown and changed so much over the last couple years that it’s now a huge entertainment destination on it’s own, but it all started here on Reddit first.

Back in 2009 I was frustrated with the state of image hosting on the Internet and thought that I could do something about it, and [that’s how Imgur was born](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7zlyd/my_gift_to_reddit_i_created_an_image_hosting). It started as a simple hosting service, but I quickly learned that running a website wasn’t so simple of a thing. To find out what to work on next, I lived off the user suggestions I was getting. Every morning I’d wake up to a new full inbox of user suggestions to go through. Those suggestions eventually led to the ""popular image gallery,"" accounts, comments, replies, messaging, notifications, apps -- all the features that make Imgur what it is today were at one point user suggestions. I was also lucky enough to have the [reddit community support Imgur with donations](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9nsoa/mrgrim_creator_of_imgur_is_barely_breaking_even/) (thank you!).

It wasn’t long before I moved out to San Francisco to start growing Imgur as a business, and within the first month, it won [TechCrunch’s Best Boostrapped Startup award](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/imgur-wins-best-bootstrapped-startup-sees-1-billion-pageviews-per-month/) ([and got a second one two years later](http://techcrunch.com/video/imgur-named-best-bootstrapped-startup-crunchies-awards-2013/518118899/)). From then on I started hiring engineers, improving the product, and focusing on the user experience. After another couple of years and growing the team to 12 people, we decided to take investment from the awesome people at [Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/). Since then, the small family that was the Imgur team has grown to a big family of over 60 people. [We’re now in a much bigger office](http://i.imgur.com/xB3Kh2Y.jpg), and whole teams are focused on different aspects of Imgur and we're all trying to make it the best place on the Internet to discover awesome images. 

The vision for Imgur has expanded a lot since the beginning. What we’re striving to do now is lift the world’s spirits for a few moments everyday. This might mean experiencing things that makes you laugh, that makes you smarter, that makes you feel supported, or that makes you feel inspired. No matter what it is, you walk away feeling better and glad you were able to escape your day to day and reconnect with humanity. Everyday I see us fulfilling this mission with the [amazing](http://imgur.com/gallery/Q19lE) [stories](http://imgur.com/gallery/cZMCY) [that](http://imgur.com/gallery/tFLMP) [people](http://imgur.com/gallery/729Nj) [share](http://imgur.com/gallery/uibU7) [every](http://imgur.com/gallery/Uhr1JF5) [day](http://imgur.com/gallery/HTlme), and we even threw what we called [Camp Imgur](http://mic.com/articles/123956/imgur-s-alan-and-sarah-schaaf-look-to-the-future) to celebrate that.

Some things that we’re working on now that have been challenging:

* Scaling the infrastructure has always been a challenge. We’ve gotten really good at it over the years, but things are always evolving and changing, and unfortunately that also means we see more downtime than we’d like to. This is pretty much a function of hiring though. [We need more great engineers](http://imgur.com/jobs) to help us take our infrastructure to the next level. You can read more about our stack from [this blog post](http://imgur.com/blog/2013/06/04/tech-tuesday-our-technology-stack/) I wrote a few years ago. Most of it is still true, except that we have new services that aren’t listed.

* The world is moving mobile and apps are hard to build. A lot of consumer companies were caught by surprise by the shift to mobile, but it’s the real deal. It would now be insane to be a consumer company to not have an app or a mobile optimized site, and we now see more mobile traffic than desktop traffic. To account for this, we’ve had to build 3 new teams this year to focus on mobile: iOS, Android, and Mobile Web. [I’m excited to say that we’ve released our apps](http://imgur.com/apps) earlier this year and they’re getting better and better, and we’re still working to improve them everyday. We now see half of all engagement on Imgur coming from mobile. But man, getting there was a big challenge and now we’re going to have to redo our whole API for the apps to scale.

I’ve learned an incredible amount of stuff over years thanks to Imgur. From running a startup, to organizing teams, to scaling MySQL to go way beyond what it was meant to do.  I’ve spoken [at more conferences](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/imgur-is-the-anti-facebook/) than I can remember, and have even done a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jxiJzIiz4). Also, **today is my birthday!** So, please feel free to **ask me anything**, or give suggestions on how to make Imgur even better.

*edit: proof http://imgur.com/pT3StKM*

**edit again: Thanks so much for all the questions! I've been answering them for almost 4 hours and it's time to get going. If anyone has anything else then feel free to PM me and I'll get back to you later.**

### Moyamoya Disease

>Moyamoya disease is a rare blood vessel (vascular) disorder in which the carotid artery in the skull becomes blocked or narrowed, reducing blood flow to your brain. Tiny blood vessels then open up at the base of the brain in an attempt to supply the brain with blood.

>— [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moyamoya-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355586#:~:text=Moyamoya%20disease%20is%20a%20rare,supply%20the%20brain%20with%20blood.) —

[Me in hospital when I first heard about the Moyamoya.](https://i.imgur.com/z0It4Mx.jpg)

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/XZCVgEm.jpg) are some [scans](https://i.imgur.com/qmjoYhW.jpg) of my brain. You can see that one side has these ""puffs"" of smoke like things that are the tiny moyamoya vessels in your brain.

My neurosurgeon says I am not at critical risk right now but all Moyamoya patients are just basically ticking time bombs until they eventually have a stroke so he recommends surgery sooner rather than later. I'll be getting a STA-MCA bypass surgery.

I just got my COVID-19 vaccination thanks to this rare brain disease (Phase 1b of New York State) [so I got that going for me, which is nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBWcRqPesws). And I will hopefully schedule my brain bypass surgery sometime after receiving my second vaccination shot in April.

If you or someone you know has Moyamoya, please encourage them to join the [Moyamoya patients Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/145861575578487/)!

Fun fact, ""moyamoya"" (モヤモヤ) means ""hazy / murky / foggy / fuzzy"" in Japanese and I think it's so funny how I learned Japanese and then was diagnosed with a rare Japanese brain disease.

### Board game - [_Welcome to Sysifus Corp_](https://sysifuscorp.com)

I started making this game in my parents basement back in May 2018. There were three reasons why I wanted to make a board game:

1. My father owns a printing company so I thought I'd have a competitive advantage.
2. I wanted to make a game but I was super burnt out of coding at this point (knee-deep in start up stuff).
3. I saw [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/84euua/i_left_my_day_job_to_make_board_games_with_my/) and thought, why the hell can't I do that too?

For those of you out there who are interested in making a game, I'd highly encourage it, but with some caveats—namely, don't fucking underestimate it.

It took me three whole years of blood, sweat, and tears to get it to where it is and if I had known it would take so long at the beginning, I'm not sure I would've done it. But looking back, boy am I a different man from when I started (see what I did there?)

Oh and I am currently running a giveaway for my board game over on /r/boardgames. [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/lqlb9w/solve_a_puzzle_and_win_a_free_board_game_giveaway/) to check that out and enter to win a free copy of my game!

### My startup - [DomaHub Domains](https://medium.com/@domahub)

DomaHub was a company that helped domainers (people who buy / sell domains) make sales landing pages for their large portfolio of domain names.

I know what you're thinking. Wow that's the sexiest idea I've ever heard, are you single?

The answer is no I'm not.

How did we come up with the idea?

Well at the time I was dating a lovely girl and our 100 days anniversary ([which is a thing in Korean culture](https://gogohanguk.com/en/blog/korean-couple-culture/)) was coming up. I wanted to do something geeky that involved web development because that's what I was good at. That gave me the idea of trying to buy the website www.happy100days.com to make a cute website for her. But then I thought, ""_I don't actually need the domain name for the entire year—I only need it for a day. I wish I could pay like $1 to just rent it for 24 hours..._""

And thus the idea of ""renting domain names"" was born. Think about being able to rent www.happybirthday.com (currently on sale for $5 million USD) for a few bucks to send to a friend. Or www.imsorryimdumb.com for a few hours to apologize to your girlfriend? (true story).

Stupid idea? Maybe. Didn't stop me and my brother from throwing several years of our prime youth into it. [Here's a photo from when we made our first $5.](https://i.imgur.com/ZpUf8EV.jpg)

Our VPN team is in a continuous cat-and-mouse game, going up against governments with billions of dollars behind them that fund censorship technology. We hope it will have a happy ending, but it’s not guaranteed. These countries block us, we fight back and win, then they block us again.

We keep going because access to the internet is a fundamental human right and it's crucial to preserving freedom online. If organizations and privacy-first companies like Proton don’t fight for it, then maybe nobody else will.

3udi8j,We are investigating the tragedy of Canada’s untold missing and murdered indigenous women. Ask us anything,11880,0.81,2099,2015-11-26 23:59:26,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3udi8j/we_are_investigating_the_tragedy_of_canadas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3udi8j/we_are_investigating_the_tragedy_of_canadas/,self.IAmA,0,0,,text,False,False,False,"Hello, I'm Kathryn Blaze Baum, The Globe and Mail’s beat reporter dedicated to covering the issue of Canada’s missing and murdered indigenous women.  Over the past 15 months, I have traveled to Winnipeg, Edmonton, Regina, Ottawa and remote First Nation communities such as Manitoba’s Garden Hill and Pinaymootang in search of compelling stories and answers to some of the big questions: What renders indigenous women so vulnerable? Who is perpetrating these crimes? What are police, governments and indigenous leaders doing about it? I have sat with grieving families who are still searching for those answers, and more – many cases remain unsolved, including that of Tina Fontaine, the 15-year-old Sagkeeng First Nation teen whose 2014 death reignited calls for a national inquiry into the violence.

My colleague, Matthew McClearn, is a Globe data journalist who has been spearheading The Globe's months-long effort to compile and vet a database of homicide and missing-person cases involving indigenous women. We started digging into how serial killing fits into the broader tragedy of Canada’s missing and murdered indigenous women about six months ago. Matthew obtained and crunched data from an American researcher, allowing The Globe to determine just how over-represented indigenous women are among Canada’s female serial-homicide victims.

Our analysis revealed aboriginal women are roughly seven times more likely to die at the hands of a serial killer than non-aboriginal women. (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prime-targets-serial-killers-and-indigenous-women/article27435090/) The investigation also found that at least 18 indigenous women were slain by convicted serial killers since 1980. To illuminate the human element of all this, we recently launched The Taken, a multimedia project that traces the lives of five indigenous women slain by different serial killers.

I'm a neuroscientist and professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine, heading the Moutri Lab. We develop protocols to turn stem cells intro brain organoids. These “mini-brains” can be derived from people like you and me, so we can have our own brain avatar in the lab.

People have been requesting me to do this for quite some time now, so I decided to give it a try! My name is Marina Amaral, I'm 22 and I live in Brazil. One day I decided to combine my fascination with history and skill using Photoshop by restoring and putting color into photos that were originally black and white, allowing people to see history from a new and colorful perspective. Each photo is made to be realistic by recognizing the value behind each one of them, respecting and preserving their stories, paying attention to the finer details and maintaining their original essence. Every completed work has gone through long and in-depth research and is supported by the opinions of experts in each particular area if necessary, to faithfully reproduce the original colors and atmosphere. My work ranges from simple portraits to complex and detailed images, taken from various historical periods covering a wide range of topics.


I've been doing this professionally for two years. I work with several publishers, magazines, TV stations, production companies, museums and institutions from different parts of the world. WIRED magazine has made an incredible story on me and my work, which you can read [here](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/marina-amaral-colorized-photos/). 

I'm working on several exciting personal projects at the moment and I'll be glad to share some of my thoughts with you!

iujssh,We are facing a severe housing affordability crisis in cities around the world. I'm an affordable housing advocate running for the Richmond City Council. AMA about what local government can do to ensure that every last one of us has a roof over our head!,11825,0.88,1523,2020-09-17 19:18:18,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iujssh/we_are_facing_a_severe_housing_affordability/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/iujssh/we_are_facing_a_severe_housing_affordability/,self.IAmA,0,8,,text,False,False,False,"My name's Willie Hilliard, and like the title says I'm an affordable housing advocate seeking a seat on the Richmond, Virginia City Council.  Let's talk housing policy (or anything else!)

There's two main ways local governments are actively hampering the construction of affordable housing.  

The first way is zoning regulations, which tell you what you can and can't build on a parcel of land.  Now, they have their place - it's good to prevent industry from building a coal plant next to a residential neighborhood!  But zoning has been taken too far, and now actively stifles the construction of enough new housing to meet most cities' needs.  Richmond in particular has shocking rates of eviction and housing-insecurity.  [We need to significantly relax zoning restrictions](https://www.williefor3rd.com/platform/#zoning).

The second way is property taxes on improvements on land (i.e. buildings).  Any economist will tell you that if you want less of something, just tax it!  So when we tax housing, we're introducing a distortion into the market that results in less of it (even where it is legal to build).  One policy states and municipalities can adopt is to avoid this is called [split-rate taxation](https://www.williefor3rd.com/platform/#taxes), which lowers the tax on buildings and raises the tax on the unimproved value of land to make up for the loss of revenue.

So, AMA about those policy areas, housing affordability in general, what it's like to be a candidate for office during a pandemic, or what changes we should implement in the Richmond City government!  You can find my comprehensive platform [here](https://www.williefor3rd.com/platform).

bsbndl,IAmAn Air Traffic Controller. This time last year I made a post about the FAA hiring more controllers via an “off the street” bid. Next month they will be doing so again. This is a 6 figure job that does not require a college degree. AMA.,11815,0.95,2619,2019-05-24 08:11:15,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bsbndl/iaman_air_traffic_controller_this_time_last_year/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bsbndl/iaman_air_traffic_controller_this_time_last_year/,self.IAmA,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"**FINAL UPDATE**


This thread is set to be archived in 5 days. At that point I won’t be able to update you all here, and you won’t have a way to communicate with each other. 


Because of this, I have created a subreddit [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC_Hiring/)  where we can all keep in touch moving forward. It’s still a work in progress, but I hope those of you who are still going through the process from last year’s bid join as well as all the new folks from this year. This should make things much easier for everyone moving forward. I hope to see you all over on r/ATC_Hiring !


**UPDATE November 15**


TOLs for Pool 2 are now going out.


**UPDATE November 6**


Well that was fast. Keep an eye on your emails, as TOLs have begun to filter out.


**UPDATE October 30**


According to HR, TOLs should start going out within the next 2-4 weeks. 


**UPDATE October 29**


Everybody, check your **application status** on USA Jobs. AT-SA results appear to be coming in. If your status has changed to **referred**, it means you have passed the exam and *may* be receiving a TOL in the coming months. It will also tell you which band you scored in. 


**UPDATE September 11**


If you took the AT-SA last year and never called HR to find out which tier your score fell into, now is the time to do so. If you scored “Best Qualified”, you do not want to test again as they will only use your most recent score. HR has confirmed that if you already have a “Best Qualified” score, you do not need to take any action at this time.


**UPDATE September 10**


CHECK YOUR EMAIL! The first wave of AT-SA invites have been unleashed. Don’t be discouraged if you haven’t received yours yet; they will go out in waves. 


**UPDATE August 30**

I just wanted to check in with everybody who has been patiently (mostly) waiting for the next step. Unfortunately I don’t have any news for you, as I haven’t heard of any emails going out yet from this bid. This process is incredibly slow, and this time frame is not extraordinary. I will update the second I am notified that emails have begun to go out. As always, hurry up and wait. 


**UPDATE June 18**

The bid has closed. Expect HR to take around a month or so to process applications and get emails sent out for the next step. Monitor you emails aggressively for updates. If you meet the minimum requirements you *will* be invited to take the AT-SA. 


**For those of you who applied last year and did not get a TOL:** You need to call and/or email HR to find out which band your AT-SA score fell in (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified). If you scored anything other than Best Qualified, my personal advice is to take the AT-SA again. I have confirmed with HR that the ATO will offer TOLs to those in the WQ or Q bands only after exhausting the BQ band. Note that they will use your **most recent** AT-SA score, so if you are already in the Best Qualified band there is no point in taking the exam again as your score can only go down. 


**UPDATE June 14**


The bid is up! You can apply now by clicking [HERE](https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/536694900) . Once the bid closes on June 17, HR will take *probably* around a month or so to eliminate applications from those who don’t meet the requirements. After that, everyone else will receive an email detailing the next step, scheduling your AT-SA exam. Good luck, and as always feel free to keep in touch with each other in the comments and shoot me a PM. 


**UPDATE June 13**


The bid opens **TOMORROW**. If you have any more questions, ask away!


**UPDATE May 29**


The bid will be open from **June 14 thru June 17**. The agency may close it early on June 16 if they get enough applicants within the first 48 hours. You will be able to find the listing [HERE](https://www.usajobs.gov/Search/?k=2152&amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;amp;utm_term=control_1) once it goes live. It will be titled “Air Traffic Control Specialist Trainee”.


**UPDATE May 27**


Added to the Frequently Asked Questions below. 


**UPDATE May 25**


Good morning! I’ll be back at it again today, answering any questions y’all still have. Feel free to comment to each other below and send me PMs with any individual questions. A few common questions I’ve been receiving:


- *When does the bid open?* — The rumored date is June 14, but it’s not official yet. I will post the actual date here once it’s announced. 


- *Do I get paid while at the academy?* — Yes. The FAA per diem will cover your housing and food. You won’t be able to pocket the leftover per diem the way you used to. In addition you’ll make somewhere around $11/hr (someone at the academy now feel free to give me the exact number, it’s been 3 years since I’ve been there) to cover your bills back home. 


- *Does the FAA pay for my moving expenses?* — No. However you will get 64 hours of paid “change of station” leave to give you a couple weeks to get situated in your new city. 


- *Is there a way to see what facilities need people now? I’d like to stay near XXX.* — There is a priority placement list, but it is useless to you right now. By the time you get your facility options at the academy the list will be completely different. 


- *What can I do to make my resume stand out?* — The hiring process is almost entirely automated. One of the only times a human will look at your resume is just to verify your job history and/or education. The best way to make yourself stand out against the competition is to score as high as you can on the AT-SA. 


- *What do I need to do right now?* — Follow this thread. If you want to be proactive you can go ahead and [MAKE YOUR PROFILE](https://www.usajobs.gov) on USA Jobs and set up your resume using the resume builder provided. Other than that, just bookmark this thread and keep in touch. I will handle this the same way I did last year by providing constant updates at the top as well as responding to all PMs.


Have a great day and I’ll see y’all in the comments!


**UPDATE 5, May 24**


I’ve managed to clear out all my chats and PMs, and it seems most questions in the comments were answered by myself or others. I’m packing it in for the night, but I’ll be back tomorrow to continue talking to you all. Feel free to send me any messages if you need more information. I’ll always get back to you guys.


Like I’ve mentioned, I will continue to update this thread similar to how I did it last year. As I get new information, I will post it as updates at the top of this thread, so be sure to follow. Goodnight Reddit, I’ll see y’all in the morning. 


**UPDATE 4, May 24**


I’m still trying to get to everybody, even those of you who PM’d me last night when I first posted this. I’m working today and trying to answer what I can while on break, but I’ll be sure to get to everybody eventually. Buckle in, this will be a **long** process.


**UPDATE 3, May 24**


A member from FAA Personnel Security has joined the conversation with some good insight regarding your personal history. Below is a copy of their comment:


“As someone who works in FAA Personnel Security I want to mention a few things here to save me time and you as well if you intend on applying:


There is about a 50% washout rate in the ATCS academy. So half of the students make it to the next step.


All ATCS go through an extensive background investigation with a NBIB investigator. You need to be honest and upfront in your answers on security documents and with the investigator. Don't think you can lie about your experience or education and not have it found out.


Don't apply if you've smoked weed or used drugs in the last few years and ever plan on smoking weed or using again. It doesn't matter if marijuana is legal in your state, it's still illegal federally and this is a federal government job with regular random testing.


Don't apply if you've had a dishonorable or general discharge from the military ever or have any currently delinquent federal debt this include student loans, taxes, mortgage. Make sure all of your debts are current and you've got payment plans going with proof of the plans and payments in writing.


Don't apply if you have any pending criminal charges (other than traffic citation related) or a recent criminal record within the last 3 years


Don't apply if you've been fired or resigned under the threat of being fired more than once in the last three years


With all that said, it's an awesome job if you can get through the academy and probation/OJT. I didn't even know anything about it other than the stigma of it being so stressful (it's not) until it was too late for me to apply due to age. Otherwise I would've jumped on it. It's not that stressful and the pay and benefits are excellent. A large number of ATCS have friends and family also in the FAA, which tells me it's not a bad gig at all. Do keep in mind though, that it is a huge responsibility and if you make a mistake controlling traffic, hundreds of lives could be put on the line. It's a safety related position and not to be taken lightly.”


**UPDATE 2, May 24**


I am in the process of adding the reference material from last year’s AMA to this one, but I am on mobile so it will take a little time. In the meantime, make sure to check out the “START HERE” link below. It has every bit of reference material I included last year.


**UPDATE May 24**


I went to sleep having answered everyone that had commented/messaged me at the time, and woke up to a lot more response. I will be getting to everybody whose comment wasn’t already answered by another helpful person, as well as every PM I’ve received. I will also keep this thread updated the same way I did last year, including updated on dates and times as they are released.

————————————————————————


Things you should understand: 


- This is a **long** and seemingly arbitrary process. There are people who saw my post last year, applied, and never got beyond the application process. Others got to the next step to take the AT-SA (an entrance exam of sorts) and never got a response from the FAA after that. Others passed the AT-SA and received a tentative offer letter (TOL) but are still going through the different clearances as we speak a year later.


- You will 99.9% have to relocate. The FAA does not care where you want to live. You will have limited options upon passing the academy that will be presented to you solely based on national staffing needs. There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren’t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. 


- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. 


*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You’ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it’s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you’ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.


There are people at the academy *right now* who saw my AMA last year on Reddit, applied, and got hired. Solely for that reason I am doing this again. If anybody has any interest whatsoever in this, please don’t hesitate to comment and/or PM me. I will respond to **everyone** eventually."

Hello Redditors! We are Harvard PhD students studying artificial intelligence (AI) and cognition representing [Science in the News \(SITN\)](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/), a Harvard Graduate Student organization committed to scientific outreach. SITN posts articles on their [blog](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/category/flash/), hosts [seminars](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/daycon/), creates [podcasts](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/category/podcast/), and [meet and greets with scientists and the public](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/).

Things we are interested in:

**AI in general:**
In what ways does artificial intelligence relate to human cognition? What are the future applications of AI in our daily lives? How will AI change how we do science? What types of things can AI predict? Will AI ever outpace human intelligence? 

**Graduate school and science communication:**
As a science outreach organization, how can we effectively engage the public in science? What is graduate school like? What is graduate school culture like and how was the road to getting here?

Participants include:

[Rockwell Anyoha](https://twitter.com/AnyohaBio) is a graduate student in the department of molecular biology with a background in physics and genetics. He has published work on [genetic regulation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/10/05/science.aag2445) but is currently using machine learning to model animal behavior. 

[Dana Boebinger](https://scholar.harvard.edu/danaboebinger) is a PhD candidate in the [Harvard-MIT program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/shbt/). She uses fMRI to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie human perception of complex sounds, like speech and music. She is currently working with both J[osh McDermott](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/) and [Nancy Kanwisher](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/) in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.

[Adam Riesselman](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=riesselman2014) is a PhD candidate in [Debora Marks’ lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School. He is using machine learning to understand the effects of mutations by modeling genomes from plants, animals, and microbes from the wild.

[Kevin Sitek](https://scholar.harvard.edu/sitek) is a PhD candidate in the [Harvard Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology](http://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/shbt/) working with [Satra Ghosh](http://satra.cogitatum.org/) and [John Gabrieli](http://gablab.mit.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&catid=78&id=68). He’s interested in how the brain processes sounds, particularly the sound of our own voices while we're speaking. How do we use expectations about what our voice will sound like, as well as feedback of what our voice actually sounds like, to plan what to say next and how to say it?

1. This might be a tough question seeing how they're all very funny people, but who would you say makes you laugh the most while on the set of 'Parks and Recreation'? Or are you just the one who makes everyone laugh?

2. What was it like working with Brad Pitt on 'Moneyball'? Did you pick up any tips from him which you believe have helped you become a more complete actor?

3. I know that you're married to actress Anna Faris. How did you two meet, and at what point did you know you were going to marry her?

4. Who would you say acts the most like their character on 'Parks and Recreation' when you guys aren't shooting?What was it like working with Stephen Colbert and Amy Sedaris on the 'Strangers with Candy' film? Do you have any funny stories from shooting?

5. On 'Parks and Recreation' you do a lot of ""Pratt Falls,"" in which you throw your body around. Have you ever seriously injured yourself while doing one of these? Do you usually get the shot in one take, or do you sometimes have to do multiple takes per fall? Also, in the season 4 episode ""Born & Raised"" there is a scene where you jump over a desk trying to obtain Leslie's birth certificate, and as I recall, you knock over a computer. Was that all part of the plan and was that computer just a prop, or was that done accidentally? If that was in fact a real computer, did you do some damage to it?

The ship was named the USS George Clymer.  He was all over the Pacific including the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, Okinawa, Leyte, New Zealand, Guam, Japan.  Aboard ship he worked in personnel, boxed and was a cartoonist.  He then participated in Operation Crossroads in 1946 which was part of the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests.

ACTUAL PROOF (with date): http://imgur.com/WfwHN7p

EDIT:  The interest so far is awesome.  Thanks guys.  Keep in mind that at his age some of the dates or places may be mixed up.  I'm trying to catch what I can.  Also, for anyone interested, he has written a memoir about his wartime days which I plan on putting up as a website and possibly a physical copy soon with pictures and his cartoons.

EDIT2: Big edit.  During the Korean War, he was actually stateside at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.  I always thought he didn't go overseas to Korea but this morning he said he did.  Turns out he thought I was talking about WW2 still and mixed them up.  He was in the military during the Korean War but only overseas during WW2 .  Apologies!

EDIT3: Also, I realize I spelled Bikini Atoll wrong in the title.

EDIT4: The response to this has been incredible.  He enjoyed it and I'm tremendously grateful there's this much interest in his story.  Thank you all.  I love Reddit.  We're winding down for now.  I'll try to keep up with additional questions later.

EDIT5: I should have caught this earlier but the gas attacks were not from the Japanese.  It was from the United States who used the gas as a screen to hide the ships."

So long story short:

I was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma (not very frequent cancer-like disease) in my 19th, had surgery that removed huge tumor from soft tissues under my knee and subsequent 6 blocks of chemotherapy.

When I was 21 - tumor returned back in the same knee and I had to amputate my leg above the knee.

Now when I am 22 (almost 23) - tumor is back once more but this time in form of metastases (4 of them) spread around my body.

I am on chemo once again but doctors say that my disease cannot be cured and I have anywhere between a couple of months and a couple of years left to live.

I just started living my life the way I wanted (I was working as software developer for my relatives since 14 years old, wanted to secure early retirement and worked 70-80+ hours a week) and deciding what I like and don’t like, what experiences I want to have, taking my own decisions, etc.


My mood throughout my disease was (and still is) heavily optimistic even though I do regret many things and decisions in my life.

Sorry for bad English grammar, it’s not my native language.

10h5x7n,"I’m Brett Murphy, a ProPublica reporter who just published a series on 911 CALL ANALYSIS, a new junk science that police and prosecutors have used against people who call for help. They decide people are lying based on their word choice, tone and even grammar — ASK (or tell) ME ANYTHING",9082,0.94,572,2023-01-21 01:01:53,IAmA,22547664,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10h5x7n/im_brett_murphy_a_propublica_reporter_who_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10h5x7n/im_brett_murphy_a_propublica_reporter_who_just/,self.IAmA,0,19,,text,False,False,False,"PROOF: https://i.redd.it/s3cnsz6sz8da1.jpg

For more than a decade, a training program known as 911 call analysis and its methods have spread across the country and burrowed deep into the justice system. By analyzing speech patterns, tone, pauses, word choice, and even grammar, practitioners believe they can identify “guilty indicators” and reveal a killer.

The problem: a consensus among researchers has found that 911 call analysis is scientifically baseless. The experts I talked to said using it in real cases is very dangerous. Still, prosecutors continue to leverage the method against unwitting defendants across the country, we found, sometimes disguising it in court because they know it doesn’t have a reliable scientific foundation.

In reporting [this series](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts), I found that those responsible for ensuring honest police work and fair trials — from police training boards to the judiciary — have instead helped 911 call analysis metastasize. It became clear that almost no one had bothered to ask even basic questions about the program.

[Here’s the story](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-jessica-logan-evidence) I wrote about a young mother in Illinois who was sent to prison for allegedly killing her baby after a detective analyzed her 911 call and then testified about it during her trial. For instance, she gave information in an inappropriate order. Some answers were too short. She equivocated. She repeated herself several times with “attempts to convince” the dispatcher of her son’s breathing problems. She was more focused on herself than her son: I need my baby, she said, instead of I need help for my baby. [Here’s a graphic that shows how it all works](https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-jessica-logan-evidence/#audio-tool). 
The program’s chief architect, Tracy Harpster, is a former cop from Ohio with little homicide investigation experience. The FBI helped his program go mainstream. When I talked to him last summer, Harpster defended 911 call analysis and noted that he has also helped defense attorneys argue for suspects’ innocence. He makes as much as $3,500 — typically taxpayer funded — for each training session.

If you don't know about me, I was on an MTV show called Jackass over twenty years ago and, somehow, it was still a thing twenty years later. I identify as an all-around entertainer, I love animals (hence, my Reddit handle is ""StreetDogLover"") and have plans to open an animal sanctuary with my fiancee on a property we just bought in Tennessee. I recently finished touring the world with a truly insane multi-media comedy show called ""Steve-O's Bucket List"", and I'm thrilled to let you all know that the show is streaming now for a limited time at steveo.com. I think that covers it, now, let's fuckin' go!!! YEAH DUDE!!!

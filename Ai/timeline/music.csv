7ekwu9,The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.,147876,0.9,1742,2017-11-22 01:59:11,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/7ekwu9/the_fcc_is_about_to_kill_net_neutrality_were/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/7ekwu9/the_fcc_is_about_to_kill_net_neutrality_were/,self.Music,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"**tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We’re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them.
Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.**

**WHAT’S HAPPENING?**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just [announced](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171120/11253438653/fcc-plan-to-use-thanksgiving-to-hide-attack-net-neutrality-vastly-underestimates-looming-backlash.shtml) its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we’re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.

**WHAT’S NET NEUTRALITY?**
Net neutrality is the [basic principle](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-rebooting-the-network-neutrality-debate/361809/) that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.

**WHY VERIZON STORES?**
The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on [lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15959932/comcast-verizon-att-net-neutrality-day-of-action) and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we’re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.

**WHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS?**
Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we’re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai’s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. 

**HOW CAN I JOIN?**

If not, you can [sign up to host one](http://act.demandprogress.org/event/team-internet/create/), and we’ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can’t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by [calling your lawmakers](http://battleforthenet.com/) and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests."

**[But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd. ](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.

**Please, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.** The time to act is now.

When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:

PIGEON FORGE, Tenn. (WZTV) — Dollywood on Tuesday announced they'll start paying a hundred percent of tuition for employees who wish to further their education. This includes the cost of fees and textbooks.

The education benefit package is available to all team members on the first day of their employment. The company says it's a way for employees at all levels to pursue their personal and professional dreams.

Piloted by Dolly Parton's operating partner Herschend Enterprises, the program from GROW U. will mark a significant investment for workers. President of Dollywood Company Eugene Naughton says it's an opportunity for employees to grow.

""One of The Dollywood Foundation’s key tenets is to ‘learn more.’ This program is created with that very tenet in mind. We want our hosts to develop themselves through advanced learning to fulfill the foundation’s other tenets: care more, dream more, and be more.""
The program will officially launch Feb. 24 for all seasonal, part-time, and full-time employees at Dollywood Parks & Resorts. Hosts can enroll in the program on their first day of employment.

""When our hosts strive to grow themselves, it makes our business and our community a truly better place,"" Naughton said. ""We care about our hosts’ development and we want their future to grow because of love—not loans."""

As the world quite literally burns and floods, it’s important to remember that individualism won’t really solve the climate crisis, especially compared to, say, the wholesale dismantling of the brutal grip the fossil fuel industry has on modern society. Still, there are some individuals who could probably stand to do a bit more to mitigate their carbon footprint — among them, the super-wealthy who make frequent use of carbon-spewing private jets. (And let’s not even get started on yachts.)

While private jets are used by rich folks of all kinds, their use among celebrities has come under scrutiny recently, with reports of the likes of Drake and Kylie Jenner taking flights that lasted less than 20 minutes. In response, the sustainability marketing firm Yard put together a new report using data to rank the celebrities whose private jets have flown the most so far this year — and subsequently dumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 

Drake and Jenner both appear on the list, but they’re actually nowhere near the top, which is occupied by none other than Taylor Swift. According to Yard, Swift’s jet flew 170 times between Jan. 1 and July 19 (the window for the Yard study), totaling 22,923 minutes, or 15.9 days, in the air. That output has created estimated total flight emissions of 8,293.54 tonnes of carbon, which Yard says is 1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions. (At least one more flight can be added to that list, too: The flight-tracking Twitter account Celebrity Jets notes that Swift’s plane flew today, July 29.)

“Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” a spokesperson for Swift tells Rolling Stone. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.”

To create this report, Yard scraped data from Celebrity Jets, which in turn pulls its info from ADS-B Exchange (“the world’s largest public source of unfiltered flight data,” according to its website). Yard based its carbon emissions estimates on a U.K. Department for Transportation estimate that a plane traveling at about 850 km/hour gives off 134 kg of CO2 per hour; that 134 kg estimate was multiplied with both time-spent-in-air and a factor of 2.7 to account for “radiative forcing,” which includes other harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide (2.7 was taken from Mark Lynas’ book Carbon Counter). That number was then divided by 1000 to convert to tonnes. 

Coming in behind Swift’s plane on Yard’s list was an aircraft belonging to boxer Floyd Mayweather, which emitted an estimated 7076.8 tonnes of CO2 from 177 flights so far this year (one of those flights lasted just 10 minutes). Coming in at number three on the list was Jay-Z, though his placement does come with a caveat: The data pulled for Jay is tied to the Puma Jet, a Gulfstream GV that Jay — the creative director for Puma — reportedly convinced the sneaker giant to purchase as a perk for the athletes it endorses.

While Jay-Z is not the only person flying on the Puma Jet, a rep for Yard said, “We attributed the jet to Jay-Z on this occasion because he requested the Puma jet as part of his sign-up deal to become the creative director of Puma basketball. The Puma jet’s tail numbers are N444SC at Jay-Z’s request. N, the standard US private jet registration code, 444, referring to his album of the same name and SC for his birth name, Shawn Carter. Without Jay-Z, this jet would cease to exist.”

The rest of the celebrities in Yard’s top 10 do appear to own the jets that provided the flight data for the report. To that end, though, it’s impossible to say if the specific owners are the ones traveling on these planes for every specific flight. For instance, Swift actually has two planes that CelebJets tracks, and obviously, she can’t be using both at once.

So, beyond the Jay-Z/the Puma Jet, next on Yard’s list is former baseball star Alex Rodriguez’s plane, which racked up 106 flights and emitted 5,342.7 tonnes of CO2. And rounding out the top five is a jet belonging to country star Blake Shelton, which has so far taken 111 flights and emitted 4495 tonnes of CO2. The rest of the Top 10 includes jets belonging to director Steven Spielberg (61 flights, 4,465 tonnes), Kim Kardashian (57 flights, 4268.5 tonnes), Mark Wahlberg (101 flights, 3772.85 tones), Oprah Winfrey (68 flights, 3493.17 tonnes), and Travis Scott (54 flights, 3033.3 tonnes). 

Reps for the other nine celebrities in the top 10 of Yard’s list did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for comment. 

As for the two celebs who helped inspire Yard’s study: Kylie Jenner’s jet landed all the way down at number 19 (64 flights, 1682.7 tonnes), sandwiched between Jim Carey and Tom Cruise. And Drake’s plane popped up at number 16 (37 flights, 1844.09 tonnes), in between golfer Jack Nicklaus and Kenny Chesney. While Jenner has yet to address her 17-minute flight, Drake did respond to some criticism on Instagram by noting that nobody was even on the seven-minute, 12-minute, and 14-minute flights his Boeing 767 took during a six-week span. The explanation, in all honesty, doesn’t do him any favors.

“This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics… nobody takes that flight,” Drake said. (A rep for Drake did not immediately return Rolling Stone’s request for further comment.)"

71fe3y,TIL about a website called Boil the Frog - put in two artists of different genres and you'll get a Spotify playlist that gradually and seamlessly takes you from point A to point B.,62860,0.9,2707,2017-09-21 05:40:07,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/71fe3y/til_about_a_website_called_boil_the_frog_put_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/71fe3y/til_about_a_website_called_boil_the_frog_put_in/,self.Music,0,2,,text,False,,False,"(inb4 /r/TitleGore)

According to the website itself: Boil the Frog lets you create a playlist of songs that gradually takes you from one music style to another. It's like the proverbial frog in the pot of water. If you heat up the pot slowly enough, the frog will never notice that he's being made into a stew and jump out of the pot. With a Boil the frog playlist you can do the same, but with music. You can generate a playlist that will take the listener from one style of music to the other, without the listener ever noticing that they are being made into a stew.

I'm using it right now for the first time, so I can't really comment on the validity of their claim... but it's certainly a really damn cool idea. I'll give an update if my ""from Maya Jane Coles to Boris"" mix actually worked out.

So freaking angry at their stupid fees. My god. Was super pumped to see one of my favorite bands play a classic album from 20 years ago and was willing to travel about 2 hours to go see it (and probably still will) but damn you know how to take advantage of people when there is no other option in place other than physically getting to the venue.

I've been compiling this playlist for 7 years now! I've really tried to keep it impartial, but it'll of course skew slightly to my tastes and my demographic (British, 26, Male).

Hope some of you enjoy the playlist, always gets a room singing along.

Comment if you think I'm missing any songs, or any song doesn't deserve to be in there!

Edit:

Thanks guys, Couldn't be happier that people are enjoying the playlist! I've cleaned up some of the duplicates.

Some alternative playing methods from kind users porting the playlist to other services:

[Google Music](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5nu2vt/112_hour_playlist_of_the_most_recognizable_songs/dceg0qn/) and [Apple Music](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5nu2vt/112_hour_playlist_of_the_most_recognizable_songs/dceg98k/) and [Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5nu2vt/112_hour_playlist_of_the_most_recognizable_songs/dceniae/) and [Tidal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5nu2vt/112_hour_playlist_of_the_most_recognizable_songs/dcew4i6/)

Or is it more likely that he doesn’t give a fuck and is just concerned about the bad PR he’s getting. 

He’ll put out some half-assed apology while he’s stoned and this will be forgotten and happen again in less than a year.  This part of human psychology that makes people idolize these human turds baffles the fuck out of me. 

Rockstars are not gods, people. Judge them for their shitty actions and hold them accountable.

Also pay close attention to the cult-like vibes of people STILL defending this waste of air.

Also those calling me a boomer (I’m 30) and a white nationalist (I’m a minority/POC) for saying celebrity worship is bad just prove my point.

But even if 80% of it went to the band, it would make a huge difference for struggling artists putting out sick records. 

EDIT 2: WOW! The internet is a cruel, cruel place. Just to be clear - I understand that there are other ways to support artists... including ""buying the record, buying merch, and going to a show"". My point is that most (or at least many) of us no longer care to have LPs, CDs, or even MP3s lying around. I have never used or wanted band merch, and I simply don't get a chance to see bands I really like that often. So my point, once again, was to have a feature to DONATE to the artist (without getting anything physical, in return) through the platform that I listen to music on, which I realize doesn't pay smaller artists that well. 

Also to clarify, I understand that a lot of work goes into writing/recording/putting out a record; in a perfect world, this theoretical donation could be split between the artist and their label/legal/creative team however they saw fit. 


EDIT: Wow! I don't really understand how gold/upvotes work... I made this post a few days ago and didn't even realize that ANYONE had commented on it. Psyched to read all your thoughts! Thanks for the gold!!"

You used to be able to have a country song without it including mud, a truck, beer, the mention of cowboy boots or a cornfield. It's supposed to be much more than that and I think if we still had country from the good 'ol days, a lot less people would hate it. Country music is supposed to draw from down to earth living, love of the simple things, living a rural or blue collar life, overcoming struggle, working hard, love, etc just like a lot of other genres. Nowadays you're hard pressed to find a country song that's not part an extremely specific stereotype that's been pumped out for the past decade.

I understand some people are just never going to enjoy or relate to country music and that's fine but Jesus Christ let's stop acting like 85% of these modern artists are country. ""Hick"" would be a more appropriate name for this genre. It's the Party Down South types who think wearing a camouflage tank top and enjoying fishing is an identity. Singing about drinking, driving a truck in the mud, having a dog and a pretty blonde girlfriend to the twang of an acoustic guitar don't equate to a country lifestyle or music. These people took the soul out of country and killed the genre. 

Loretta Lynn. Dolly Parton. Johnny Cash. The Carter Family. Hank Williams. Merle Haggard. George Jones. Glen Campbell. Waylon Jennings. Patsy Cline. THEY are country, when it was still a respectable and relatable genre. The majority of what's released today under the 'country' label is a slap in the face to all of them. Modern ""country singers"" turned the genre into a joke.

Now, I'm not saying there are zero good country artists today. I have a few faves. But most of them just have seemed to complete miss the point of country music.

Edit: OK not trying to get myself to the victory speeches sub but goodness gracious was I not expecting this kind of response...I'm in a tizzy now cuz there's no way I can read all the comments"

Outside of 3 albums, my only experience with rock music is from video game soundtracks, movies and TV commercials. I tried to go into each one with an open mind and as blind as possible, doing research afterwards. This took 5 months to complete. Also, I chose to listen to them in a random order, as to not develop a unconscious bias for the older stuff.

1. Bob Dylan - The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963): B+ [2 listens] not really rock, but still very entertaining. He's really more of a poet than a musician and the lyrics carry the whole thing, with the music not being too impressive. I set a full day aside for his discography, so I would fully appreciate his later stuff if I understood what he first sounded like

2. The Beatles - Beatles for Sale (1964) B [1 Listen] this is the only Beatles album I didn't originally listen to at the same time as the others. This feels like a more focused A Hard Day's Night, but both are just as good. I've went into more detail on each Beatles Album in another post. But this is when they start to become great

3. Bob Dylan - Bringing It All Home (1965): A- [3 listens] I actually liked the acoustic side better lol. His first big dip into electric guitar on an album, it's pretty great. After hearing his other albums, this isn't that mind-blowing, but on the first listen, I was completely captivated by the storytelling from song to song. The only time I've ever looked up the lyrics to read side by side while listening

4. The Beatles - Help! (1965): B+ [3 listens] the effort and quality is the same, but it's much more varied than AHDN. They're doing it all here, wonderfully. It's variety is what gives it a slight edge over their ""touring era"" albums

5. Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited (1965): A++ [4 listens] The album where ""the 60s officially started"", this is really great. Going full electric did nothing to change the fact that he's such a great lyricist, that he can make an album with only a triangle and it'll still be great to hear him speak. Also, Like A Rolling Stone lived up the hype, the entire choruses to the harmonica is literally perfect

6. The Beatles - Rubber Soul (1965): A++ [5 listens] Ok, this is where I started to understand why they're considered the GOAT. Ginormous step up in musical ability, they were in the zone here. Apparently, this started the album era and I can see why. It's incredible from front to back

7. The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds (1966): A+ [4 listens] the 3rd album I listened to and it was WAAAY too early (after Metallica) and I was NOT accustomed to the sound yet. It was after I listened to the Beatles and understood the sound of that era, that I could properly understand it in the right context. It's probably the most consistent album I've heard, not a single bad song here. I'm glad I'm able to have respect for this album

8. Bob Dylan - Blonde on Blonde (1966): Masterpiece [5 listens] the lyricism of Highway 61 plus much better musicality from the backing band and Dylan, equals a true masterpiece. The musicianship in particular increased and truly makes the music JUST great as great the storytelling of every song.

9. The Beatles - Revolver (1966): Masterpiece [7 listens] At first I didn't like it because Rubber Soul was so good, but after repeated listens, it's fucking perfect. The mixtures of sounds and styles in just a single song is incredible, let alone great songwriting throughout (it's no longer all love songs, thank god)

10. The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967): MASTERPIECE [5 listens] probably the most anticipated album here, was underwhelmed at first, as this was supposed to be the GREATEST of all time. With more listens, it's so cohesive with it's style and it's time is what makes it stand out above the rest. You could hear that they were just trying to be as creative as possible

11. The Velvet Underground & Nico - Self-Titled (1967): A+ [3 listens] what a great album. Love the tone of the vocals here, matching with the unique music, particularly the guitar. Such a moody album, that teleports you to a small nightclub in the 60s, filled with smoke, where a couple of singers come to sing their emotions away on stage

12. The Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour (1967): B+ [3 listens] an actual B sides project, it's still pretty damn amazing. There's really no flow from track to track, but the quality of songs is enough to make it a great project

13. Cream - Disraeli Gears (1967): A+ [2 listens] I only knew that these guys apparently were a ""super group"" and that this was psychedelic rock. I had no idea that this was THE psychedelic rock album (I always assumed Sgt. Pepper's was). From front to back, consistent tone, as if I was transported to the late 60s with this record. I also assumed that because it's solely in one genre, that it'll get old after a second listen, but it got exponentially better

14. The Doors - The Doors (1967): A- [2 listen] Nice, laid back 60s rock. THIS is the sound I used to associate ""60s rock"" as. Pretty consistent, but no amazing highs to make it a favorite

15. The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced? (1967) B+ [1 listen] I understand why people say he's the best. The songs aren't really all that interesting, but what he's doing with the guitar certainly is. At times, it feels like he's just experimenting instead of making actual music, but whenever he does go off on a tangent, you're 100% into it

16. Bob Dylan - John Wesley Harding (1967): B+ [2 listen] I probably need to listen to it more to have a fully formed opinion on it, but as it stands, it's an okay project. More folk than rock which brings it down some but Bob Dylan can release a spoken word album and it'll still be great off his lyrics alone

17. The Band - Music from Big Pink (1968): A- [2 listens] I thought it was pretty presumptuous to name themselves THE Band, but nevertheless, they had a few highly rated albums. I had very low expectations and they exceeded them. Such a moody, cooled album. Also, Carry the Weight lived up to the standards

18. The Beatles - Self-Titled (""The White Album"") (1968) Masterpiece [5 listens] Underwhelmed at first, with how aimless it is, but came to see the greatness of it. The opposite of Revolver, every style gets it's own song where it gets explored to it's creative peak. It felt like it was a point it how random the songs where in this album. Like most Beatles stuff, I can't explain it but it just works. Spectacular

19. Van Morrison - Astral Weeks (1968) A- [2 listens] I didn't know whether to add this because it wasn't strictly defined as rock, but ""experimental."" I got the absolute wrong connotation when I saw that and disliked it at first. Ended up enjoying it a bit more on a 2nd listen. It's more experimental folk than rock, with a bunch of jazz and soul influence, yet it doesn't feel messy in it's execution. Given more listens, it could grow on me

20. The Beatles - Abbey Road (1969) Masterpiece [6 listens] Underwhelmed at first. I did some digging about it and how side A and B different, and that changed EVERYTHING. The ""Abbey Road Medley""... is the greatest 20 minutes of music I've ever heard in my life. I don't even want to say anything after that. But if the first half was as cohesive as the second, it would be in the ""greatest piece of art ever created"" status, for me. What a fucking send off

21. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Green River (1969): A+ [2 listens] probably the most blues heavy album I've heard, incredible style of rock on display. The singer-guitarist combo is also the best I've heard. So many songs popped out on the 2nd listen, like Lodi and I Wrote a Song for Everyone. Can't wait to hear their other albums!

22. The Rolling Stones - Let It Bleed (1969): B+ [3 listens] they have a very signature sound and style unique to them, but for some reason, I just don't love it that much. It was an easy listen, but aside from the first and final track, there's nothing here that stands out. Great sound tho

23. The Who - Tommy (1969): B [1 listens] A rock ""musical"", pretty unique to merge the two. While the songs are okay on their own, imo the story just not as interesting to warrant a double album of material. I was left wanting more of a complete, linear story, which is this severely lacked

24. Crimson King - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969): A- [1 listen] Didn't see this on any any big critic lists, but did see it a lot on Reddit. It's a great mixture of Jazz and classical music, with a rock base. It has a formless composition; favoring moments over fully fleshed out ideas. It does at times feel empty (idk if that is a common staple of ""progressive rock""), but overall the good parts make up for the tonal emptiness of a good chunk of the album

25. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin I (1969): A- [3 listens] I have heard of this band, but I had NO IDEA that they were this big or well respected (I thought they were on the same level as ACDC or Aerosmith, but with less hit songs lol). Someone said that they were ""the Beatles of the 70s"" and that quickly gave me some perspective. This feels like blues, but just infused with rock. Which is PERFECT with their individual members. The guitarists is incredible at riffing and freestyling, the drummer can easily switch back and forth between improving and supporting the bass guitar, while the lead has such a free flowing style, that he can easily adapt to whatever is behind him. It feels like you're in the studio with them, just hanging out, watching them freestyle on their instruments. I wish there was a bit more energy (that'll come later), but all in all, this is a great time. Also, the keys combo with the drums and bass on Your Time Is Gonna Come :)

26. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin II (1969): A [3 listens] what a follow-up! They went out to just make a better album, instead of doing something completely different (that'll come later). Their Debut must have been a giant success, because there's this big aura of confidence that every single member brings on here. Where LZ I feels like you're in a studio with them, LZ II feels like you're in a concert with them; the energy and tone here has completely been raised

27. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin III (1970): A [3 listens] This was probably the hardest LZ album to put my finger on. I was at first taken aback by the more acoustic sound and moving slightly away from their signature heavy rock sound. With multiple listens, the individual songs grew on me more than any from their first two. It's a great album with a bunch of experimentation of the structure of their songs, but not straying too far from what I expect LZ to sound like (that'll come later). It feels like you're hanging out around a campfire in the middle of the wilderness. I'm glad they decided to go in a different direction on the 3rd album

28. The Stooges - Fun House (1970): A- [2 listens] A ""vibe"" album is the best way to describe this. Just pure emotion and energy, as if music just comes out of them. It's so messy at times, that it becomes an art in itself

29. Black Sabbath - Self-Titled (1970): A- [3 listens] I originally thought this was going to be more ""thrash"" when I saw that this was the first ever Heavy Metal album (that's what I assumed all heavy metal sounded like), so after the first listen I was pretty underwhelmed. Thankfully, I revisited this after I listened to Paranoid and it was a much better time. Something about this era with it's 6-10 minute songs, where they truly squeeze out every single ounce of creativity they have for each song. Where instead of the ""best parts"", every song feels like a separate entity; having it's own journey it goes through

30. Black Sabbath - Paranoid (1970): A+ [2 listens] holy shit, what a improvement. They took everything great from their Debut and just refined it. Sort of the opposite of their Debut; every song here is more concise and is straightforward in their directions. I also had to mention the best song transition I've heard with Planet Caravan into Iron Man

31. The Beatles - Let It Be (1970): B+ [3 listens] solid ""epilogue"", loved the stripped production to make it feel more unique, but it pails in comparison to what came before it

32. George Harrison - All Things Must Pass (1970): A [2 listens] The only triple album I've listened to I believe, it's doesn't overstay it's welcome. My Sweet Lord is still one of the greatest songs ever made, Apple Scruffs is a personal favorite, as well as Wah Wah. It feels like he's just rocking out and we're just along for the ride. I love the ""wall of sound"" production throughout, but it does lose some of it's glammer when it's overused. Fantastic project and I'm glad George finally got the praise he deserved

33. John Lennon - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970): A [3 listens] Very personal album and not at all of what I expected a John Lennon solo project would be. With that said, it's an album that grows on you with every listen, as you get used to the tone. Although it's definitely a smaller scale project, with it's reduced production, his emotional vocal performance throughout really makes it's special

34. Led Zeppelin - Untitled ""Led Zeppelin IV"" (1971): A++ [4 listens] ingeniously building off of LZ III, this greatly adds on what it brought, while improving the production. The songs are no longer confined in a ordinary structure, free to go in any direction as they want and it perfectly highlights the incredible talent of the members, as their soloing to little moments of flair are on fully display. Stairway to Heaven (which I never heard before) and Levee Breaks are so great BECAUSE of this ability to completely change the song a quarter of the way through and then change it AGAIN! Only flaw is not every track is perfect (that'll come later). This one feels like I'm inside their minds, during a brainstorming process, watching them throw ideas at each other, bouncing off in complete harmony

35. The Who - Who's Next (1971): A+ [3 listens] Now I what their ""best"" looks like. Every song is fantastic, great songwriting throughout. The intro to Baba O'Riley is godly and that part in Won't Get Fooled Again was one of the most pleasant surprises so far. I'll definitely be listening to this more

36. Carole King - Tapestry (1971): A- [2 listens] Added it because of the lack of women I've seen, plus it's very highly rated. Pretty good but doesn't really feel like it's ""rock"". There's still a lot of enjoyable parts, she's a very expressive singer and is wonderful in making her songs feel personal

37. David Bowie - Hunky Dory (1971): A+ [2 listens] One of those people who I just accepted as ""GOATs"" without ever hearing their music, I was super excited to hear this. Really great, Bowie's performance is such a pleasure to listen to. I listened to this near the end and it's easier to see just how influential this sound would become in the upcoming decade

38. David Bowie - Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust (1972): A+ [2 listens] it's really a toss up between this and Hunky Dory on which I like better. Although, I like that this leans more into ""rock"" with it's heavier reliance on the guitar. Also, much better individual songs here

39. The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street (1972): B+ [1 listen] An improvement on Let It Bleed for me, it was much more enjoyable listen leaning more into a blues rock style that I believe is what they're best at, but I just don't think they're for me. That being said, it's hard to not like this album

40. Led Zeppelin - House of Holy (1973): A [3 listens] They sound like ""veterans"" here; the production, musicality, and composure with their individual instruments, are perfectly realized. They sound like one cohesive band, instead of 4 insanely talented guys just playing together (which isn't a negative, especially on LZ I and II). While I don't think they are at their best with the songwriting (that'll come later), it's easy to see that they're in their ""prime""

41. Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) A [4 listens] ""The Greatest Album of all time""? I've tried a few times to adore it but it didn't reach that level for me. What it is though, is the most cohesive album I've heard so far. It feels like 1 long song, which is a great compliment to describe the experience of listening to it (which I've come to see that it would become a trademark of Progressive Rock). Maybe if they added more ""individual songs"", I'd love it more. What all that being said, I can still see this being the GOAT in others eyes

42. Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973): A++ [2 listens] him and Bowie were in the category of ""Automatic Legends"" that were just constants of the universe. So I was glad to see an Elton John album come up and this was marvelous! I definitely need more listens, but this can easily be masterpiece after 3 more listens. The pianos, the vocal performance, the guitars, organs? It's all perfect

43. Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run (1975) A [2 listens] Did not expect this to be that good. I thought he was closer to country, but it's delightfully more pop centric. Very energetic choruses and phenomenal saxophone playing (an instrument I play). The whole is very great and surprisingly fun

44. Aerosmith - Toys in the Attic (1975): B- [2 listens] I assumed this band was way bigger than I thought they were, so I'm surprised I didn't see more of their work highly rated. This is a solid collection of songs, but nothing too ear grabbing about it. I'll probably never touch this album again

45. The Eagles - Hotel California (1975): B [1 listen] a wonderful title song, but it's an okay album. The rest couldn't match up the Hotel California and it was all downhill from there. Still good music, but nothing great imo

46. Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (1975): A [2 listens] I saw some critic say the phrase ""how do you follow up perfection? By making something that's arguably superior"" and that's a pretty good description of this album. I actually like this one slightly more. The ethereal spaces in between the more meaty lyrical sections are much better and pronounced this time around. The instruments are much more interesting in those transitional sections. And the individual songs are also better as well, love this project

47. Led Zeppelin - Physical Graffiti (1975) A++ [2 listens] The whole thing is great, I'm done trying to wrap my head around them. I'm leaning towards this and IV being my favorite LZ albums. My final thoughts on LZ is that they are the only band where the lead singer isn't the dominate identity; the guitarist brings every song up 5 notches, the bass drives EVERY song perfectly, and the drummer... made me appreciate the incredibly fine line between being super creative and staying in the pocket for the band. Every album they get better and better, is it possible for them to make a subpar album? (That'll come later lol :p)

48. Queen - A Night at the Opera (1975): A- [2 listens] I had to add at least one Queen album and this is a fun, wonderfully crafted listen. Definitely one of those you listen to the full album, instead of individual songs. Only flaw is the major standouts are on the first and the last tracks, so it does make everything in between feel lesser. With that said, still a lovely album.

49. Patti Smith - Horses (1975): A- [3 listens] Where are all the women at lol? I saw this top a bunch of all time lists, but rarely any Rock only lists, so I really had to go out and find this one. Pretty good listen, feels like Punk, but with much more variety in it's styles. Awesome album, with a great opener as well. Her vocal style is awesome

50. Bob Dylan - Blood on the Tracks (1975): A++ [3 listens] A heartbroken, love stricten Dylan, who's really going through some stuff here. Still the great storytelling that made him a legend, but much much more focused than any of his albums before it, given it's central theme. Fantastic, fantastic album!

51. Boston - Self-Titled (1976): A [3 listens] What an opening. Short album, but it's all hits. Don't have much to say about it because of it's length, but it's the sound I most identify as ""70s rock"". The light, airy space of the vocals, with heavenly guitar chords and energetic, head nodding riffs

52. The Ramones - Self-Titled (1976): B [2 listens] The ""original"" sound of what would become punk rock, this was actually a pretty good listen. The guitar riffs to the stressed, nonchalant vocals surprisingly works. This isn't the most creativity fueled project, but for what it is, it's pretty enthralling; a group of guys rocking out

53. Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977): B [2 listens] felt a bit repetitive at times with the vocal performance. With that being said, Johnny Rotten is the best part of this album, with the guitar and drums battling each other for 40 minutes being a close second. But definitely a good time

54. Fleetwood Mac - Rumours (1977): Masterpiece [4 listens] I've listened to this countless times (this amount is how much since I started the other albums). I absolutely love this album, from the harmonies, the musical rhythms, and the incredible quality from track to track. Not only is there not a single bad song here, but I'd go as far and say every song here is perfect

55. Steely Dan - Aja (1977): A [1 listen] I would call this more Jazz than Rock but that aside, this is a really fun listen. The Sax and the guitar steal nearly every song with their respective solos and every chorus is top notch.

56. Bruce Springsteen - Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978): A [2 listens] 2nd Springsteen album, this one is more varied in it's sound and no dragging moments at all. Actually, there's more impactful sections throughout, louder and closer to rock here, leaning on the drums and guitar much more.

57. Van Halen - Self-Titled (1978): B- [1 listen] This is a name I heard of before and after listening to this, it's definitely a sound I'm familiar with. This screams 80s guitar riffs to me and it was pretty fun to hear. The songwriting isn't really worth listening, but it's a great peek into what would be the mainstay sound for the upcoming decade.

58. The Clash - London Calling (1979): Masterpiece [5 listens] this is a great example of the difference between having a style and having an identity. My problem with other ""punk"" albums is that they all felt repetitive from song to song but with this, the styles constantly change and switch to keep it fresh from track to track; without losing their unique brand of sound. The guitar isn't unwieldy force, but is controlled and steady and can be that energetic force when it needs to (and you can actually hear the bass guitar!). The vocals lead every song and they are AMAZING, near the top of my favorite. It's punk rock at it's best

59. Joy Division - Unknown Pleasures (1979): A- [2 listens] Sounds like Gothic rock, but with punk influence. Love Day of the Lords and everything else is pretty solid. Great voice for this style, I'll listen to Closer in the future

60. AC/DC - Highway to Hell (1979): B+ [2 listens] With Back In Black being my very first intro into rock a long time ago, I was surprised that ACDC actually had a different lead singer at first. So this was definitely one I was interested in hearing the ""original"" (I, of course heard the title song before, but it didn't connect that it was different people). And while he and the band was great, to me it's always in Black In Black's shadow. Really fun album

61. AC/DC - Back In Black (1980): A++ [6 listens] The first rock album I listened to years before starting this list, it positively represented how ""good"" rock music was for me and that it's not so foreign as I always assumed it was. Listening to it in comparison with other albums, it's sound isn't as varied (the stereotypical flaw I attributed to ALL rock), but it's extremely consistent from track to track. My opinion of it didn't really change as much, but it will always the ""first"", so I have more love for it than others. Also, THIS guitarist is my favorite... by a mile

62. Motörhead - Ace of Spades (1980): B [ 2 listens] If you heard one song, you pretty much heard all their stuff. Luckily, their sound is pretty fun. I thought this was going to be Thrash Metal in sound, but it's much more of Hard Rock

63. Talking Heads - Remain In Light (1980): Masterpiece [3 listens] I saw it pretty high on RS top 500 list and the strikingly, creepy album cover quickly grabbed my attention. The cover art does a great job at setting the expectations, this is weird, odd, exciting, and captivating. The multiple layers of the background vocals, awesome guitar riffs, the lead in his weird, off-putting delivery in particular songs makes it insanely intriguing. But it's the percussion that truly makes this a masterpiece; it feels like there's 3 to 5 people playing different types of drums at a single time. This album is exhilarating and is an absolute banger. It feels like I'm having a fever dream; I don't even care if this is considered rock or not, it's great

64. Iron Maiden - Number of the Beast (1982) B [3 listens] I assumed it would thrash and ended up hating it. After more listens, its not half bad. The lead singer pretty much steals the show. Don't enter albums with preconceived sounds to expect, because you might get disappointed when it's different

65. Def Leppard - Pyromania (1983): B [2 listens] I had to do some background on the band and saw they were ""Glam Rock"" for context. So after having better framing, it's not half bad. Too Late for Love is a great song and they keep their style consistent for the most part. I'm still not the biggest fan of this genre, but I can at least respect it, which is kinda the whole point of this

66. R.E.M. - Murmur (1983): A [2 listens] never heard of this band before, but saw that they were influential in Alt Rock so I added this to the list. Very nice and laid back album. Not hard rock like most 80s albums, but enough energy throughout where I didn't get bored. I have a feeling this might grow on me more and more, really loved it on the 2nd listen

67. Bruce Springsteen - Born in the USA (1984): A+ [2 listens] On the 2nd listen, this one is my favorite from him. Same quality of music, but much better individual songs on this one, especially on Side B. I thought I was gonna hate his music going in and now, songs like Glory Days and Cover Me are in my standard rotation

68. Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms (1985): B [1 listen] pretty solid, nothing to incredible to say about it. More of a synth-pop and relaxed sound than a hard rock, but it's still good for what it is.

69. Metallica - Master of Puppets (1986): Masterpiece [4 listens] This is the ""Black Album"", but permanently stuck at 10. It was a bit relentless for me after the first listen, but since then, it's energy is matched by only a few albums. The guitarist is just having the time of his life, the base guitarist just ignores him and goes 120 mph for 40 minutes, while the drummer is seizuring, with random pausing and banging the hell out of the drumheads. Meanwhile, the lead masterfully finds a way to sing over this chaos. Even with all of this anarchy, there is clear structure underneath the madness, that makes the multiple listens more and more rewarding. I fully understand why it's called ""Thrash"" metal

70. Bon Jovi - Slippery When Wet (1986): B+ [1 listen] I'm pretty familiar with all the singles, but I was still surprised how good the whole thing was. I can listen to ""Glam Rock"", but it's not particularly my favorite. With that said, there's so many songs here that are heart pumping bangers, that I can't help but love

71. U2 - Joshua Tree (1987): B+ [2 listens] I'm definitely familiar with U2 and heard about them being very conceited and stuff like that. But as always, I go into every album with an open mind and this was pretty solid. Not really the Rock album I was expecting, but when I understood their style, it was hard to not be impressed with what they're doing here. Not my favorite type of music, but it's a solid project with no skippable sections anywhere

72. Guns & Roses - Appetite for Destruction (1987): A- [2 listens] one of the early albums I listened to and it blew me away! I loved the Hard Rock style and the peaks of high and low energy songs are connected by the incredible guitar playing; the singer is great, but the guitarist carries this album for me. Revisiting it, it doesn't have that same impact as it did the first time but it's still so much fun

73. The Cure - Disintegration (1989): A [2 listens] I thought it was gonna be more heavy metal based on the cover art and I HATED it on the first listen. After time away and better expectations of what it expect, this is so damn amazing; literally a 180° in my opinion. The moody, brooding tone is too great to not like and by far the best intro into an album

74. Pixies - Doolittle (1989): A- [2 listens] Never heard of them, but saw they were some of the influences of Nirvana. And I can definitely hear it, the vocal style here is very similar. I really can't put my finger on the musical genre, it's more of a mix of things instead of deviatives of genres, which is really interesting. Going to visit their other stuff later

75. Metallica - Self-Titled ""The Black Album"" (1991): A [3 listens] The first ""metal"" album I heard and its fucking incredible. Instantly knew that this was going to be my favorite genre of Rock. The vocals, guitar, the bass, the DRUMMING!!!! What a great intro to metal and I loved it. After hearing more albums, it doesn't quite hold up to others with it's weaker second half, but I played the first half of this more than any album in my car on Max volume. Still a personal favorite

76. Nirvana - Nevermind (1991): Masterpiece [6 listens] this has always been the standard from what I expect from the great rock albums. LOVED it the first time I heard it and still love it now. The first half of this album is perfection and the second half matches it with some great songs. It somehow tows the line of being super exciting and aggressive, yet very laid back and chill (I guess that's what ""grunge rock"" is). It's great, and I love it when more compared to the other albums I've now know. Perfection

77. U2 - Achtung Baby (1991): A- [3 listens] this is exactly the direction I wanted them to go in after Joshua's Tree. More upbeat and leaning more into Pop at times, it's much more captivating this time around. The songwriting is also much better here. I wouldn't have guessed that I would love a U2 album

78. Pearl Jam - Ten (1991): Masterpiece [5 listens] No clue who these guys were, but I saw someone suggest this as one of the greatest debut albums ever and next to Nevermind, it was one of the biggest pushers for grunge rock, so I listened to it early. Holy hell, what an intro to grunge! This moody yet passionate vocal performance mixed with this hard rock sound, goes together like peanut butter and jelly. One of the best first listens I had as well, I was just so surprised how great it was and how in the hell that I never heard of these guys before

79. Red Hot Chili Peppers - Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991): A+ [2 listens] I have heard of this band and I always had the connotation that they were corny/played out, for some reason (main reason it was near the last to be on the list). Man, is this album funky! Love the sound and they go all in on it as well. I have no idea how this was so successful during the grunge rock wave, but I'm glad it was

80. Rage Against The Machine - Self-Titled (1992): A++ [4 listens] Thank God I listened to this near the end, because this would've set the bar way to high for anything to follow. THIS should always be on the top of the list for any Rock album to suggest to rap fans. The perfect combination of hard/heavy metal and aggressive vocals and drumming. Excellent project

81. Alice in Chains - Dirt (1992): A [2 listens] I can't remember why, but I hated it on the first listen for some reason. But he second listen was so damn enjoyable, a complete opposite experience. The harmonies shouldn't work with this grunge metal sound, but it somehow goes together beautifully. It's a shame that I felt that I ""hated"" it for so long

82. Nirvana - In Utero (1993): A [2 listens] Held off on this, as to not get overly familiar with Nirvana as ""the"" sound of grunge rock. This feels more dirtier and more grittier with it's production. They do something different and I respect it so much for not taking the easy road

83. The Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream (1993): A+ [2 listens] I was going to skip this one, because I felt I already listened to enough Grunge Rock albums. Thank God I didn't, because this shows just the amount of versatility this genre lends itself to. They can go from slow to energetic, pulled back to emotional, rough and heavy to harmonic and beautiful. If this was shorter, I'd probably have listened to it more and raised the rating, but this is still really special

84. Nine Inch Nails - Downward Spiral (1994): A [3 listens] The best way to describe it is ""controlled chaos"". As if he's inside a tornado; picking up random, mangled debris flying around and creating music with it. This is unabashedly raw, gritty, and openly unrelenting. I really don't know WHY it works, but wow, it works amazingly. What a great experience

85. Green Day - Dookie (1994): A [2 listens] I've heard of American Idiot, so I was interested to see what made them known. This was really enjoyable and is similar to what my idea of what ""punk"" sounded like. Very difficult to point out any weak spots anywhere as the entire thing is extremely consistent. Just by looking at the cover and hearing the first few seconds of the first song, I can instantly visualize the mood of some random teen in the mid 90s in their bedroom

86. Soundgarden - Superunknown (1994): A [2 listens] Never heard of this band before and I vaguely know the name Chris Cornell, so I added to the list. Man, is this an awesome time. Whereas Nirvana tilts a bit more towards Hard Rock than punk imo, this feels like it firmly defines what grunge is to me. There's great songs spread throughout the whole album, so the runtime feels much easier (a criticism I have with longer albums; not spreading out the good songs). I feel like there's still room to grow with this album, but it's possible to become a masterpiece

87. Weezer - Self-Titled ""The Blue Album"" (1994): A- [1 listen] this is the punk rock of Dookie, but without the teenage angst and rage in the music (there's still a bit in the lyrics). This seemed like the album for the ""average"" 90s teen and feels like the actual soundtrack to an entire generation. Where Dookie was that stereotypical ""90s awesome teen"", this was something more realistic and more grounded

88. Oasis - Definitely Maybe (1994): A [2 listen] this was described as a ""breath of fresh air in the era of Grunge Rock dominance"", which is a cool perspective on why this is so well received. This ""Britpop"" album is much more fun and honestly, lighter than the stuff in the same year. Quite a few standout songs and it keeps that bright ray of sunlight throughout it's runtime

89. Radiohead - The Bends (1995): B+ [1 listen] I chose to set a full day aside for all of Radiohead's albums, because Ok Computer was the main reason I started this whole thing, so I went ahead and listened to all of their best albums together. In hindsight, a peek to what's to come, but compared to everything else, it's slightly above average. Still entertaining for what it is

90. Radiohead - Ok Computer (1997) A++ [3 listens] the most anticipated album on my list, due to the fact I saw a Reddit post about this being one of the most influential albums of the 2000s and I never heard of it not even once in my life. This is a really interesting album. Its more of a full experience than a collection of songs, but here the songs build off one another. Deeper into the album, every song here better and better. This isn't my favorite style/genre of music, but it's still so damn good

91. Radiohead - Kid A (2000): Masterpiece [4 listens] Ok, THIS is how you follow up perfection. They really lean into the weird side of Ok Computer without completely leaving the pocket of what they're great at. Experimental is the best word to describe this. The first song slaps you in the face of what type of journey you're going on and it doesn't let go of your hand until it finishes. It's atmospheric tone is unmatched at times, even when it sacrifices the more ""meaty"" individual songs like on Ok Computer or later on In Rainbows. But it's like entering another dimension for 45 minutes. Also, Idioteque gives me goosebumps even after the 10th listen

92. System of a Down - Toxicity (2001): Masterpiece [4 listens] I remember the name of this band growing up and I was surprised none of their projects came up when I searched for albums to add to my list. So I added their most liked album, and it was the best decision I made. This album is so fucking incredible. I love it for it's insane energy, but I've come up adore it for it's beauty in it's harmonic choruses and awesome baselines. My favorite performance by a singer on a project, more for his uniqueness in his inflection and the passion behind every phrase, he's giving 1000% on every song

93. The Strokes - Is This It (2001): A+ [2 listens] I thought it was going to be more heavy metal (the cover art with the woman). On the second listen, the choruses here are just way too good to hate. Super chill songs, but again, it's the passionated vocal performance that make it great. This is far from a ""boring album"" I once thought it was. The ""fractals"" cover is a better fit

94. The White Stripes - Elephant (2003): A+ [3 listens] Banger! SNA is still one of the greatest riffs ever, but it thankfully didn't overshadow the rest of the project. It's still mind-boggling that there's no bass guitar on this. The variety was unexpected, but really legitimatizes the entire album as a whole and not just the best songs

95. Arcade Fire - Funeral (2004): A- [2 listens] a really consistent listen from track to track. This is a sound I'm somewhat familiar with hearing growing up, but never associated it with ""rock"". This style won't wow you, but it's the style that make it such a beautiful album

96. Green Day - American Idiot (2004): A+ [1 listen] This time around, the sound is much more refined and there's a grander theme here; making this feel like a giant leap in their writing. Fantastic title track and I also had no idea Blvd of Broken Dreams was a Green Day song, so that was a great surprise. I'll listen to it more to better catch the story between the lyrics

97. Arctic Monkeys - Whatever You Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006): A++ [1 listen] Wow, what a sound! It's that indie rock style, but leaning into a punk style as well. Every song on here just places you into a mood and it's awesome! Also, love that it has a consistent theme of clubbing throughout the whole album. I'll listen to it more, but man this is great

98. Radiohead - In Rainbows (2007): A++ [3 listens] They take a different different direction here, putting more emphasis on individual songs having their own distinct identity. All 3 are neck and neck, with Kid A being the favorite

99. LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver (2007): A- [1 listen] This sounds more Electronic than Rock for most of it, but it's still a great listen. I recognize that one song from a 2k soundtrack  


100. Tame Impala - Currents (2015): A- [1 listen] The newest album I've listen to, but turns the clock back with a psychedelic rock sound. Really really nice feel, a mix of psyche and disco. Not as hard hitting as I like, but still consistent in what it wants to deliver"

sdizx3,Spotify sides with Joe Rogan over Neil Young and has started removing Neil Young's music from their platform,38144,0.8,9741,2022-01-27 04:28:34,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sdizx3/spotify_sides_with_joe_rogan_over_neil_young_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sdizx3/spotify_sides_with_joe_rogan_over_neil_young_and/,self.Music,0,9,,text,False,False,False,"Spotify has begun the process of removing Neil Young’s music from its catalog. The move was done at the singer-songwriter’s request, who cited his disgust over the proliferation of “fake information about vaccines” on the streaming platform. Young specifically took issue with Spotify’s promotion of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has become a breeding ground for false COVID information. “I want all my music off their platform. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” Young wrote in an open letter sent to his management and record label on Monday.

In a statement acknowledging Young’s request, a Spotify representative said, “We want all the world’s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic. We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon.” Young’s discography will be removed from Spotify later this evening.”

Meanwhile, in a new open letter Young elaborated on his stance. “Spotify has recently become a very damaging force via its public misinformation and lies about COVID,” he wrote. “I first learned of this problem by reading that 200 plus doctors had joined forces, taking on the dangerous life-threatening COVID falsehoods found in Spotify programming.”

“I realized I could not continue to support Spotify’s life threatening misinformation to the music loving public,” he continued. “Before I told my friends at Warner Bros about my desire to leave the Spotify platform, I was reminded by my own legal forces that contractually I did not have the control of my music to do that. I announced I was leaving anyway, because I knew I was. I was prepared to do all I could and more just to make sure that happened. I want to thank my truly great and supportive record company Warner Brothers – Reprise Records, for standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from Spotify. Thank You!”

Young noted that Spotify accounts for “60% of the streaming of my music to listeners around the world… Yet my friends at Warner Brothers Reprise stood with me, recognizing the threat the COVID misinformation on Spotify posed to the world – particularly for our young people who think everything they hear on Sptofiy is true. Unfortunately it is not.”

He closed his letter by encouraging other musicians to follow suit: “I sincerely hope that other artists and record companies will move off the Spotify platform and stop supporting Spotify’s deadly misinformation about COVID.”

You can read Young’s full note below.

SPOTIFY has recently become a very damaging force via its public misinformation and lies about COVID.

I first learned of this problem by reading that 200 plus doctors had joined forces, taking on the dangerous life-threatening COVID falsehoods found in SPOTIFY programming.

Most of the listeners hearing the unfactual, misleading and false COVID information on SPOTIFY are 24 years old, impressionable and easy to swing to the wrong side of the truth.

These young people believe SPOTIFY would never present grossly unfactual information. They unfortunately are wrong. I knew I had to try to point that out.

All my music is available on SPOTIFY, being sold to these young people, people who believe what they are hearing because it is on SPOTIFY, and people like me are supporting SPOTIFY by presenting my music there.

I realized I could not continue to support SPOTIFY’s life threatening misinformation to the music loving public.

Before I told my friends at Warner Bros about my desire to leave the SPOTIFY platform, I was reminded by my own legal forces that contractually I did not have the control of my music to do that. I announced I was leaving anyway, because I knew I was. I was prepared to do all I could and more just to make sure that happened.

I want to thank my truly great and supportive record company Warner Brothers – Reprise Records, for standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from Spotify. Thank You!

Spotify represents 60% of the streaming of my music to listeners around the world, almost every record I have ever released is available – my life’s music – a huge loss for my record company to absorb. Yet my friends at WARNER BROTHERS REPRISE stood with me, recognizing the threat the COVID misinformation on SPOTIFY posed to the world – particularly for our young people who think everything they hear on SPOTIFY is true. Unfortunately it is not.

Thank you WARNER BROTHERS for standing with me and taking the hit – losing 60% of my world wide streaming income in the name of Truth.

SPOTIFY has become the home of life threatening COVID misinformation. Lies being sold for money.

There is an upside for my listeners, people who may be listening to the 60 years of music I have made in my life so far. It is this: many other platforms, Amazon, Apple, and Qobuz, to name a few, present my music today in all its High-Resolution glory – the way it is intended to be heard, while unfortunately SPOTIFY continues to peddle the lowest quality in music reproduction. So much for art. But now that is in the past for me. Soon my music will live on in a better place.

I truly want to thank the many, many people who have reached out to me thanking me for taking this position – people who are health professionals on the front lines, people who have lost loved ones to COVID or who are worried for their own children and families. I have never felt so much love coming from so many.

I sincerely hope that other artists and record companies will move off the SPOTIFY platform and stop supporting SPOTIFY’s deadly misinformation about COVID.

In the name of Truth.

I am really excited about this because Frusciante wrote so much of the music that defines them. Thoughts?

>West’s rep cited a report in the Blast posted late Friday claiming that the artist’s team received a phone call Friday night informing him he had been “unfortunately” removed from the lineup of performers for the show due to his “concerning online behavior.” While West, who is up for five 2022 Grammy Awards, was not among the first list of performers announced on Tuesday, he may have been a planned performer. A rep for West sent Variety a link to that story, saying only “This is confirmed”; the rep did not respond to requests for further information, although the Blast report states, “Our sources say Kanye’s team isn’t surprised by the decision.”"

Hey Reddit,

Since my last AMA I’ve had a burning hole in my soul that only you can fill, so I’m back!.

I've had a a great time recently touring with Take That around the UK and you can see a video of some of the antics here in my version of Giant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf5jK46Cwe8

I’ve also gone a bit bonkers recently and made a spoof of Calvin Harris’s Fly Eye Glasses video.  'WTF' I hear you say?  Well in that case have a watch and read the description too for some much needed context.  https://youtu.be/LBHfRE3aE7c

So with all that said, strap yourself in and grab a cup of tea!   

P.S. I still love you /u/thebad_comedian

They get added to the cart as $94 + fees per ticket on the ticket selection page, which you would think would come out to be $400 or so at the end for 4 tickets.

Except when you get to the check out screen next, the tickets are now ""Advance Admission"" tickets and are $194.00 per ticket, + $15.50 service fee, + 4.75 order fee, + shipping because you cannot actually print them at home.  The total is now $842.75 for 4 tickets that when you go to buy them says $94 per ticket + fees.

So the ""Advance Admission"" must be adding a charge but there is no way to remove it and when you call, you get told the volume of calls is too high for you to talk to an operator so it disconnects.  Each ""Advance Admission"" GA ticket is $194!

So 4 tickets x $94 = $376

That means that the fees are $466.75!  This is outrageous.

\_\_\_\_

Edit: I was able to call in their automated phone system and it worked fine.  However, here is what it looks like online:

[Screenshot one: Me clearly buying them for $94 a piece](https://flic.kr/p/26mBnKu)

[Screenshot two: If you uncheck ""Advance Admission"" the tickets for the Floor suddenly disappear as an option to buy](https://flic.kr/p/2824r8N)

[Screenshot three: What my cart looks like on the next screen](https://flic.kr/p/297nxpt)

\_\_\_\_\_

Edit 2: Someone posted that they were able to buy them online without the fee, except at a different venue.  I tried to do that and you can clearly see what the problem is.

At that venue, it gives you the option to spend an extra $300 to get Early Admission [(Screen shot of that click here)](https://flic.kr/p/LYJN7L)

If you go to my venue, it says you get Early Admission but the price is quoted as $94 ([Screen shot here](https://flic.kr/p/KssfMR))

So either my venue is gouging, Ticketmaster is gouging just San Diego people, or Ticketmaster has a very convenient mistake that looks like it would be hard to do by accident.

_________________

Edit 3: so after some very enlightening PMs, it seems like Ticketmaster has fixed this issue. Also, it technically was a mistake this time.  An ex-employee says you have to ""code"" every show which is tedious and the first tier you program is the most expensive one.  It is really easy to omit the later tiers.

However, this system therefore always defaults to the most expensive overcharge and they've had this system for years with no material changes.  I hope the programmer for this event isn't punished for Ticketmaster leaving a shitty system in place that defaults to overcharging people because I am a karma whore.  Fix your shit Ticketmaster, there are programmers everywhere nowadays.  Don't make people feel like they have to overpay before the show sells out."

It’s a well-oiled machine. Young teens are groomed to perfection by these large entertainment companies with the sole purpose of making as much money as they can from their “investments”. 

Kids sign their lives away to these entertainment companies and are under strict control and supervision throughout their entire careers. They leave their families as young teens for training, with no guarantee to be a part of any group for years. And through all this, they are subjected to mental and physical abuse, which has pushed some k-pop artists to commit suicide. The pressures of the industry and the fans in South Korea are enormous, and Asia in general is on an entirely different level. 

These k-pop stars also have no say in any creative aspect of their music or performances. Every little detail and idea comes from the entertainment company. This aspect of the industry is troubling because it solidifies the idea of these kids as possessions, not people. How sad is it to pursue a music career knowing you will never be able to express yourself creatively, which is likely included in the contract they sign. 

Let’s end it on this gem. These entertainment companies, their CEOs and even some of the actual stars, have orchestrated a prostitution ring to lure foreign investors to invest in these shit companies. Women have been drugged, raped and sexually assaulted, and in some cases filmed without their knowledge or consent. 

The k-pop industry likes to project an image of glamour and perfection, but the reality is much more sinister."

> he came up from behind her in the crowd, grabbed her neck, and walked away silently. Later that same night, he hugged her and invited her to a party at the house where he was living in North Miami. At the house, he told her he liked her and suggested she could move in with him, she later agreed that night

> He slapped her and broke her iPhone 6S, because she had complimented a male friend on his new jewelry. (XXXTentacion later repaired the phone.) Later that day, XXXTentacion left the room and returned with two grilling implements—a “barbecue pitchfork” and a “barbecue cleaner,” she said—and told her to pick between them, because he was going to put one of them in her vagina. She chose the fork. He told her to undress. He was lightly dragging the tool against her inner thigh when she passed out. He did not penetrate her with it.

> ""pinpoint the days he threatened to kill you,” the reported victim responded, “Well, when we lived in Orlando, it was literally like every day.”

> ""And he was asking me why I was singing his friend’s part of the song, if I like him, why do I like him, like do I ever look at his Twitter,” Then, XXXTentacion head-butted her, punched her, stomped on her, and put her in the bathtub, where he continued hitting and kicking her. “He also wanted to cut out my tongue because I was singing the song,” she said. She tried to run away down the street. He tackled her, causing her head to hit the pavement. She suffered black eyes, a lump on the back of her head, scratch marks, and bruises, including a large bruise on her ankle where he stomped her.

> Also while living in Orlando, he hit her with white plastic clothes hangers. “He broke a good 30 hangers on my legs,” she said. Around this time, he tried cutting her hair, and he held her head under running water in the bathtub.

> In August (2016), XXXTentacion was arrested in a separate case. (As previously reported, he was charged with armed home invasion, robbery, and aggravated battery with a firearm, stemming from an alleged incident in November 2015.

> He told her he knew she had cheated on him. He put a knife to her neck, strangled her “a little bit,” and called her a “ho,” she said. That night, he woke her up and told her to go outside, where he picked up an empty glass beer bottle and demanded that she tell him the truth or, “I’m going to fuck you up.” She replied that she already was telling him the truth, that she had cheated and was sorry. He dropped the bottle, slapped her, and let her go back to bed.

> In two incidents there (Streetwater, Fl), XXXTentacion grabbed her by the neck, strangled her, and forced her down on the bed before another person who lived there came to the rescue.

> After finding out she was pregnant (which she claims was planned by both of them), XXXTentacion called the man she slept with while he was in jail. He then started elbowing, head-butting, and punching her. He strangled her until she almost passed out. He took her to the bathroom and demanded one last time that she tell him everything or he would kill her in the bathtub. She couldn’t even recognize her face in the mirror—it looked “distorted”—and her left eye was completely shut and “leaking blood.” She was losing vision. She vomited.

> After she requested to go to the hospital, XXXTentacion told her she couldn’t leave until her face had healed, because otherwise the police would be called. They left her in a bedroom, and XXXTentacion confiscated her phone. She didn’t get it back until he was arrested on October 8.

> For the next two days she didn’t leave that room except to use an adjacent bathroom. She couldn’t find a way to flee. There were bars on the windows. “If you’re smart, you would stay with me until you get a car and you have enough money to move into an apartment,” he told her. “Because if you leave now, you’re just setting yourself up for failure. You’re going to be homeless.”

> She let him know she was going into the kitchen to make him some food. She opened the refrigerator door wide enough so that he wouldn’t be able to see her if he she crouched down, and then she opened a side door and ran to the nearest main street she knew. She didn’t have any money. She asked someone if she could use their phone and called the only number she knew by heart. It was the number for the ex-boyfriend she had been living with the night she agreed to move in with XXXTentacion.

**TL;DR:** As someone from r/hiphopheads said, if this is true, this is Chris Brown x 100.

Dolly Parton has removed herself from consideration for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which she announced in a statement on Monday (March 14). “Even though I am extremely flattered and grateful to be nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, I don't feel that I have earned that right. I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out,” she wrote. This year was Parton’s first time being nominated. Read her full statement below.

This isn’t the first prize that Dolly has turned down: she twice declined a Presidential Medal of Freedom from the Trump administration, and has said she’s not sure whether she would accept one from the Biden administration, either. 

Eminem, Beck, A Tribe Called Quest, Carly Simon, and Duran Duran are still among those on the long list for the Rock Hall, with inductees announced in May. Fans can vote for their choice at the Rock Hall website through April 29.

Dolly Parton:

Dolly here! Even though I am extremely flattered and grateful to be nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, I don't feel that I have earned that right. I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out.

I do hope that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame will understand and be willing to consider me again - if I'm ever worthy. This has, however, inspired me to put out a hopefully great rock’n’roll album at some point in the future, which I have always wanted to do! My husband is a total rock’n’roll freak, and has always encouraged me to do one. I wish all of the nominees good luck and thank you again for the compliment. Good luck!"

I went to high school with the author, I think he was a year or two above me. That’s not important though.

What is important is that I read his post and I saw all the replies, especially this part of the thread where /u/GiraffeKiller tells him to start in the 1950s and work his way through the decades to which /u/_pH_ responds basically stating that if he starts then, he misses the entire jazz age. 

When I read this I realized just how set in my ways I was musically, mainly listening to the same 40-60 songs, pieces and soundtracks. 

Reading /u/deafstoryteller’s post and those two comments and I realized that a man who, until that point in time, had never understood or appreciated music was undergoing the experience of a lifetime. He was listening to all these songs for the very first time. 

Now, I may not be able to magically forget a song like *Bohemian Rhapsody* so I can listen to it for the first time again, but I figured I could do the next best thing and choose a starting point which I could begin my own musical journey. 

The key was figuring out where to begin. Starting anywhere in the 1900s would mean I miss a lot of musical foundations and at the same time, starting in the 1800s would mean skipping a lot of influential musical evolution. 

So I started at the beginning and set out to listen to everything I could find chronologically. I found Wikipedia’s table of years in music, went to 2nd Millennium BC and listened to the Hurrian Song from the 2nd Millennium BC. 

Now I’ve just hit 1900. 

Behind me has been a slew of fantastic music, from Handel’s Messiah and Alessandro Grandi’s plorabo die ac note to Mozart’s *Eine kleine Nachtmusik* and Luigi Boccherini’s *String Quintet in E Major.* From Charles Wesley’s *Soldiers of Christ, Arise* to Stephen Foster’s *My Old Kentucky Home* to Gilbert and Sullivan’s *HMS Pinafore.*

It’s taken me four years to get this far and in those four years, I’ve seen music go from something that could only be enjoyed by the high class upper crust of society to something even the common man can enjoy.

Further, what’s been a pretty straightforward evolutionary journey is about to explode into every possible direction stylistically and I’m looking forward to every minute of it. 

I might post what really stands out to me too.  

--EDIT--

Many have expressed their interest in a playlist with the pieces and songs that have really stood out to me. During the Baroque era and early classical era, I had started a playlist and as I kept going, I started posting what I really enjoyed to Facebook. 

Give me a few weeks and I'll consolidate them into a single playlist. "

There’s actually a lot more going on there than I knew back in the late ‘90s when it was all over the radio. Key to my newfound appreciation of it is reading the lyrics, most of which I couldn’t actually make out just from listening. Here they are, in their entirety:

> It ain't no joke, I'd like to buy the world a toke

> And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony

> And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars

> Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe



> This is a love attack, I know, went out but it's back

> It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact

> And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip

> If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique


> So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out

> Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive

> And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow

> But if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun


> Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out

> Of recession and oppression and together they toked

> And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire

> Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there?


> Some were spellbound, some were hellbound

> Some, they fell down and some got back up

> And fought back against the meltdown

> And their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites

I’m not saying it’s Dylan, but those lyrics are much more clever and intricate than they appear on first listen. Reading the lyrics also gives me the impression that the song is less cynical and sarcastic than I originally thought. I used to think it was just making fun of hippies, and how Baby Boomers abandoned their principles, and how the hippie movement was co-opted into a fashion statement. But giving it a closer look, the singer sounds genuinely sad and angry that we’ve forgotten the ideals behind the fashion.

I completely missed the meaning of the lines, “And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow / But if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin’ on the sun.” Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but to me this sounds less dismissive and more apocalyptic. I don’t know if he’s talking about global thermonuclear war or global warming, or both, but the impression I get from these lines is: the hippie ethos of peace and love and living in harmony with the earth is not just nice to think about; it’s necessary for our survival as a species. And if we as a society don’t reconnect with that, we will *literally destroy ourselves*. And these fuckers turned it into a meaningless fashion statement and sold it back to us as New Beetles and flared jeans, and now the only remnant of this incredibly vital counterculture is more widespread use of substances that *destroy people’s lives*. I mean, that’s fucking horrible! 

And seeing those lines that way casts new light on the part, “Allow, if you’re still alive...” I used to think that was just making fun of Baby Boomers for being old, and/or the endless cycle of old fads becoming cool again. But in light of “And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow,” it sounds more like a warning.

Funnily enough, it’s now been almost 25 years since this song was released. And the ice caps are melting at a terrifyingly fast rate and we are, thanks to Trump, once again perilously close to nuclear war. And we’re all kind of avoiding thinking about it by drowning ourselves in exactly the sort of distractions this song is about (drugs, consumerism, etc.). The hippies’ offer was definitively shunned, and now we’re closer than ever to our own destruction.

This is a surprisingly good song, man. It’s catchy, well-crafted, and well-written, with something to say and actual relevance to our time. Laugh at me all you want, but I’ve got genuine respect for Smash Mouth right now.

Also, the first person to comment “someBODY once told me” is getting downvoted so hard their grandchildren will lose karma.

Won't use any names of the hotel or person to keep privacy.  

So bruno Mars is performing at the Tacoma dome in Tacoma wa tonight 7/24. I work at a hotel that his pr team is currently having people stay at for this event. They end up having tons of packages delivered here today for whatever reason.  Some of the packages don't seem to get here and we get blamed for it,  the guy starts going off on me saying how we are complete idiots and he's going to make sure the hotel gets shut down for our incompetence and we are going to regret lying to him if we don't turn over the package since his online delivery had a status of delivered so he knew it was here.   

After about 3 hours of this back and forth and phone calls from multiple people related to the bruno Mars pr team they finally find out THEY SENT IT TO THE WRONG HOTEL!! We don't even get an apology or an I'm sorry for this.  Really aggravating.  I know this doesn't reflect on bruno Mars himself but he really should reconsider the people he has working for him

EDIT: didnt expect this to make it r/all.  Responding to most comments but now there are to many to keep up.

Just a few notes

1. I dont blame bruno mars or have anything against him

2. Lot of people are making guesses to what was in the package and claiming drugs. I honestly dont know.

3. Some people are wondering why i dont call them out on YouTube or social media and that is because i dont want to give out my own person information or work and get all the attention whether negative or not it may cause.

4. This post mostly came from me venting anon cause of a customer being rude which anyone who has worked customer service will know some of these customers i speak of"

**I lost my sweet Karen today. I was able to be with her through her last breath. She had been on home hospice for only a week. My heart is broken, but she is at peace, and not in pain. I don't need or request or expect any comments. I only needed to close this door and look forward. I've already sent Scott at Crush Music a note of appreciation for what he and Billie Joe Armstrong did for Karen. I guess no photos are allowed on the music page, but if anyone wants to see how beautiful she was, I'm going to post a photo of her with my old bike on the Harley page. THANK YOU to all who helped and tried to make me feel better.**

Dave

&#x200B;

PLEASE help! I'm desperate to help make my girlfriend smile!  Three days ago, she was diagnosed with stomach cancer that has spread to her spine and elsewhere. Karen probably has little time. She is the biggest GREEN DAY fan on earth, and would trade me for Billie Joe Armstrong in a heartbeat!

My heart is breaking because I can do so little for her. I can only visit her for 4 hours a day, so the rest of the time I'm lost. Is there anyone here that can show me a path to contacting the manager for Billie Joe Armstrong/Green Day? If Karen could just get a card or a kind word from Billie Joe, I know her heart would melt.

I'm trying one of those ""contact a celebrity"" websites, but frankly I have little confidence in such a commercial venture. I have much more in all of you.

Desperate for help. Thank you!

I'm going to repost our happy ending just to make sure you wonderful caring redditors see it again. I'm still getting many more replies. By the way, so is the representative of Crush Music. He said friends of friends of friends are still sending him the original link! Thanks again all!

(from last night)

OMG all of you! **IT WORKED!!!**! I just got home from visiting Karen. Earlier this afternoon I took a suggestion from one of you to contact Crush Music which has a Green Day connection. An email to their general info mailbox was soon answered by Scott Nagelberg. I opened the email in the hospital room to find that it INCLUDED A SWEET, HEARTFELT VIDEO MESSAGE TO KAREN FROM **BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG!!!**

We both ugly cried right there (this time for a GOOD reason). She just kept repeating until I had to leave ""That's the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me!""

I haven't had time to acknowledge everyone's comments, but I will. You have proven once again that the power of regular, caring people is undefeatable! Thank you all, and especially to **BILLIE JOE, SCOTT NAGELBERG, AND CRUSH MUSIC!** Y'all are awesome!

BTW, for the very few haters and doubters, I did Identify both Karen and myself to Crush Music, and included contact information.

......................................Update February 11th ......................................................

You've all been so kind, and many have asked for updates. Today Karen had her second round of radiation, and her first infusion of chemo. We are hoping she can come home this weekend. Thank you all again.

..................................Update February 16th...............................................................

Karen gets to come home after radiation today! still more of that and chemo for the foreseeable future, but it's a great step. Thank you all for your concerns.

...................................Update 2-27-21..........................................................

Since I'm still getting comments (thank you) I should update. Karen is home and completed radiation last Tuesday. She was supposed to have her chemo, but the medication did not arrive, so it's delayed until Monday. We are most concerned that she is unable to eat or drink virtually anything without nausea, and her weight is down to 98lbs. Her pain is manageable,  and she walks across the room with her walker. We do appreciate your continued concern.

3-31-21

I haven't updated in awhile, and I'm not sure if anyone is interested. Karen is still with me. She was back in the hospital last week due mainly to dehydration and lack of nutrition. (She still can't eat or drink without throwing up. I honestly don't know what's keeping her going.) She decided it was due to the chemo, so she refused to go for her infusion that was due last Monday.

She came home on Saturday, but refused home health visits. I heard her throwing up last night at 3 but she's sleeping now. Her sisters are supposed to come the last week of April, and her 2 kids and 2 grandchildren the week after that. Some part of me is afraid that she is just holding on for that. Another trip to the ER this week won't surprise me. They talked last week about doing another endoscopy, but she wanted OUT! (I know better than fight with her!) Thanks for listening."

If you can't find it maybe you could look for my username in spotify: **who-knows-who-cares.** In case it doesn't work here there are two links to my profile:

EDIT: I see that someone deleted all the first songs that you mentioned. Thank god I got them in other list and I could add them again, but please guys, behave!

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Thanks to this thread a reddit user ( [u/AceRockefeller](https://www.reddit.com/user/AceRockefeller) ) has created a subreddit dedicated to collaborating on playlists. Here it is:

[**r/CrowdSourcePlaylist**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrowdSourcePlaylist/)

&#x200B;

I see the playlist is getting a little messy. I'll try to make a **nice** **selection** in case you're interested! I'll keep you informed when it's ready! Below the link:

[https://open.spotify.com/user/oeykty9y3euojgq26mztarpib/playlist/6S69FjAFIQKDacjRibT4km?si=7-QigTDyT7u5c6B5RRuUYA](https://open.spotify.com/user/oeykty9y3euojgq26mztarpib/playlist/6S69FjAFIQKDacjRibT4km?si=7-QigTDyT7u5c6B5RRuUYA)

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Someone is deleting everything, so I had no other option than made it not collaborative (sorry, guys). I will try at least to make a selection trying to choose those that have been the most upvoted ones.

&#x200B;

EDIT: It's awesome the way you've all taken part in the initiative! This is one of the best examples why I love reddit.

sjsl3q,Spotify CEO addresses Joe Rogan controversy: “We don’t change our policies based on one creator”,25557,0.86,7837,2022-02-04 01:25:42,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sjsl3q/spotify_ceo_addresses_joe_rogan_controversy_we/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sjsl3q/spotify_ceo_addresses_joe_rogan_controversy_we/,self.Music,0,4,,text,False,False,False,"Article: https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-ceo-address-joe-rogan-controversy-we-dont-change-our-policies-based-on-one-creator/

Spotify CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek has addressed the company’s handling of the ongoing controversy surrounding Joe Rogan and his Spotify-exclusive podcast, The New York Times reports. “In general, what I would say is, it’s too early to know what the impact may be,” Ek reportedly said during an earnings call on Wednesday, February 2. “And usually when we’ve had controversies in the past, those are measured in months and not days. But I feel good about where we are in relation to that and obviously top line trends looks very healthy still.”

According to The Times, Ek also stated during the call:

I think the important part here is that we don’t change our policies based on one creator nor do we change it based on any media cycle, or calls from anyone else. Our policies have been carefully written with the input from numbers of internal and external experts in this space. And I do believe they’re right for our platform. And while Joe has a massive audience—he is actually the number one podcast in more than 90 markets—he also has to abide by those policies.

Along with his remarks during the earnings call, The Verge reports that Ek addressed the controversy during a town hall event with employees. “Regarding our platform rules, the fact that we hadn’t moved fast enough to make our policies available externally has made the situation especially difficult,” he reportedly said. “And these policies have been in place for years, but it was a mistake that they weren’t public. And that’s on me, and something that I will learn from.”

In December 2021, 270 medical professionals published an open letter criticizing The Joe Rogan Experience and claiming that the host has spread “false and societally harmful assertions” about the coronavirus. Since then, Neil Young has removed his music from Spotify, stating, “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” Many other musicians—including Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, David Crosby, and more—have also sought to have their work taken off Spotify in support of Young and his protest. Spotify has responded to the departures by adding content advisories to podcasts that discuss COVID-19."

I wasn't able to include every winner in the main post. To see the full list check out this link-> [2022 Reddit Grammy Awards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YI4CRjIHQA_ebJyRZM8zILVmesbpSo8D8JsZuw6IzNI/edit#heading=h.dmjpl3xwwzzy)

edit2:

This is my 3rd year sharing a [Reddit Grammy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/le2uak/i_spent_the_past_year_listening_to_over_15000/). Last year a few people mentioned to me that they would be interested in becoming involved in the process of listening to and rating music. I think creating a scene within Reddit where music lovers are paying attention to the underground artists that post music here would be amazing. I'd be interested to see how it effects the music scene. Maybe more people would discover new music that they love. Plus, having more people vote would broaden the overall appeal of the winners.

**If you'd like to be a judge of next year's Reddit Grammys,** I invite you to join the [Official Reddit Grammy's Discord](https://discord.gg/v42vz2uQ4n), where we will be listening to and rating music that gets posted to various music subreddits!

Now let alone that, I decided to actually look in the playlists that have him on the cover, and less than 50% of them actually have Drake in the playlist.  

Spotify is being such an unprofessional company to the point of disrespecting the artists that are in those playlists. And when they realize that they can get paid by any famous artist for this shit to happen, it will become a recurring thing. 

I just think it should stop now before it gets out of hand. 

Edit: Before this post explodes, I want to evaluate that I think some of you are missing the point. 

I love Spotify and it’s service. I’m not ripping on how bad Spotify is,  but rather I am trying to make notice of the fact that this could be a very bad trend if it continues, allowing already hugely famous artists to take over the playlists that we love and the community we love on spotify.

I've had headphones in my ears since I was 5. Music keeps me sane because people can't. Artists become my friends I never had. Music is how I've grown up. I've become a musician myself because it's the only way I can express my emotions. I can't talk to anyone about losing someone like Chester. They treat it like another stupid celebrity death. Living Things (one of L.P's most recent albums) helped me cope with the idea of dying and it being absolute. My dad and I spent a lot time blaring Linkin Park playing video games. We connect and I felt like a part of their life as much as them a part of mine. Knowing I won't get more music from someone who inspired me to be a musician hurts. I've been crying on and off since I found out. I know it's a stupid rant but no one else will listen. I love you guys, if anyone needs to talk about it PM me I need someone.

I guess I'll post more singing maybe not at work so I can actually project a bit. Thanks for the feed back on that too stranger.

I think I never sticked to a genre for so long, Trip hop is just awesome :) 
Would love to hear recommendations, playlist recs, or your opinion about it !

For those who don't know, here is a good description of it : 

**Trip hop :** *A blend of electronica and down-tempo hip-hop, urban and ethereal, street and ambience. Thought provoking, sensual, and deep. Often features string section and/or brass section. Can be either instrumental or with female vocals. Occasionally with rap. Trancy and smooth. Often jazzy. Sometimes features turntablism / scratching. It's head nodding music. ""Chill-out music"".* Brett Hansen 

**Edit :** Thanks for the gold and all your comments ! I'm listening to your suggestions, more additions to come :)

**Edit 2 :** Thanks again for all your attention. I made myself a playlist with all your submissions, I'm gonna have a lot to listen next weeks !"

The Anschutz Corporation — which owns concert giant AEG Live and its subsidiary Goldenvoice — gave $75,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association days after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

On June 24, the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the Republican Attorneys General Association reached out to its supporters with an urgent plea for money: “[E]very donation will help Republican Attorneys General combat the Democrats’ pro-abortion agenda and stand tall for life.”

Several days later, on June 29, according to a filing submitted to the IRS in July, the Anschutz Corporation — a massive holding company that famously owns the live music giant AEG Presents, the parent company of several major festivals, including Coachella — made a donation of $75,000 to RAGA. The money from Anschutz Corporation comes as RAGA gears up for election season with the aim of installing Attorneys General who will enforce and champion anti-abortion laws in key states where abortion rights remain in limbo, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida.

The Anschutz Corporation denies that it or its owner received, saw, or was aware of the RAGA fundraising solicitation, noting in a statement to Rolling Stone that they have been donating to RAGA since 2014 and that “[a]s a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.”

RAGA’s opposition to abortion rights is well-established. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a member of RAGA, was in charge of the legal strategy to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court case that overturned Roe. In July 2021, 24 of the 26 other members of RAGA submitted an amicus brief in support of Fitch. “The Court’s abortion precedent is erroneous, inconsistent, uneven, and unreliable,” the Republican Attorneys General wrote. “Roe and Casey should be overruled.” (The only current members of RAGA that didn’t sign the brief were New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who assumed office in April 2021, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who was elected after the brief was signed.)

AEG Presents and its subsidiary, Goldenvoice (which presents Coachella and Stagecoach), are just a couple of stars in the massive galaxy that is Anschutz Corporation’s holdings. Still, it is notable that Anschutz revenues will be used by RAGA to support these efforts, when part of that revenue is driven by ticket sales to concerts and festivals headlined by major artists who have been fiercely critical of conservative attacks on reproductive rights.

After a draft opinion of Dobbs leaked back in May, at least 15 artists who performed at Coachella this year — including Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, and Phoebe Bridgers — signed a full-page ad in The New York Times condemning the Court’s actions. “Our power to plan our own futures and control our own bodies depends on our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion,” the artists said in the ad. “We will not back down — and we will not go back.”

After the actual ruling was handed down, Harry Styles, another Coachella 2022 headliner, wrote on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the decision. Eilish, who performed at Glastonbury in the U.K. the day the decision was announced, told the crowd, “Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US.” And Megan Thee Stallion also used her Glastonbury platform to proclaim, “And I want to have it on the motherfucking record that the hot boys and the hot girls do not support this bullshit that y’all campaign for. My body is my motherfucking choice.”

Other Coachella 2022 performers who spoke out against the Dobbs ruling, or have supported pro-choice efforts in the past, include Maggie Rogers, Finneas, Arcade Fire, and Kim Petras. Beyond Coachella, the outspoken artist Maren Morris also played the AEG/Goldenvoice country festival Stagecoach this year (Brandi Carlile, who criticized the Dobbs decision, was scheduled to play Stagecoach too, but had to cancel due to Covid-19). And politically-minded acts like Halsey, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow are playing AEG’s Firefly Festival in Dover, Delaware in September.

Reps for Styles, Eilish, Finneas, Megan Thee Stallion, Arcade Fire, Morris, Halsey, Carlile, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow did not immediately return requests for comment; Petras, Rogers, and Bridgers were not immediately available for comment, according to their representatives.

In a statement to Rolling Stone, AEG responded as follows: “AEG, AEG Presents, Goldenvoice and its other subsidiaries, as one company, stands firmly in support of a woman’s right to choose. As owner and producer of many of the most inclusive festivals and venues on the planet, we have taken strides to make our position on this clear. On June 28, in the wake of the troubling overturning of Roe v. Wade and with the full support of The Anschutz Corporation, we informed all our employees that we will be covering travel and lodging expenses for women who need to leave their home state for reproductive health services including abortion. We remain, as ever, committed to choice, freedom, and access to full reproductive health options for women.”

In March 2022, records show that the Anschutz Corporation also contributed a combined $750,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund and the House Leadership Fund — super PACs seeking to put Republicans back in control of the House and Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell has said that, if his party regains control of Congress, he would consider a national abortion ban.

That the Anschutz Corporation donated $75,000 to RAGA, and larger amounts to other Republican committees, should not be a surprise. The company — which is owned by 82-year-old billionaire Philip Anschutz — has garnered plenty of attention and notoriety in the past for donations to right-wing groups, though his representatives have noted that he has also given to many other groups and tell Rolling Stone he does not “review or support each of the positions” taken by these groups.

The Anschutz Corporation’s statement, in full, reads: “As a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe. Neither The Anschutz Corporation (TAC), or Mr. Anschutz, received, saw or was aware of a Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) fundraising solicitation based on the reversal of Roe v. Wade. TAC has contributed to RAGA since at least 2014. No contribution to RAGA by TAC or Mr. Anschutz has been based upon, informed by, or motivated by any RAGA position on Roe or abortion. Mr. Anschutz makes contributions to numerous organizations, usually for specific reasons. He does not review or support each of the positions taken by such organizations.”

In 2017, Anschutz was criticized after his foundation reportedly donated to anti-LGBTQ groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Christian Foundation, and the Family Research Council. Anschutz denied accusations that he was anti-LGBTQ, calling the claims “fake news,” and adding, “I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation.”

At the time, Anschutz said he would stop funding any groups involved in anti-LGBTQ activities. And while contributions to the aforementioned groups did stop, Pitchfork reported in 2018 that Anschutz was still giving money to smaller organizations with a history of anti-LGBTQ statements and activities. Among them were the popular Christian youth ministry Young Life which, as of last year was welcoming LGBTQ youth, but not allowing them to serve as volunteers or staff members. (Following Pitchfork’s report, a lawyer for Anschutz said, “We are proud of the progress we have made in this regard, but there is always room for improvement.”)

Like many corporations after the Dobbs ruling, AEG promised last month to cover travel and lodging expenses for employees whose access to reproductive healthcare is under threat. “We understand that the issue of reproductive rights is deeply important to our employees, and we are committed to supporting you and your family with healthcare that continues to provide medical and prescription coverage for reproductive health services including abortions,” the company wrote in an email viewed by Rolling Stone.

The upcoming election in Wisconsin is a clear example of how critical Attorneys General races will be in a post-Roe world. The state’s current AG, Democrat Josh Kaul, has said he would “not investigate or prosecute” anyone in violation of the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which remained on the books, but was not enforced, after Roe was decided in 1973. Kaul also recently sued to block the ban after it was triggered by Dobbs.

The three Republicans aiming to unseat Kaul this November have all said they would enforce the state’s abortion ban if elected. And regardless of who wins the Republican primary for AG next month, the Republican Attorneys General Association will be ready to provide help, having already reserved $682,250 in TV ad time for spots opposing Kaul to run in October and November."

---

Spotify has become a huge part of my life, and I have been a Premium member for a few years now - mainly for offline listening but also for freedom and no adverts.

However, I recently opened up the ""This is: Hans Zimmer"" Official Spotify playlist to help me concentrate during the exam period, and noticed that the first ""song"" was actually an advert for an upcoming Spotify podcast and had absolutely nothing to do with Hans Zimmer 

[Screenshot here](https://imgur.com/PYnvsSn)

Even if it was related to Hans Zimmer, it still would have been unacceptable, especially since I am a paying customer paying for UNINTERRUPTED listening.

I managed to catch it before I started the playlist but imagine another person's surprise if they were listening to the playlist on shuffle and had their music experience interrupted by a 1 minute long advert with a lot of talking that was completely irrelevant to what they were listening to.

This is completely unacceptable from Spotify, and I hope that many of you will agree with this post, and that it will generate some exposure so that some action can be taken to stop this.

---

Edit: Wow, this really picked up some traction! I've been reading the comments and it has been very interesting to read both sides of the argument.

Firstly, I would like to agree with those calling me out for overreacting, and accept that my initial accusations against Spotify may have been a bit melodramatic. The ""advert"" is indeed a promotion for a Spotify podcast so they are well within their right to place it within a Spotify curated playlist. I also understand that my title may have insinuated that it was applying to ALL playlists, which does not seem to be the case.

However, I still stand by my disapproval of including a track that has no direct relation to the playlist I am listening to on shuffle - as I described in the original post, having a promotion with talking being played among instrumental pieces by Hans Zimmer would definitely be a little distracting, no matter whether it is related to the music genre or not. I feel Spotify could have gone for a less intrusive method to promote their new podcast that didn't involve putting it within a playlist where customers (especially those paying) expect to have a top quality listening experience.

And to those who say I can just create my own playlist or use other features to avoid these promotions, I believe that part of the price that I am paying for Premium should include the ability to simply click shuffle on a Spotify curated playlist and expect the best songs produced by that artist, being played at a high-quality, with minimal effort. I shouldn't be expected to go through EVERY song that Hans Zimmer has produced (which is a lot) just to put it in my own personal playlist. For me, Spotify has always been about ease of access to music.

Edit 2: Just had another look at the playlist and the promotion track has gone! Wow, I wonder if this post had anything to do with it...

Hey everyone! Happy Monday. If you're in America I hope you're enjoying the holiday :)

This post is a follow-up to **[my original post from a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/282bug/i_spend_my_free_time_developing_a_new_way_to/)**. I've been hard at work and wanted to give you all an update on where the project is at. So, after checking in with the mods and getting a thumbs-up, I decided it was time to make a post!

I've been developing a YouTube music player for almost three years. It's called **[Streamus](https://streamus.com)**. It is one of the most [well-received extensions in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/streamus/jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd/reviews). The software is free, the code is [open-source](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/), I have no interest in your personal data, and you already have an account if you're signed into Chrome. 

* Here are some screenshots of the new design: **http://imgur.com/a/vyd56**
* **[Here's a short, silent video of me using Streamus.](https://streamus.com/demo.html)**

True to my word in the first post, I quit my job to focus on Streamus full-time in July of last year. I do some contract work for a handful of hours each week to pay rent and buy food, but, other than that, I'm living on savings and focused on the project. Streamus does not make me any money. I actually lose a bit each month running the server. But... if you're into music for the money then you're in it for the wrong reasons. :)

Never heard of Streamus before? Here's a short list of features I commonly use:

* **[Keyboard Shortcuts](http://i.imgur.com/twhiwrH.png)** - Shortcuts can work with Chrome focused or globally. No more having to alt+tab to mute a song. Media keys work, too. 
* **[Radio](http://i.imgur.com/qaulh2M.png)** - Streamus offers something similar to Pandora/Spotify Radio. It is fueled by YouTube's ""Related Songs,"" but with a bit more logic on top to improve the results.
* **[Context Menus](http://i.imgur.com/CNmfnxj.png)** - Ever see a song mentioned without an accompanying URL? Just highlight the text, right-click, and play it. [Also supports right-clicking on YouTube URLs.](http://i.imgur.com/HL1CbrB.png)
* **[Omnibox](http://i.imgur.com/QhtjS3N.png)** - If you know the name of a song you want and don't need all the UI fluff then why not just use your URL bar?

So, that's me. How about you? What do you like and dislike about the service? What would you like to see more of in the future?

Looking forward to talking! Thanks for taking the time to read. 

Oh! And before I go, want some music? Here, have a playlist of some songs I'm currently jamming to: 

* https://share.streamus.com/playlist/f4ff11345c27/tropical_house_trap. 

I'm big into EDM. So, this playlist consists of tropical house and trap. Enjoy!

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

* **All I see is white / Streamus doesn't work**: Update your version of Google Chrome. Streamus requires v37 minimum, current is v39.

* **Firefox Support**: When I last investigated Streamus for Firefox I found that while FF's extension ecosystem is great, they don't appear to support the same ""Window Overlay"" as Chrome. This makes the general implementation of Streamus pretty difficult. If another developer is privvy to something I'm not, feel free to let me know, but, as it stands, waiting on FF to support Streamus rather than the other way around. 

* **Opera**: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/streamustm-beta/

* **Last.FM**: [It's on my TODO list.](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/116)

* **SoundCloud**: [It's on my TODO list](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/4) and [I've broken ground in coding it](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/blob/Development/src/js/background/model/soundCloudAPI.js)

* **Importing and Auto-Updating Playlists**: You can import playlists through the [Create Playlist](http://i.imgur.com/cw8TdTl.png) dialog. Playlists are currently static representations and do not auto-update when changes are made on YouTube, but [it's on my TODO list](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues/16)

* **Mobile**: No real plans for mobile currently. All the most popular YouTube music apps suddenly went missing from the app stores in December after YouTube updated their app to support background playback. I'd like to see how all that pans out before putting any effort into that space. Sorry, I know it's frequently requested.

Click here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3hgbr3/update_ryan_adams_tweeted_about_my_music_to/?)

I make music as Christopher the Conquered. Just over 1 week ago, Ryan Adams tweeted a photo of my new album (unreleased, it doesn't come out until next year) with the text: ""You guys @ctconquered is the real deal. This record is blowing my mind!!!"" Here's a link: https://twitter.com/TheRyanAdams/status/627930152379351040

He also posted it on Instagram with: ""This is a crazy and incredible record. Holy shit. Congrats @ctconquered"" Here's that link: https://instagram.com/p/55LLUtTDBl/


First of all, I need to say I am very thankful to Ryan for sharing my music. There's nothing in it for him, so it's just very sweet of him. So thank you, Ryan!

I have never met Ryan Adams. I played a show opening for the wonderful Natalie Prass and gave her an advance copy of the cd. It seems to have made its way from Iowa (where I live) to Los Angeles, where Ryan lives. Therefore, I owe Natalie a thank you, as well!

Obviously, I was very surprised to see these posts, and after overcoming the initial shock, it occurred to me that I should try to quantify the effect of these posts. We'll call it the ""Ryan Adams bump"". :)

So, 1 week later, what's happened? Well, I'm not playing on the late night circuit or anything like that, but I did get a lot of interest in my music. Here's how the last week has played out:

* Website Page Views - 2489 Views
* Youtube Videos: 1653 New Views
* Soundcloud: Single from Album - 572 Plays
* Facebook: 82 New Likes
* Instagram: 40 New Followers
* Twitter: 31 New Followers
* Spotify: 28 New Followers
* Email Newsletter: 12 Signups
* Internet Sales (Not including iTunes, Spotify, etc. - that takes a while to get those numbers): $86


I took a look at the analytics for what I could above (website, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) and for the rest I can basically speak anecdotally.

* My website was averaging about 30 page views a day before the posts. The day of the post, I got 999 page views. It's been dropping exponentially since then, about to be back to it's ""normal"" state. We'll see if the overall average ups a little.

* YouTube videos saw a 701% growth over the previous week! Whoa.

* The single off the album on Soundcloud had pretty much tapered off after its release in April around 900 plays, get a couple a day since the mid-June. It had 950 plays right when Ryan posted, that jumped up to 1572 within one week.

* Facebook was a 179% growth in likes from the previous week. Not bad.

* Instagram is hard to tell, definitely a jump in follows, though!

* Twitter analytics, interestingly, say that my increase was in line with growth since the beginning of July...I did play a big festival then...I would've expected a noticeable bump here.

* Spotify followers had definitely tapered off, so that was a noticeable boost! Now that I have over 250 followers though, I can verify my artist profile and get analytics on that...not sure if I'll be able to look back at this time period though. 

* I had zero email signups and zero internet sales the week before this, and honestly, my weekly averages had been close to zero for a while. So definitely a bump there. It'll be interesting to see how revenues from digital music outlets are affected.



Now I did get two other pieces of press in this week, one on Noisey.Vice.com and one on PureVolume.com (a new music video). So it's not clear that all of the increases are due strictly to the ""Ryan Adams bump"", but undoubtedly he gave me a lot of momentum. And experience tells me that those other press bits wouldn't amount to much.

What I'm curious about is if these numbers could be extrapolated to predict the effect of being personally advocated for by a celebrity? Taylor Swift (whose album 1989 Ryan Adams is currently creating a cover version of in the style of The Smiths) has 100 times the number of Twitter followers that Ryan does. Would it be reasonable to expect that if she posted about my music, I would see 100 times the above numbers in impact?

**Anyone else have experience with having your music posted by people with loads of followers?**

Anyway, thanks again to Ryan Adams, and if you want to hear the title track from the album he is touting, you can here: http://www.christophertheconquered.com/im-giving-up-on-rock-roll-single-2015/

my review (for what little it is worth): what I will say is it is a music video with a bunch of redneck dudes (1 semi hot chick as a media personality for whom he was making fun of), bikers, and like, what looked to be the inside of a newly smashed piñata of inbreds. The lyrics were bumper sticker lines conservatives think irritate or ""trigger libs"" but it just seemed more like an aged angry white man trying to convince the world that he still matters. 


bio: He wasn't talented. His parents paid into the system and convinced baby buttfuck that he was special; Grew up on a horse ranch in upstate Michigan or some shit, not some down-trodden Detroit suburb. Legit, I wouldn't be shocked to learn the video was filmed ON THE RANCH he grew up on. Then, everybody who needed something a little different from their normal constant droning faygo-induced ICP family fuckfests got someone else to impress their sister-cousin with on the new mixed tape. 

so basically, I didnt really enjoy it.

Edit: lol if you psychoanalyze strangers based on their opinions of Kid Rock over the Internet with words like “triggered,” just know that’s about the time all wind has been removed from your sails. It pleases me that my opinion/shitpost has touched so many lives lololol

Edit # 2: because of all the weird nerds I’ve pissed off, know that I dedicate their anger and this post’s success to the entire LGBTQ2 community with a heart full of love. Stay strong."

The Anschutz Corporation — which owns concert giant AEG Live and its subsidiary Goldenvoice — gave $75,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association days after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

On June 24, the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the Republican Attorneys General Association reached out to its supporters with an urgent plea for money: “[E]very donation will help Republican Attorneys General combat the Democrats’ pro-abortion agenda and stand tall for life.”

Several days later, on June 29, according to a filing submitted to the IRS in July, the Anschutz Corporation — a massive holding company that famously owns the live music giant AEG Presents, the parent company of several major festivals, including Coachella — made a donation of $75,000 to RAGA. The money from Anschutz Corporation comes as RAGA gears up for election season with the aim of installing Attorneys General who will enforce and champion anti-abortion laws in key states where abortion rights remain in limbo, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida.

The Anschutz Corporation denies that it or its owner received, saw, or was aware of the RAGA fundraising solicitation, noting in a statement to Rolling Stone that they have been donating to RAGA since 2014 and that “[a]s a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.”

RAGA’s opposition to abortion rights is well-established. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a member of RAGA, was in charge of the legal strategy to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court case that overturned Roe. In July 2021, 24 of the 26 other members of RAGA submitted an amicus brief in support of Fitch. “The Court’s abortion precedent is erroneous, inconsistent, uneven, and unreliable,” the Republican Attorneys General wrote. “Roe and Casey should be overruled.” (The only current members of RAGA that didn’t sign the brief were New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who assumed office in April 2021, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who was elected after the brief was signed.)

AEG Presents and its subsidiary, Goldenvoice (which presents Coachella and Stagecoach), are just a couple of stars in the massive galaxy that is Anschutz Corporation’s holdings. Still, it is notable that Anschutz revenues will be used by RAGA to support these efforts, when part of that revenue is driven by ticket sales to concerts and festivals headlined by major artists who have been fiercely critical of conservative attacks on reproductive rights.

After a draft opinion of Dobbs leaked back in May, at least 15 artists who performed at Coachella this year — including Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, and Phoebe Bridgers — signed a full-page ad in The New York Times condemning the Court’s actions. “Our power to plan our own futures and control our own bodies depends on our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion,” the artists said in the ad. “We will not back down — and we will not go back.”

After the actual ruling was handed down, Harry Styles, another Coachella 2022 headliner, wrote on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the decision. Eilish, who performed at Glastonbury in the U.K. the day the decision was announced, told the crowd, “Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US.” And Megan Thee Stallion also used her Glastonbury platform to proclaim, “And I want to have it on the motherfucking record that the hot boys and the hot girls do not support this bullshit that y’all campaign for. My body is my motherfucking choice.”

Other Coachella 2022 performers who spoke out against the Dobbs ruling, or have supported pro-choice efforts in the past, include Maggie Rogers, Finneas, Arcade Fire, and Kim Petras. Beyond Coachella, the outspoken artist Maren Morris also played the AEG/Goldenvoice country festival Stagecoach this year (Brandi Carlile, who criticized the Dobbs decision, was scheduled to play Stagecoach too, but had to cancel due to Covid-19). And politically-minded acts like Halsey, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow are playing AEG’s Firefly Festival in Dover, Delaware in September.

Reps for Styles, Eilish, Finneas, Megan Thee Stallion, Arcade Fire, Morris, Halsey, Carlile, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow did not immediately return requests for comment; Petras, Rogers, and Bridgers were not immediately available for comment, according to their representatives.

In a statement to Rolling Stone, AEG responded as follows: “AEG, AEG Presents, Goldenvoice and its other subsidiaries, as one company, stands firmly in support of a woman’s right to choose. As owner and producer of many of the most inclusive festivals and venues on the planet, we have taken strides to make our position on this clear.  On June 28, in the wake of the troubling overturning of Roe v. Wade and with the full support of The Anschutz Corporation, we informed all our employees that we will be covering travel and lodging expenses for women who need to leave their home state for reproductive health services including abortion. We remain, as ever, committed to choice, freedom, and access to full reproductive health options for women.”

In March 2022, records show that the Anschutz Corporation also contributed a combined $750,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund and the House Leadership Fund — super PACs seeking to put Republicans back in control of the House and Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell has said that, if his party regains control of Congress, he would consider a national abortion ban.

That the Anschutz Corporation donated $75,000 to RAGA, and larger amounts to other Republican committees, should not be a surprise. The company — which is owned by 82-year-old billionaire Philip Anschutz — has garnered plenty of attention and notoriety in the past for donations to right-wing groups, though his representatives have noted that he has also given to many other groups and tell Rolling Stone he does not “review or support each of the positions” taken by these groups.

The Anschutz Corporation’s statement, in full, reads: “As a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.  Neither The Anschutz Corporation (TAC), or Mr. Anschutz, received, saw or was aware of a Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) fundraising solicitation based on the reversal of Roe v. Wade.  TAC has contributed to RAGA since at least 2014. No contribution to RAGA by TAC or Mr. Anschutz has been based upon, informed by, or motivated by any RAGA position on Roe or abortion. Mr. Anschutz makes contributions to numerous organizations, usually for specific reasons. He does not review or support each of the positions taken by such organizations.”

In 2017, Anschutz was criticized after his foundation reportedly donated to anti-LGBTQ groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Christian Foundation, and the Family Research Council. Anschutz denied accusations that he was anti-LGBTQ, calling the claims “fake news,” and adding, “I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation.”

At the time, Anschutz said he would stop funding any groups involved in anti-LGBTQ activities. And while contributions to the aforementioned groups did stop, Pitchfork reported in 2018 that Anschutz was still giving money to smaller organizations with a history of anti-LGBTQ statements and activities. Among them were the popular Christian youth ministry Young Life which, as of last year was welcoming LGBTQ youth, but not allowing them to serve as volunteers or staff members. (Following Pitchfork’s report, a lawyer for Anschutz said, “We are proud of the progress we have made in this regard, but there is always room for improvement.”)

Like many corporations after the Dobbs ruling, AEG promised last month to cover travel and lodging expenses for employees whose access to reproductive healthcare is under threat. “We understand that the issue of reproductive rights is deeply important to our employees, and we are committed to supporting you and your family with healthcare that continues to provide medical and prescription coverage for reproductive health services including abortions,” the company wrote in an email viewed by Rolling Stone.

The upcoming election in Wisconsin is a clear example of how critical Attorneys General races will be in a post-Roe world. The state’s current AG, Democrat Josh Kaul, has said he would “not investigate or prosecute” anyone in violation of the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which remained on the books, but was not enforced, after Roe was decided in 1973. Kaul also recently sued to block the ban after it was triggered by Dobbs.

The three Republicans aiming to unseat Kaul this November have all said they would enforce the state’s abortion ban if elected. And regardless of who wins the Republican primary for AG next month, the Republican Attorneys General Association will be ready to provide help, having already reserved $682,250 in TV ad time for spots opposing Kaul to run in October and November."

They ~~charge~~ (see update) you an additional $12.95. You have 30 days to request a rebate via snail mail addressed to Rolling Stone **Refund**.

Screengrabs: http://imgur.com/a/J3kR8

UPDATE:

First, some of the comments say that you aren't charged initially. I declined the offer, so I don't know. Maybe you'd get billed a year later? It's a bit cryptic as the snail mail address is ""Rolling Stone **Refund**"". Even without a charge, it's a dirty trick.

Secondly, someone claiming to be from Live Nation PM'd me they would give me a whopping 30% discount on some tickets for deleting this post. I'd prefer they delete the underhanded, opt-out subscription BS on their site. Do you know how many times magazines sell your personal information? That's likely why the promotion is under the ""Privacy Information"" heading.

UPDATE 2:

I didn't expect this to get so much attention, and I wasn't around for several hours to see the upvotes. Still, the post title is totally accurate.

I think /u/Ca1amity made the clearest, best comment:

>No, the subscription isn't Free - That you are not being charged money for it does not equate to free.

>LiveNation is making money off of everyone they've tricked into this subscription. LiveNation is selling your billing and shipping information to 3rd parties for consideration. Those same people will sell your information on again at least once more.

>Just because some magazine you didn't really want will suddenly arrive at your door without any cash outlay doesn't mean you aren't being used. If the thing was at least somewhat above board it would be in a clear breakout box for you to opt in/out of not hidden down under ""privacy information.""

>And why under Privacy Information? Because they're going to be selling on your personal data and they probably have some duty to inform.

UPDATE 3:

I don't know if it's against TOS to post a PM along with username. It looked like an official LN account of some sort. I have a screengrab, but here is the PM text:

>Hey!

>Just to let you know, the Rolling Stone Magazine Promotion Live Nation has going on right now is actually one of the best magazine promotions out there today!

In that post, I discussed doing another post of collaborations, covers, and non-Linkin Park work that Chester had done.  
  
It's late, but here it is. While I'm sure I missed a bunch, I hope this will suffice. 
  
**Please note:** To make this list a manageable one, I've restricted it to being only efforts where Chester was involved. I could make a whole other post of collaborations and non-LP stuff that Mike Shinoda has done on his own.  

###1993-1998: Pre-Linkin Park Bands  
[Sean Dowdell and His Friends?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdQro4nM-JE) was a short-lived band formed in 1993. They recorded a three-track cassette, which has been linked. The band played around 50-70 shows around Phoenix before the band broke up, due in part to Chester constantly being late to practice.  
  
After that break-up, Sean Dowdell would start a new band named Grey Daze with Jonathan Krause, employing Chester Bennington once again as vocalist. The band put out two records: [Wake Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQOf3DU2gq4&list=PL8Wqgys3W3nY_3SjoC_1sTKX1ZGq0Rd0Z), which came out in 1994, and [...no sun today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2O5BQxOAS0) which came out in 1997. The band found minor success, but after receiving no meaningful looks or calls from major label executives after doing showcases in California, they eventually broke up.  
  
**Personal Recommendation:** [What's In The Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrVmdmKXyVw) off of ...no sun today  
  
###2001-2002: Hybrid Theory Live Covers and Guest Appearances  

Fast forward to 2001, and Linkin Park is in full tour mode. At this point, the band had one album out and, depending on where they were playing, either needed to pull earlier songs out (these were gone over in further detail in my post linked above) or play covers. In the early part of 2001, Bennington would do an acoustic rendition of [**Jane Says by Jane's Addiction**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpnwX62OGow) to start encores, although this cover was dropped after 5 shows. Infamously while vamping for some time after a song at Rock Am Ring, the group jokingly went into a 30-second cover of [Sweet Child o' Mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw_rcG8Lt_Y) by Guns N' Roses, the headlining band at the festival.

During the 2001	Family Values tour, Bennington would get to join Stone Temple Pilots on stage for a few songs. One such guest appearance, [Wonderful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVi3wlbSn1M), was recorded and placed on the Family Values live album. Chester was also known to come out and perform [Dead & Bloated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sw4slu5mPE) with the band, trading vocals with Scott Weiland. This would be interesting foreshadowing for later in Chester's career.  
  
He also joined Disturbed on stage during Ozzfest to perform [Pantera's Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7-3QfgSfYE) several times.
  
In late 2001, Chester would again do an acoustic rendition of a song during a Linkin Park encore. This song was an original of his, titled [Morning After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-H55HEYKI8), would eventually become a song for his side project Dead By Sunrise 8 years later.  
  
In 2002, Linkin Park would lead their very first headlining tour named **Projekt Revolution.** For this string of shows, the band added a cover song full-time to the set, [My Own Summer (Shove It) by The Deftones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wixN4-5WIGU). During this song, Mike Shinoda would often try (and many times fail) to get the crowd to yell the ""shove its"" during the chorus while Chester screamed himself crazy.  
  
###2001-2002: Studio Collaborations/Appearances  
  
In 2001, DJ Lethal of Limp Bizkit fame was working on a solo album. While the project was pushed back many years and eventually shelved, we did get snippets and eventually a full web release of his track featuring Chester. The track went under the working title ""State of the Art"" before finally becoming [Cry To Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q1-9zYpSUc).  

In 2002, Chester would lend his vocals to two tracks. One was the track [Karma Killer by Cyclefly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umPkis99iMI). Cyclefly toured with Linkin Park several times, both in the US and in Europe. Another one of Linkin Park's touring friends, Korn, would be the source of the second track. The Queen of the Damned soundtrack was written and performed by Korn's lead vocalist Jonathan Davis. However, his contract with Sony prohibited him from singing on the album (although his voice can be heard singing the soundtrack in the movie). To get around this, guest vocalists were brought in to perform the songs originally sung by Davis. Of these tracks, Chester sang [System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De4MX7lLaio), the third track on the record.
  
2002's **Reanimation** occurs in this timespan as well, but being a very popular remix album (the 4th best-selling remix album of all time, in fact), we will move in.  
  
###2003-2005: Meteora Era

In 2004 during their European tour, Linkin Park started playing a cover of Nine Inch Nails' track [Wish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLheapeGk10). This would be a regular addition to the set for the rest of the year, even warranting inclusion on one of the band's fan club Linkin Park Underground albums. An uncensored version of this release can be found [here (please note the video portion of this is identical to the previous link, only the audio is different.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JNV-5g_OGY). Also in 2004, Dan the Automator (of Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, and Kool Keith production fame) and Prince Paul (of De La Soul and countless other production fame)'s project Handsome Boy Modeling School released their second album. The feature guest look is unapologetically insane. RZA, Pharrell Williams, El-P, comedian Tim Meadows, Jack Johnson, The Mars Volta, Mike Patton, John Oates of Hall & Oates, Linkin Park, and more. The track Linkin Park featured in was [Rock and Roll (Could Never Hip Hop Like This) Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJITcTBaV6Q) and was comprised of four movements similar to the Four Seasons by Vivaldi, which is heavily sampled. Mike Shinoda raps in the second movement, while Chester sings in the fourth. It should be noted that a fan remix of Chester's section is often misattributed under the name ""Hardly Breathe"".  
  
2004 ends with the very highly regarded EP Collision Course, a mash-up EP of Linkin Park and Jay-Z. Meant to be the first in a series of MTV-sponsored mash-up albums, Collision Course ended up being the only effort in the ""series.""  
  
2005 would see three studio collaborations for Chester. The first is a track by DJ Z-Trip entitled [Walking Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJfrDV2_5W8) off Z-Trip debut album Shifting Gears. The second would be guest vocals on Nine Inch Nails' Head Like A Hole by Korn for a cover album titled Korn Kovers. This never saw release, but has been discussed by members of Korn as recently as last year. It has since become the Chinese Democracy of nu-metal albums. The third was a recording of [Home Sweet Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BTifMm6ejA) by Chester and original artists Mötley Crüe to benefit the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

Speaking of Hurricane Katrina charity benefits, the second Chester Bennington original song, [Let Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpSr65SPzCg), debuted live at ReAct Now: Music & Relief on cable television. However now the side project had a name, Snow White Tan, and was known to include members of the band Orgy as a supporting cast.

###2006-2008: Rap, Weeds, and Sadness  
  
Over the next 3 years, Chester would be recruited for guest vocals on a handful of rap tracks. Interestingly, the first would be a live performance by Linkin Park co-member Mike Shinoda's project Fort Minor. In 2006, both Fort Minor and Linkin Park were scheduled to play Japanese festival Summer Sonic. Fort Minor's hit song Where'd You Go would get a live performance in 2006 with [Chester taking lead on the chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7A0dWgjhw8). In 2007 Chester lent his vocals to another chorus, this time in the studio for at-the-time G-Unit member Young Buck, on the track [Slow Ya Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIjQRqtYnps). The last track in this span is Busta Rhymes' 2008 track [We Made it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYxzRYMrcVc), which would lead to the two touring together under the Projekt Revolution banner before Busta was dropped by his label, necessitating him to drop out of touring as well.  
  
Now, for the sadness: That 2008 Projekt Revolution tour also had Chris Cornell on the bill. Chris at the time was touring in support of his Timbaland-produced solo album Scream. Throughout this time, Chris would perform Temple of the Dog track [Hunger Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOKYyTRSO5A) with Chester joining in. Temple of the Dog was a project Chris Cornell made with the surviving members of Mother Love Bone after their lead singer died of an overdose. It should also be pointed out that July 20th, the day Chester died by suicide, is also Chris Cornell's birthday. So yeah. Sadness. I'm sorry.  
  
There's a better version of [Hunger Strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3NFsI2mJDE) available, I just wanted to link a version that had concert footage.  
  
During this tour, Chester would also join touring band Ashes Divide to perform a rendition of [A Perfect Circle's The Outsider.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RqZSENSNRs)  
  
And as a palette cleanser, Linkin Park did a very short cover of the track [Little Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WHrmybJ5Ro), most well-known for being the theme song to Showtime's Weeds. Season 3, which aired in 2007, had a cavalcade of artists covering the track for each episode. Other artists to join in this include Ben Folds, Death Cab for Cutie, Elvis Costello, Rise Against, and Regina Spektor.  
  
###2006-2012: Camp Freddy  
  
Camp Freddy was an all-star cover band with a revolving door of people jumping in for random cover songs of their friends, or even their own band. The most constant members of the band were Dave Navarro of Jane's Addiction, Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses, Billy Morrison of Billy Idol, and Chris Chaney of Jane's Addiction and Alanis Morissette's band.  
  
Examples of revolving guests? Slash of Guns N' Roses fame, Chad Smith of the Chili Peppers, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Ozzy Osbourne, Lana Del Rey, Brandon Boyd of Incubus, and, of course, Chester Bennington. Here is a list of some of the songs I've been able to find of Chester performing with Camp Freddy.  

- [AC/DC's Highway To Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKw1uPQpE70) with Slash  
- [Run DMC and Aerosmith's Walk This Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kh6wtuhiE) with Mike Shinoda  
- [Smashing Pumpkins' Bullet With Butterfly Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-lJN4JI1-s)  
- [Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuBW992uUQk) with Slash and Joe Satriani  
- [Guns N' Roses' Paradise City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kirIrSTHJoA) with Slash and Duff McKagan.  
- [Live's I Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIEVMwJs6rg) with Travis Barker  
- [Alice Cooper's I'm Eighteen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMXu0IwHwcA)
- [Jane's Addiction's Mountain Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncia7y9h4ew)  
- [Motörhead's Ace of Spades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWXMhv67NYk)  
- [Bob Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z5eWmF3peE)  
- [Beastie Boys' Fight For Your Right (To Party)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y1EQijCnDo) with Mike Shinoda
  
And, while not related to Camp Freddy (or even a full song), I felt this needed to be included. In 2006, Chester would get on stage with a band named Metal Skool and perform a cover of Dio's [Rainbow in the Dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R05vKInsg90). This band would later change their name to Steel Panther. This is the only clip that apparently exists of this appearance.  
    
###2007-2009: Dead By Sunrise  
  
Chester began working on his solo project in earnest, with the members of Orgy that played alongside him for the Hurricane Katrina relief concert. These musicians would form the band Julien-K, who toured under Linkin Park in 2007. As such, Bennington would frequently join them on stage for their songs [Technical Difficulties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jVXtRbJ8oI) and [Kick the Bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMaeTnqOwwY). Ironically, it's the latter song that has technical difficulties, and that's the only version of this live rendition that exists online.  
  
Chester's solo project, now known as Dead By Sunrise would release their debut (and only) album, [Out of Ashes](https://open.spotify.com/album/34Zz8qH5QJgD2uTXDuZ2J9?si=CUJH7vf9QkyzsGPe71kjIQ&dl_branch=1) in 2009. The album includes studio versions of previously mentioned songs like Let Down and Morning After, with the latter being a [bonus track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlwCU9G-eFc) for the Japanese release of the album. In 2018, demo versions of half the songs were found on a [restrict release watermarked CD](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRCZGc7dsxZnCsld6i5GJWem_xyh3Ngja) that was released by fansite LPLive. This CD also includes a cover of 20 Eyes by The Misfits.  
  
**Personal Recommendations for Out of Ashes:** Fire, Let Down, Give Me Your Name, Walking in Circles, In the Darkness. Honestly, everything on Out of Ashes except for My Suffering and Condemned.  
**Personal Recommendations for Demo CD:** The demo of My Suffering is a HUGE recommend. It's so much better than the album version. Also, the cover of 20 Eyes.  
  
###2010-2012: Covers
  
The next few years were defined by covers. In 2010, Bennington would lend his vocals to Santana's cover of [Riders On The Storm by The Doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYxWF-A2zq4). This was part of a cover album titled Guitar heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time and featured guests like Chris Cornell, Yo-Yo Ma, Pat Monahan of Train, and Nas.  
  
The covers would continue in the form of Linkin Park's live shows. In 2011, the band would go viral with their performance of [Adele's Rolling in the Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtwZ07N1ic) at the iTunes Festival becoming a radio hit in the UK. In 2012, the band would incorporate a portion of [Sabotage by the Beastie Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqQ1HiKLRc8) into their live shows in honor of the (at the time) recently departed MCA. Generally, they would put it into the bridge of their closer Bleed It Out.  
  
###2013-2015: Stone Temple Pilots  
  
The story that began with Chester's guest appearances with Stone Temple Pilots in 2001 comes full circle in 2013, when he joined the band as their lead vocalist. In interviews predating this, Bennington had stated that being a member of STP was a lifelong dream. An EP named [High Rise](https://open.spotify.com/album/61XZkrTQMo602r1e5rgRka?si=nllU1hblQeWfNKfpMtukiA&dl_branch=1) was released by the group and they would tour proper for a few years, before Chester left the band due to Linkin Park commitments.  
  
**Personal Recommendations:** Out Of Time, Same On The Inside, Tomorrow  
  
###2013-2017: Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Lonely Island
  
In 2013, Linkin Park would begin a music partnership with EDM artist Steve Aoki. The first track to come out of this is [A Light That Never Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsKQOm_iJug), which falls more on the Linkin Park side, musically. This track would be included in Recharged, Linkin Park's remix album for Living Things. The second track in this partnership comes out in 2015 and is named [Darker Than Blood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPtxGC95LxE). As hinted at by my first sentence, this track would fall more on the Aoki side of the spectrum.  
  
After a string of successful viral hits, The Lonely Island made a movie in 2016 titled Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping. One of the tracks, [Things In My Jeep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LJ3aYw8Brs), were made featuring Bennington and Shinoda. While the version in the movie does not include their contributions, the album version of the song in full includes Bennington's chorus, complete with back-up screams.  
  
In 2017, Chester, Mike, and Joe Hahn of Linkin Park would join Ken Jeong for an episode of Carpool Karaoke. While it was delayed due to Chester's death, the episode was [eventually released on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2040457085969998). It includes the group singing [Hey Ya by Outkast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlSM3Gt03LQ), [Under The Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUZPzmicP0Y), Sweet Home Alabama, and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing.  
  
Yeah, it's all really silly stuff. But sometimes you just need silly stuff.  
  
###2017: Jane Says  
  
At the beginning of the post, I shared an old acoustic rendition of Chester performing Jane Says by Jane's Addiction. It seems fitting, then, that we wrap up with [Chester performing the song again in May of 2017.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_5i63cK-vY) In this video he is showing off the new guitar he had purchased that would becoming his touring guitar for the One More Light tour. Comparing the two versions of the cover is like a night and day experience. I highly recommend going back to listen to that first version before playing this one.  
  
###The Morning After  
  
The years following his death would see a small trickle of music relating to Chester Bennington come out. Most notably, Mark Morton of Lamb of God released [Cross Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv8oTQWaxwc), which Chester on lead vocals, in 2019.  
  
In 2020, Sean Dowdell and company would dust off, remaster, and add new instrumentals to old Grey Daze tracks and release the remix album [Amends](https://open.spotify.com/album/67HpukNc3CzJhqYneGVim6?si=5vYlT7JpQTe4D8YzEsN74g&dl_branch=1).  
  
And this year, Slash previewed a snippet of a track called [Crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRlbimg1UT8) that featured Chester but was not used for his solo album due to label issues. The track eventually became Doctor Alibi, which was a collaboration with Lemmy of Motörhead. Per Slash, it is up to the Bennington estate as to whether they want to release Crazy.  
  
**And that's it for this post.** I hope you had a good time going through a little bit of history and listening to some music today. I'm thinking next year I will do a similar post for **Chris Cornell** as my username, after all, is a portmanteau of my two vocal heroes: ""Fell on Black Days"" being a Soundgarden track and ""Grey Daze"" obviously being Chester's old band. If this is something you'd be interested in, please let me know."

The cheapest I could find five minutes after the first presale started were $200 USD plus fees for back for the upper bowl. At that point, they weren’t even resellers. Ticket prices were just inflated from Ticketmaster due to their new “dynamic pricing”. To me that’s straight price gouging with fees on top. Even if I wanted to spend over $500 all in on two tickets for terrible seats, I couldn’t.

We got hacked last week - someone stole Thom’s minidisk archive from around the time of OK Computer, and reportedly demanded $150,000 on threat of releasing it.

So instead of complaining - much - or ignoring it, we’re releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of Extinction Rebellion: https://radiohead.bandcamp.com

Just for the next 18 days. So for £18 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom.

Never intended for public consumption (though some clips did reach the cassette in the OK Computer reissue) it’s only tangentially interesting. And very, very long. Not a phone download. Rainy out, isn’t it though?

Donald Trump kicked off his third bid for the White House on Tuesday night (Nov. 15) at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and within an hour the twice-impeached one-term former president was already facing his latest threat of legal sanction.

In the midst of a nest of investigations into Trump’s actions before and during his tumultuous four-year term, the estate of late R&B/soul legend Isaac Hayes tweeted that it was exploring its legal options to stop the former reality star from using one of Hayes’ compositions at his campaign events. “Once again, the estate and family of Isaac Hayes DID NOT approve the use of ‘Hold On I’m Coming’ by Sam and Dave by Donald Trump at his 2024 Presidential announcement tonight,” read the tweet from the reps for the singer/composer who died in 2008 at age 65.

“We are exploring multiple legal options to stop this unauthorized use,” it warned. Hayes co-wrote the 1966 hit and in a subsequent tweet the estate added, “Stopping a politician from using your music is not always an easy task, but we are dedicated to making sure that Donald Trump does not continue to use ‘Hold on I’m Coming’ by written by Isaac Hayes an David Porter in further rallies and public appearances.”"

With a few exceptions, it seems like everyone gets the same awards every year as a way to pat themselves on the back for singing music that is usually not even written by them. I'm sorry but I just don't get it. And Megadeth gets the best metal album of the year award, obviously because they're a metal band and released an album this year. Is there any thought that goes into picking the winners of each category? Gojira, Obscura, Vektor, all released fantastic albums this year. 



Maybe I'm wrong but it seriously feels like the grammys are a joke. Could they not do a better job of recognizing artists talents, rather than their commercial success?


Discuss


edit: I guess the word I thought of when I saw the list of winners was ""incestuous"" if thats even a word. Its just weird seeing all these people who all make the ""news"" by gossiping with eachother, those same people all getting rewards that seem absurd for them. It's like everyone in the kindergarten class winning an award for something minor at the end of the year, and gettig an icecream party. Moreso, its an excuse for cheap stunts, like Adele breaking her award in half, because obviously Beyonce deserved it more."

I often have the feeling like I cant breathe even, and then as these emotions are about to reach it's max I just gasp for air and start crying. It actually feels extremely euphoric, as if nothing on earth is there except me and my thoughts.

>Fans trying to purchase seats for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, which went on sale this morning, were irate at Ticketmaster for long waits, technical glitches and outright site crashes.

>Some compared it to The Hunger Games. Overwhelming demand from the same fans who had rocketed 10 songs from Swift’s most recent release Midnights to the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 — a first-time feat in the chart’s history — caused what Ticketmaster characterized as “intermittent issues with the site.” Potential ticket buyers complained of waiting hours with little to show for it. Others said they were being automatically logged out without being allowed to complete their purchases.

>Rolling Stone reported that “As of 11 a.m. on Tuesday, the site was experiencing major issues, with fans either completely logged out or in a queue 2,000-plus people strong that appeared frozen.”

>One famous Millennial echoed decades-long calls for legal action against the service.

>House Rep. Alexandra Oscasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter this morning, “Daily reminder that Ticketmaster is a monopoly, it’s [sic] merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned in. Break them up.”

>A fan added context to the Congresswoman’s call by replying with a photo of Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard on Capitol Hill in 1995 reminding that “@PearlJam were aware of these monopolistic practices back in 1995. They even testified before congress regarding the issue.” The group at the time also filed a complaint against the ticketing giant with the U.S. Justice Department and tried to set up an alternate ticket-buying channel.

>Ticketmaster posted several Twitter updates this morning as the site’s issues escalated. Among them was advising fans not to log in through the Ticketmaster web site, which was experiencing “unprecendeted demand,” but to initiate purchases through the presale links texted to them.

>The ticketing service pushed back presales for a number of West Coast cities from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. today. A presale for Capitol One cardmembers was pushed to tomorrow."

They have different chord changes/progressions, different vocal melodies, structures, lyrics, and many other elements.  If this is enough to sue, we can probably do this for every song on the Hot 100!

I'll start with #1:
Mark Ronson ft Bruno Mars - Uptown Funk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0
and..
The Time - Jungle Love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=919Gt1SczVY

See! I hear the same beat/groove and similar funk guitar! Lawyers, furrow your brows and begin shouting!

Edit: Front paaaage, thanks contributors!
Keep in mind sampling is different; if you literally use someone’s sound recording (which is tied to a composition), you’re dead to rights and owe the original songwriters a share. This usually isn’t a problem anymore as most samplers ask/pay before they release. The reason I find this verdict controversial is because the jury was convinced that these 2 different songs were similar enough (based on just that one groove as far as I can tell, which is not copyrightable) to warrant copyright infringement. TL;DR: Verdict probably not based on real laws.

Update:Our high school administration revoked their previous decision to decline the prize. As a result we will receive the $10k grant and a presentation on the music industry from Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. 

I would like to thank the reddit communities of /r/music and /r/hiphopheads for any support given for my school.  

Now I can go back to not liking Macklemore

However, due to complaints of parents and administration at Aliso Niguel High School, that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis promote misogyny and Drug Use, had to decline the concert and grant money. I find this atrocious. I might not be a fan of MRL, however I find it silly that concerned parents are portraying Mack as a misogynistic drug enabler. As a member of the high school Orchestra, the $10,000 was the most important part of the contest, as expenses pile up fast especially when split between choir and band. 

Many of our student body is upset at the administration's decision and unwillingness to reach a compromise.

I'd like to take this opportunity to share some lesser known non-album tracks so that those who miss him or Linkin Park can have ""new"" music to listen to.",19531,0.89,542,2019-07-20 22:11:14,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/cfnuab/chester_bennington_passed_away_2_years_ago_today/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/cfnuab/chester_bennington_passed_away_2_years_ago_today/,self.Music,0,5,,text,False,False,False,"Through the nearly 2 decades that Chester Bennington was in Linkin Park, a lot of music got made. A lot of that music never made it onto an official album release. Instead, a great majority were released on yearly discs for the LP fan club, known as the LP Underground. Some still were released through various other means. Below, in roughly chronological order, are finished (in most cases) tracks that a non-hardcore fan may not have heard before:  
  
**Slip (circa 1999)**  
[Slip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbrrvzsUF4) originate from when Linkin Park were known as Xero, pre-Chester. The song was redone once Chester joined the band. This demo was eventually released on LPU11 in 2011.  
  
**Blue (circa 1999)**  
[Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4xH8UZo9qA) is a song that the band largely considered crap. They would end up recording it, but abandoned almost all of it later. The bridge, however, the band actually liked. They took the vocals from that section, and with new words and new chords underneath, created the chorus to Hybrid Theory hit Crawling. Blue would also see release on LPU11 in 2011.  
  
**So Far Away (circa 1999)**  
[So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgV2BaKChuU) is the earliest instance of rapper/guitarist/pianist/bassist/producer Mike Shinoda singing on lead vocals, almost a decade before he would do so on Minutes to Midnight. The chorus is interesting in that it has Mike singing with Chester almost rapping his lines in a call-and-response manner, a reversal of the formula that brought Linkin Park to fame. So Far Away was released to fans on LPU12 in 2012.  

**Dedicated (circa 1999)**  
[Dedicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4NVy0oPtR8) is a rap-centric track written by Mike leading into the Hybrid Theory sessions. A few interesting facts on this one: the version of Dedicated that was released is censored, with the word ""shit"" being muted. This is the only version of the song that exists for public consumption. Further, Dedicated would be sampled in future collaboration with legendary DJ group The X-Ecutioners on It's Goin' Down. Dedicated was released in 2002 on LPU2.  
  
**Step Up (circa 1999)**  
[Step Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYoLCNvQtf8) is a rap song that originates from the Hybrid Theory EP from 1999. At this point in the band's career, Hybrid Theory was the name of the band rather than Linkin Park. This would end up changing as there was an existing band named Hybrid. Chester would recommend the name Lincoln Park to the rest of the band as he passed a park by that name on his way to the studio every day. This EP was released in very limited numbers in 1999, but was eventually rereleased in 2001 for the LPU, technically making it LPU1. Step Up was a popular song to be played live by the band throughout their nu-metal era. The song would also later be sampled by the band on It's Goin' Down and Reanimation track Kyur4 Th Ich.  
  
**And One, Carousel, and Part of Me (circa 1999)**  
[And One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB4yACNasqE), [Carousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtPay1Ubk-Q), and [Part of Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C29XoZeAwE8) are also songs from the Hybrid Theory EP. Unlike Step Up, however, the band would keep these songs in consideration for their debut album, rerecording them and adding parts through the Hybrid Theory recording sessions. Interestingly, since these are demos for the ALBUM Hybrid Theory but also got an official release on the Hybrid Theory EP the year earlier, you get an interesting scenario where the ""demo versions"" of these three songs are actually more recent than the ""official releases."" I've linked the demo versions in this post. These were included in demo CDs to get word out about the band. Speaking of demo CDs...
  
**She Couldn't (circa 1999)**  
[She Couldn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OYeXDryPCs) was a track found on a Hybrid Theory demo CD. It's a clear indicator that, even as they were developing their breakout nu-metal sound, Linkin Park were willing to experiment with drastically different sounds. She Couldn't is softer, vocally, than anything that could be heard at this point from Chester, and featured a sparse guitar lead and a synth breakdown. It was included on an 8-track demo to distribute for internal use or as promo material. She Couldn't holds the distinction of being one of the longer songs Linkin Park has ever written, clocking in over 5 minutes in length. This would not be beat by a non-remix track until 2006. As it stands, the only songs that clock in at a longer duration by the band are The Little Things Give You Away off Minutes to Midnight, The Catalyst off A Thousand Suns, Guilty All the Same off The Hunting Party, and A Line in the Sand off the same album. This song did not see official release, presumably due to sampling B-Boy Document '99 by High & Mighty. You might know THAT track from Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. She Couldn't went undiscovered by Linkin Park fans until copies of this promo CD showed up on eBay in 2009.   
  
**Regarding 1999 Demo CDS: The above demo CDs also include early demo versions of songs like In The End, Crawling, A Place For My Head, and Points of Authority that end up on the Hybrid Theory album. Some of them are vastly different than the version we got. I'm not going to write them up here since they ended up on a studio album, but feel free to go listen to them yourself!**  
  
**QWERTY (circa 2006)**  
[QWERTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP-8qFJ7pZo) was written and recorded during the sessions for Minutes to Midnight. It came about due to the band wanting to debut a new song for their shows in Japan in 2006. The band had actually been planning to play a song with the working title Grecian, but last minute decided to scrap it and write a new song instead. Thus, QWERTY was born. After the Japan shows in August, the band would record the song and release it on LPU6 that December.  
  
**Chance of Rain (circa 2006)**  
[Chance of Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgTMlOQ3bks) is one of many tracks that did not make the cut for 2007 album Minutes to Midnight. It's on the mellow side of what Linkin Park were producing in this period. Mike Shinoda stated that the song did not make the cut due to the band feeling like there were too many mid-tempo songs being considered for the album, like Leave Out All The Rest, In Between, or Valentine's Day. Chance of Rain was released on LPU15 in 2015.  

**Across The Line (circa 2007)**  
[Across The Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9MrdsuQfNE) is another song that did not make the cut for 2007 album Minutes to Midnight. Under the working title Japan, this song can be heard being demoed out in the accompanying DVD for that album. It holds the distinction of being the last song to be cut from the album of all the songs that were recorded during this period. Across The Line was released to the LP Underground on LPU9.  
  
**Blackbirds (circa 2007)**  
[Blackbirds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNrDe3ATl5I) is yet another song that did not make the cut for Minutes to Midnight. This song made it far enough into the recording process to have orchestral strings arranged by David Campbell recorded for them. The song was ""released"" as part of Linkin Park mobile game 8-Bit Rebellion! (sic) in 2010.  
  
**No Roads Left (circa 2007)**  
[No Roads Left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mchhPf81iw) is, you guessed it, a song that was cut from Minutes to Midnight. This is probably the most well-known of this batch, as it was a bonus track on some editions of that album. Recording of this song can be seen in the Making of Minutes to Midnight DVD, where Chester and Mike tell the story of how Chester insisted that Mike's voice was better for the song.  
  
**What We Don't Know (circa 2007)**  
[What We Don't Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE9t74VmUyA) is, well, look at the year and figure it out. Despite reaching the mixing stage of the album recordings (it was mixed by Neal Avron, who mixed the entirety of Minutes to Midnight), the song is considered unfinished by the band. What We Don't Know was released on LPUX in 2010.  
  
**Pretend To Be (circa 2006-2008)**  
[Pretend To Be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z51GGSBv9Bg) began as a song from the Minutes To Midnight recording sessions, but would be reworked and re-recorded in 2008. The song has a rarity for LP tracks, an instrumental breakdown outro that reduces to drum and bass before building back up. Pretend To Be was released on LPUX in 2010.  
  
**I Have Not Begun (circa 2009)**  
[I Have Not Begun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy3ybFruYRE) is a Mike Shinoda-centric rap song that was recorded during the sessions for album A Thousand Suns. The track was built around recordings of Mike creating a static buzz by touching a gauge cable with his finger while plugged into an amp. I Have Not Begun was released on LPUX in 2010.  
  
**Not Alone (circa 2006-2010)**  
[Not Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrbL1s9qwBs) originates from the Minutes to Midnight sessions. It was untouched for a few years until the catastrophic earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010. The band, who runs the charity Music For Relief, worked with other artists to create the compilation album Download to Donate for Haiti. People were encouraged to either download the compilation with proceeds going to relief efforts, or to donate to relief efforts. Other artists who contributed to this album were Slash, Peter Gabriel, Alanis Morissette, Dinosaur Jr., and more. The album was released in January 2010 and raised $270,000.  
   
**Primo (circa 2010)**  
[Primo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6mbMmunQa8) was a song that began during recording sessions for 2010 album A Thousand Suns. It would later be reworked into [I'll Be Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1wM5ljye28), a song featured on 2012 album Living Things. Among the hardcore LP fanbase, Primo is considered to be highly superior to I'll Be Gone. This demo would see release in 2013 on LPUXIII.  
  
**The Last Line (circa 2007-2014)**  
[The Last Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uiBKDkS690) began as a demo titled ""Ammosick"" during the Minutes to Midnight recordings. Vocally, it is a Mike Shinoda-centric song and definitely has elements that date it to those 2007 sessions. Despite not being considered for that album (though it reached the mixing stage of that album), the song idea would persist with the band, as evidenced from their Meeting Of A Thousand Suns documentary. At one point, a song board can be seen with titles of songs being considered/worked on, including The Last Line. The song would be used by Linkin Park's DJ, Joe Hahn's directorial debut Mall. While The Last Line is credited as Ammosick in the film, the official soundtrack release that came in 2014 finalizes the title.  
  
**Devil's Drop (circa 2011-2014)**  
[Devil's Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EnkwS_M6Nc) was created during the recording sessions for 2012 album Living Things. Like The Last Line, it features Mike Shinoda taking lead vocals and playing the guitar loop that forms the basis of the song. The guitar loop was recorded on an iPhone so that Mike would not forget it, and thus features background chatter from the rest of the band. Devil's Drop was also released in 2014 for the Mall soundtrack.  
  
**It Goes Through (circa 2011-2014)**  
[It Goes Through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjGdzDj9qXc) is another song from the batch of Living Things demos that end up on the Mall soundtrack. Like the other two songs we've seen from this soundtrack, the song is largely Mike Shinoda on vocals, though Chester is (along with the other two) credit as a writer.  
  
**White Noise (circa 2012-2014)**  
[White Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlitEk_pJt0) is the sole Chester-centric song off the Mall soundtrack. Not much is known about the origins of this one. As it was recorded for Mall, it existed in some for at least by 2012. The lyrics of the song can be seen in YouTube videos documenting the launch of 2014 album The Hunting Party. Fittingly for that album's style, White Noise has a dirtier, guitar-based instrumental than the other 3 Mall songs. It would be released for free download by Linkin Park in 2014.  
  
**What Are You Worth (circa 2016)**  
What Are You Worth is a demo from the One More Light sessions. It is a Mike-centric song, and is decidely more rock-focused than other songs from those sessions. What Are You Worth was leaked to the public in 2019. There is no link for this song largely because it was not meant for release and I would like respect the band and label's wishes to not share this song.  
  
**Looking For An Answer (circa 2017)**  
[Looking For An Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labrkIEGxyA) is, as of today, the last song written for/under the name of Linkin Park. This song does not exist in album form, and was written by Mike Shinoda after Chester passed away. It was performed at the Celebrate Life memorial concert for Chester.  
  
I hope everyone is doing well today. Thank you for sticking around through this whole post, and I hope you found some new Linkin Park songs to enjoy, even if they are old."

This year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts and Stagecoach festivals will no longer require attendees to wear masks or provide negative COVID-19 test results, Rolling Stone and Variety point out. Stagecoach announced the news via social media earlier today. Coachella did not make an announcement via social media, but the health and safety guidelines on the festival website has been updated to communicate the new guidelines. “In accordance with local guidelines, there will be no vaccination, testing or masking requirements at Coachella 2022,” it reads. Pitchfork has reached out to festival organizers Goldenvoice for further information and comment.

Back in October, Coachella and Stagecoach announced that they would no longer require full vaccination for attendees at the 2022 festival. The new changes in COVID-19 protocol follow California’s statewide termination of mask mandates, which went into effect today. The updated guidelines will still require vaccinated people to wear masks in some settings, such as K-12 schools, on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. Masks will be required for unvaccinated people inside of churches. There will no longer be a requirement to provide a negative test result to visit hospitals and nursing homes.

Elsewhere in its health and safety guidelines, Coachella’s website states that protocol “may change at any time as determined by federal, state or local government agencies.” These changes may include “proof of vaccination and/or negative COVID-19 test, and other protective measures such as requiring attendees to wear face coverings.”

Coachella is scheduled for the weekends of April 15-17 and 22-24, 2022. Kanye West, Billie Eilish, and Harry Styles are set to headline. Both the 2020 and 2021 editions of the festival were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

The harassment began when they left the organization, but continued to escalate after his wife Chrissie Carnell Bixler spoke out about Danny Masterson’s behavior. (Hyde/ That 70’s Show)

At least 8 women have now filed rape/sexual assault charges against Masterson now. 

Cedric maintains that his family is routinely harassed, stalked, and threatened by both members of the organization and private investigators hired on their behalf for continuing to speak out against the behavior of their members. Apparently, rather than kicking these people out, they choose to try to cover it up.

Last night he made two posts regarding the death of his dog Biscuit. She was rushed to the vet after she had been found very ill. They found meat filled with rat poisoning in their yard. This is the second dog they’ve had to put down for being poisoned. 

Fuck these people. 
EDIT: If you’re seeing this PLEASE share the post and leave comments if you have the time. If this Actually gets real traction we could really make a difference in these people’s lives. Just remember that it only took a lot of people sharing a #metoo to finally get people upset enough about Weinstein.

last friday, i released my second album, ""Nurture"", which is a project that took me about 6 years on-and-off.  after ""Worlds"", i felt this really strong need to write an album that explored the beauty of reality and of the everyday, but as i'm sure we'll get into here, it was one of the hardest (and most worthwhile!) things i've ever done.

here's the new album ""nurture"" ! https://porterrobinson.com/nurture

feel free to ask me anything!

i'm also really interested in speaking about creativity more broadly, since it's something i've thought about a lot over the last few years.

I found this out fair recently, but Eminem actually personally writes his own annotations and other random thoughts on the website, and in typical Eminem fashion, he's both fascinating and hilarious. 

Here are some examples: 

> Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture.

Eminem: ""I wrote this line because I had recently had a sharkskin floor installed in my home. Hence…Jaws.""

> And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch

Eminem: ""I feel like this show doesn’t get enough love. It was funny as fuck and gross at the same time.""

> Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too
And spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

Eminem: ""This is my 5th attempt at trying to kill Dre. I’m kinda surprised he still wants to be my friend.""

>Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

Eminem: ""Every time I have had a court issue since this line, I’ve been asked to provide the wardrobe for my legal team. Shout out to Mr. Alan’s and Diettrich furs for keepin’ everyone crispy…29 or 2 for 50…""

I released a single 'Moments' and my 'Moments' album Extended Mixes version with several brand new remixes and all extended mixes for DJs to play a couple of months ago. I also had a couple of official remixes and this fun collaboration with Rovio's Angry Birds game update just recently released, so I thought it would be fun to come back on reddit and catch up with you guys!

I just spent the last half hour watching the ticketmaster page for Bon Iver's December 10th concert at the Hammerstein in NYC. As soon as the timer ran out it went to a loading page and it felt like it was taking too long so I refreshed after about 10 seconds. It immediately loaded the ticket page with a quantity of 2 standard tickets in the best available section, which is what I wanted (it's GA on the floor). I hit search and had to do the security check *TWICE* (I SELECTED ALL THE FUCKING STREET NUMBERS GODDAMNIT) and then the page loaded and said there were no more tickets. 

There was a maximum of 30-45 seconds between when the tickets went on sale and when I got through the security check.

Buying tickets is nonsense and has to be fixed."

A lot of famous musicians also acknowledged similar problems due to not wearing earplugs at concerts.

When I was 22, one of my friends in the music industry recommended wearing earplugs -- she recommended EarPeace (\~$25), which are reusable earplugs that musicians wear and they're always attached to my keys. Alternatively, you can get the disposable ones that are 24/$4.99 at a local drug store. My hearing is fine because of this sage advice from my friend.

People will think the contrary but it improves the listening experience.

You can't love your favorite artists if you can't hear them. Stan your ears.

Edit: Even if you already suffer from tinnitus/hearing loss, earplugs can help! Chris Martin said that wearing earplugs has helped with his tinnitus.

Edit 2: Other brands recommended by other Redditors: Earasers, Etymotic, Eargasms, Hearos, Party Plugs, custom-fitted earplugs

Edit 3: Redditors suggest that music venues may have them at the bar if you forget them at home!"

I love just about all music and I love going to shows.  There's something about being a part of the masses moving together as one.  I've seen big venue, little venue, clubs.  I love it.  But there's been something missing...

When I was 18 I had a really bad experience at a club I went to in Philly to see, of all people, Rob Base and DJ Easy Rock.  I'd seen them the night before but this second show, I was one of the only white people there and the show had an entirely different tone to it to the point where I felt excluded almost to the point where I felt unsafe.

This sucks because my favorite genre is Hip Hop.  I was a big Public Enemy/BDP fan and grew up in white washed Midwest suburbs before moving to the Philly area.  I was made fun of and bullied for my music choices and excluded, so my Rob Base experience pretty much made me uncomfortable with the idea of going to a hip hop concert.  

That was in 96.  I saw Common and a 50 cent concert from VIP boxes and outside of a very random 'The Streets'' show, I've forever put off setting my favorites live while in the crowd.  

Until last night. 

Another dad (who happens to be a teacher who teaches kids how to express themselves lyrically) invited me to go with him to see Denzel Curry (Who I absolutely love) at the Fillmore.  He said it would be fun and have a lot of energy and that the crowd would be young.  We could hang out on the side and watch it all go down.  

After reading about and seeing the Travis Scott stuff, I had my reservations.  I'm not particularly fit and while I love a good mosh pit, I wasn't sure what to expect so I was feeling reserved.  

The opening acts were incredible and so full of energy that I began to develop anxiety about being there on the sidelines, but everything was so aggressive and watching the water get passed around between sets was making me feel like I was out of my element.  

But something weird happened in my brain.  I thought if I were there with this other guy who had experienced this, that I should at least give it a go and, being good at navigating crowds I got us center stage about ten ft away.  

As I looked around me, I realized that the crowd was this incredible amalgam of male and female and all colors.  There was a young black kid, at least 20 years my junior, that I turned to to ask if he was okay with where I was and he said 'Yeah man, ain't nobody going down tonight' and I suddenly felt safer and that 18 year old me just wanted to cry at that moment.  

Needless to say, the concert was insane.  I had to make my way out and back in a couple times because, well, I'm old and out of shape.  But not once did I feel afraid and it was amazing.  

I have to say, I'm proud of young people and their ability to be so inclusive.  That experience was probably the greatest concert experience I've ever had because it broke so many things open for me and gave me hope for my kids who I hope to take to a show like that in the next 4-5 years when I think they can handle it.  

So that's my story.  I'm sore as hell, but full of life after that.  To the younger generation, keep doing your thing.  You all are amazing and coming together even more at a time when the world from my view feels like it's coming apart.  

Thank you for including me and if you see a person fall, pick them up!

TL;DR: Had a jolly good time at the show."

Andrew Woolfolk, a longtime saxophone player for Earth, Wind & Fire, has died. In an Instagram post, Woolfolk’s Earth, Wind & Fire band mate Philip Bailey wrote that Woolfolk had been dealing with a serious illness for several years. He was 71. Pitchfork has contacted representatives for Earth, Wind & Fire for comment.

Woolfolk joined the band in 1972, sticking with the outfit through 1985. He re-joined the band when they returned from a hiatus in 1987 and kept his role until 1993. Bailey, who had known Woolfolk since their high school days, had recruited him to the group after the departure of Ronnie Laws. Woolfolk’s period with Earth, Wind & Fire covered much of their most celebrated material, including “September,” “Shining Star,” and “Boogie Wonderland.” He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the band in 2000.

Outside of Earth, Wind & Fire, Woolfolk worked as a session and touring player for other artists, including Bailey, Phil Collins, Level 42, and Deniece Williams."

It’s often hard to quantify the excesses of the rich and powerful. Sure, we can clock the total cost of a red carpet outfit, do some napkin math to figure out how much a big gala must have cost, or watch the super-mansion price listings like very jealous hawks. But for most of the things that separate the Famouses from us Normals, it’s very hard to get any kind of itemized listing of all the ways they’re just plain better than us mere mortals.

The exception to that rule, typically, is private jet use, on account of flight records being public knowledge that has to be logged with various airports—hence a whole little cottage industry of blogs and accounts that keep an eye on the flight times of the hoi polloi. And, now, a new Rolling Stone piece laying out some of the biggest private jet users in the world (and their subsequent carbon emissions), with Taylor Swift topping the list with 170 flights taken by her private jet this year so far, and counting.

Presumably realizing that the optics on this aren’t great—private jet flights are harder on the environment than almost any other action an individual can take (while still being a tiny fraction of the emissions put out by the fossil fuel industry, natch)—Swift’s team quickly issued a statement to Rolling Stone, clarifying that Swift isn’t even on most of those flights. Being a generous soul, she loans her jet out liberally, apparently, so she’s not the one taking the flights. (It’s…still her plane, though? We’re not actually sure how this statement helps, if we’re being honest.)

None of which has stopped a healthy crop of mocking jokes about Swift’s plane usage from popping up all over the place online today, in a very “My statement about how I don’t actually take a lot of private jet flights has a lot of people making fun of my private jet use” sort of way. (Many GIFs of random people riding in helicopters are involved.)

In addition to Swift, other folks named in the list (assembled by sustainability marketing company Yard, working with data scraped from Celebrity Jets) include professional athletes Floyd Mayweather (177 flights) and Alex Rodriguez (106 flights), as well as Jay-Z, who gets credited with all the flights taken by Puma’s private jet, because the brand apparently bought the plane at his suggestion. Others on the Top 10 of flight takers include Steven Spielberg, Blake Shelton, Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Mark Wahlberg, and Travis Scott, all of whom reportedly thus have carbon emissions footprints several hundred times higher than the average American’s."

The announcement of the show cancelations in Zurich and Milan was made on Clapton’s official Facebook page last night.



“Eric Clapton is unfortunately suffering from Covid having tested positive shortly after the second concert at the Royal Albert Hall,” the post reads.  He has been told by his medical advisors that if he were to resume traveling and performing too soon, it could substantially delay his full recovery. Eric is also anxious to avoid passing on any infection to any of his band, crew, Promoters, their staff and of course the fans.”



The performance in Zurich was scheduled for today, May 17, with Milan initially set for May 18. Clapton’s team says the guitarist hopes to resume the tour starting with the concerts in Bologna on May 20 and 21.



Clapton has been a prominent opponent of Covid protocols in the UK and the U.S., most notably the lockdowns and business closures enacted during the early days of the global pandemic. Clapton, who claimed last year that he experienced “disastrous” side effects – his hands and feet, he said, were “frozen, numb or burning, and pretty much useless for two weeks” – collaborated with singer Van Morrison in 2020 on the anti-lockdown song “Stand and Deliver,” which included the lyrics “Do you wanna wear these chains/ Until you’re lying in the grave?”



In his own song, “This Has Gotta Stop,” Clapton sang ” I knew that something was going on wrong/When you started laying down the law/I can’t move my hands…This has gotta stop/Enough is enough/I can’t take this BS any longer.” He subsequently subscribed to a conspiracy theory that vaccination was being encouraged through subliminal hypnosis and “mass psychosis.”


On his Facebook page last night, Clapton’s team wrote, “It is very frustrating that having avoided Covid throughout lockdown and throughout the period when travel restrictions have been in place Eric should have succumbed to Covid at this point in time, but we very much hope he will be sufficiently recovered by the end of the week to be able to perform the remainder of the planned performances.”



A further announcement will be made concerning the rescheduling of the postposed shows later.



Clapton recently announced North American tour dates for September, including stops in Columbus, Ohio; Chicago, Pittsburgh and two shows at New York City’s Madison Square Gardens.”

EDIT:


Hey y’all. According to the article he had received the vaccine, but supposedly sustained loss of feelings in his extremities.  I haven’t been able to find any other cases with this being the result but this is what he reported.

EDIT PT II:

Per  u/RadioFloydHead 

“Hang on. Let’s go a little deeper here…Clapton was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy (meaning loss of feeling in the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, which causes weakness, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet.) back in 2013.

There are reports of these symptoms in patients that took the COVID vaccine but also in patients that had the COVID virus, specifically “long COVID”. Out of tens of millions of people, there are only a small handful of these cases numbering in the hundreds.

Back to peripheral neuropathy… Prolonged alcohol and drug abuse is one of the most common causes. Also, things like smoking, not living a healthy lifestyle, liver disease, kidney disease, etc. are all major contributors as well.

Could the vaccine have exacerbated the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy? Possibly. Could COVID exacerbate the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy? Certainly, from what we know. Clapton’s doctors knew the risks with his pre-existing conditions and recommended the vaccine because, without it, COVID would have likely have taken his life, all things considered.

Regardless, what is more likely here? That the vaccine caused the effects he claimed or that it is was from something that was already there and getting worse with age. Occam’s Razor would suggest the latter.

I decided to publicly publish all my financial information for the past year. I am an independent musician, that creates instrumental guitar music. I am not bringing home the big bucks, but I feel I have enough information to give an accurate financial depiction. I have all the charts and screenshots published in an imgur link at the bottom of this post. If you check them out and believe that I am missing some valuable insight, please let me know and I can edit that information into this post. Let us begin.


I get my stats from the service DistroKid. Please do not think this is just an ad for distrokid, it s not. In fact, the reporting analytics are piss poor, which only allows me to give insight towards Itunes and Spotify. I can see the earnings from all the other services, but don’t have any stats streams/downloads etc.


**Itunes**. For every sale on Itunes I keep 77% of the sale. So $0.77 cents per song. I feel that is pretty fair for a behemoth such as Apple. Not much more to it than that, pretty straight forward. 


**Bandcamp** is a bit more complex. They say they take 15% as their cut from each sale, but after all the paypal fees, it comes out to be much less. When somebody buys my album of of bandcamp for $5.00, I get $3.90 in my paypal account. That is 78%, about the same as Itunes. Important to note however, the more somebody pays for an album the more this percentage goes up. If somebody pays $10 for an album, I get 8.06, so about 80%, but more or less the same. 


I offer my music for free on bandcamp, with the option to pay. This is just a personal preference, and I believe it fosters a better community of sharing and creation. My revenue from bandcamp (from my 2 album sales, not including individual song sales) has been $1,025. From that, 619 people downloaded them for free, and 160 decided to pay. If you break it down by revenue from total downloads, it comes out to be $1.31 per album. Of those who decided to pay, the average price that was chosen was $6.40. For the time being, I will continue to offer my music for free on bandcamp. I believe if people want it they will download it anyway, and I rather be in control of the channels that they are getting it from. 


Now for the Streaming.


**Spotify**. All in all I have had 176,548 streams on Spotify, which has yielded $706.02. This comes out to be $.004 a stream. This means for every million streams the artist gets paid $4,000. 


**Youtube**. I believe this is the biggest competitor to spotify. From 356,064 streams on Youtube, I have yielded $145.55. This is with every fucking ad option selected. That comes out to be $.0004 per stream. This comes out to be $400 per million streams. Also, keep in mind that a lot of the music on youtube is not on the artist's channels, in which case they are getting nothing. 


Unfortunately Distrokid analytics are not that great, so I can not provide any insight on the following services, but I can show you how much I made from each. I would be really interested to see the stream sats for Tidal and Google Play and Apple Music, to see how they relate to spotify. I will update everybody as soon as distrokid gets their shit together and I can report it.


* Itunes: $198.80
* Itunes Match: $0.29
* Apple Music: $36.44
* Spotify: $706.02
* Pandora: $0.33
* Deezer: $0.86
* Tidal: $5.49
* YT music: $1.00
* Groove Streaming: $0.09
* Groove Downloads: $0.70
* Google Play: $8.04
* Google Play all Access: $14.03
* Amazon: $28.26


I'll leave with this information and decide for yourself the best way to support artists. When I get updated statistics I will post them. Again, don’t think this is an ad for Distrokid. If anything this is a thinly veiled attempt to draw attention to my music by offering you something of value in return. 

I will also give you my opinion on the state of music. The music industry is far from dead, it just needs to adapt. I get so annoyed by musicians bitching about how they don’t get paid enough when comparing it to ten years ago. I heard someone say “I am getting paid fractions of a cent fort someone to hear my song, when they used to buy it for a dollar.” That logic just doesn't make sense. I feel like I don’t have to explain to benefit of rapid discovery that has come with the streaming industry. 


Also, buying physical copies of music is not dead in any sense. If anything the desire to own an artist's works has grown significantly, and we can see that in the rise in vinyl sales (I learned this in a reddit post the other day). I have sent fans prints of my album art (fans that have found me on spotify), and physical copies of my works as well. Vinyl is coming back in a good way. You know what they say, technology is cyclical. 


Thanks for checking this out. I hope you learned something from this, or at least it gave you a little bit of insight to something you already know a lot about. if you are curious in the music I make, my name is Samuel Orson and you can check out [my shit here](https://samuelorson.bandcamp.com)

The first concert I ever went to was Eric Clapton's Crossroads Tour, which was back in 1988.  I think I paid something like $20 for the ticket, and got decent seats, which, adjusted for inflation, is about $41 now.  Tickets were the same price throughout the whole stadium.  It all depended on how soon you got tickets.  So, some fan dedication was required to get good seats.

Yesterday, I got an email offering me pre-sales of Paul Simon tickets.  Being in my late 40s, and never having seen Paul Simon before, I figured it would be worth checking him out.

I click on the link and my choices are $47.50 for nose bleed crappy seats all the way through $175.00 for the VIP package, which includes seats up close.

I find those prices to be completely insane!

I used to be a big believer in supporting artists by going to see them live, and I always dreamed of being able to take my kids to concerts with me so we could all enjoy the live performance together.  But I just can't afford it any more.

Took my kids to see Imagine Dragons in concert 3 years ago, and we paid close to $200 for tickets and we were very high up.

Between the tickets and the service fees things have gotten out of hand.

Makes me sad.  I've seen Claptop, The Moody Blues (x3), Rush (x4), Jethro Tull (x2), The Kinks, Pat Benatar, Styx (x2), Richard Marx (remember him?), Jefferson Airplane, Emerson Lake and Palmer, The Who, Paul McCartney, The Beach Boys, Wilson-Phillips, Chicago, Cheap Trick, Weird Al (probably the best concert I have ever seen), The Hooters, Hall and Oates, Warren Zevon (probably the most boring concert I have ever been to), Yes, and a bunch of other artists who I am probably forgetting."

Check out this excerpt from the press release:  
     
> The agreement will replace the local agreements of the Norwegian, Finnish and Danish composers and songwriters’ societies, combining them in a single, joint agreement with Google. In the case of Koda, the national agreement for Denmark expired in April, after which it was temporarily extended – as is standard practice in the industry while negotiating a new agreement.  
  

> Now, however, Google have issued a new demand: if the agreement is to be temporarily extended, Koda must agree to reduce the payment provided to composers and songwriters for YouTube’s use of music by almost 70% – despite the fact that YouTube’s use of music has increased significantly since Koda entered into its last agreement with Google.

> Of course, Koda cannot accept these terms, and Google have now unilaterally decided that Koda’s members cannot have their content shown on YouTube and that their fans and users on YouTube will be unable to listen to Koda members’ music until a new agreement is in place.

I am completely awestruck as to how Google leverages their monopoly in this situation and is affecting an entire country.  
It is affecting artists directly and depriving listeners the possibility to listen to, and watch their favourite artists on YouTube."

We all sucked obviously, but it was a blast standing in a circle with all your friends spitting rhymes purely for entertainment.

In the seven years since then, I've dedicated an immense amount of time to honing the craft. It's amazing to me how far I've been able to come with the assistance and coaching of my two best friends, producers by the name of KIDYOUNOT and Wulfmanik.

I'm a little self conscious, but I'm releasing my second EP today, and I'm finally ready to show the world what we've made. I would adore any form of feedback, constructive criticism, or advice the community might have for me as a new(er) artist.

Here it is!

For any artist out there like me who have been working tirelessly for years but are just starting to put themselves out there, feel free to message me! I'd love to create something together, offer feedback, or really anything I could do for the community.

ALSO, one of my producers, KIDYOUNOT, is offering a free beat pack with the sound of the EP!

I wanted to share something I have been working on for years. I know its not much, but its a playlist I have been personally putting together for the past 4 years. Each song I stumbled upon has made me feel some type of emotion. It's become a love letter to lo-fi music lovers with a sprinkle of other genres. Its not meant to be played on shuffle. Instead just hit play. I painstakingly try to find a flow between songs that fit together and transition into another song.

I hope everyone enjoys it. I have really bad anxiety and depression, so this playlist means quite a lot to me and I hope it reaches the ears of others and gives them peace of mind too. (Added bonus, I suggest using rainymood to enhance the listening experience.)

Thank you!  


Edit:   
Holy guacamole! I went to bed last night after sharing this here. There were only a few comments before I went to sleep (which I was even surprised people commented then) and I never would have imagined so many people would commented or even like it. I really am blown away. There are a lot of questions and I have been reading every single one of them.

Firstly, I want to thank everyone for listening to what little playlist I put together over the years. I know its small in comparison to the other playlists out there that has more exposure or better selection of music. Seeing so many comments and thank yous from everyone really cheered me up this morning and even made me cry. Yeah, I'm an emotional wreck, but I just never even considered people would find what I put so much time into to be worth listening to.

Here is a little origin story to it all. The playlist started back in 2014. 2014 was probably the hardest year for me. Nothing ever went right and some inner demons that was manifesting in ways that made me feel all out of sorts. I've always dealt with depression for years and music plus video games has always been the coping method of choice for me. It was like a gateway out of everything. It helped me escape my thoughts. At my lowest I had thought about things I did as a kid. Instead of being a social butterfly, I was usually in my room and listening to the radio and fumbling with old worn out cassette tapes trying to record songs off the radio that I liked and matched together-- struggling to wait out advertisements between songs. So to calm me down, I decided to do the same thing digitally with Spotify. Hence this playlist ""Thoughtful"" was created. I revisit this playlist from time to time to add, take away, put back, and reposition songs with a fresh set of ears. Its tedious, but I want it all to flow continuously without being jarring. Its like a little hobby of mine. One method I stick to is: Never add more than 1 to 2 songs per artist at max and never full albums. If people had ever found my playlist, I wanted them  to get a taste of an artist and become curious enough about them to search them and listen to more.  Every song, I have listened to multiple times and found the perfect order (for me at least) to sew and stitch them in.

As for technical issues. I'm not a computer expert so I don't know why the playlist won't open for some users. I never used iTunes or Google Music, I wish I could help.Here are a few more links if its useful:

The other day 3 songs from one of my favorite small bands came up nearly one after the other and I sent screenshots to my buddy who was the singer in the band basically telling him he was welcome for the money I was making him on Pandora.

He told me he makes about $.01 per stream of his songs.

I don't think I'm surprised by that, but I immediately felt like I should go buy his album off iTunes, because, well, here I was at work, enjoying his work, for basically free.

But I have the album.  What I really wanted was to just throw him a few bucks for letting me listen to his songs.

I don't know if this is a good idea, or if it's been tried before to failure, but had there been a 'tip jar' option there, I'd have sent him a few dollars.

Anyone else think that would be a good idea or was I just feeling like being a nice person because I felt guilty about enjoying my friends work for free?

* edit quote to quite

**UPDATE - Had a couple ask for the band - wasn't sure if I could/should post it, but here is who I was listening to when I was thinking about it.**

I was too lazy to read the rules of the sub and didn't know if it would be considered promoting and get banned.  (still don't)

Band's name is/was Resident Hero, they toured with FlyLeaf and Ryan White, the lead singer often did a lot of duet work with Lindsey, the lead singer of FlyLeaf.  (I think that's her name).

Great song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tz8N4p9UyQ

**UPDATE 2**

Front page, huh?  That's pretty cool.  I hope it's because a lot of people would use it to tip their bands.  A lot of comments about how this already exists on other sites, which is great.  The problem is... that I like pop music.  I like top 40's.  I prefer to listen to that primarily, and have the old indie stuff and touring bands in there, too.  I like Pandora because it does that, the smaller platforms that have been mentioned don't really offer that.  And to really make some decent money for these artists, they need a platform that's as omnipresent as Pandora or Spotify - I'm on the internet all day long, and I've never heard of some of these other platforms that were mentioned, but SHOULD be more widely known, so I'm going to post the ones I saw here:

http://huzza.io - cool idea - i actually signed up for the beta based on the comment below
https://www.patreon.com/
http://peertracks.com/
http://noisetrade.com/
http://help.grooveshark.com/customer/portal/articles/669416-flattr - this is interesting, and pretty close to what i was talking about.  I wish I liked Grooveshark more and as near as I can tell, they don't have a mobile app...

There were a lot of comments about Pandora not taking any fees for this service.  I disagree with that because someone has to build it and maintain it and manage it and audit it, and I think those people should be paid for their services.  

Someone said they sent it to their girlfriend that works at Pandora - that's awesome, I wish I'd chosen a less offensive username; I literally have no idea why I picked that."

Also worth mentioning that this track was released exclusively through MySpace for a little over a week before it was available on iTunes. Nothing says 2006 like MySpace and MCR.

vpu8jl,Beck reveals that he denied Weird Al’s “Loser” parody back in the ‘90s and regrets it to this day,14557,0.96,659,2022-07-02 20:59:58,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/vpu8jl/beck_reveals_that_he_denied_weird_als_loser/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/vpu8jl/beck_reveals_that_he_denied_weird_als_loser/,self.Music,0,1,,text,False,False,False,"Article: https://www.stereogum.com/2191860/beck-denied-weird-als-loser-parody-back-in-the-90s/

Beck did not want “Weird Al” Yankovic to turn his song into a joke. Back in the ’90s, when Beck first broke through with his out-of-nowhere hit “Loser,” Yankovic said that he wanted to parody the song. Yankovic doesn’t need to ask artists’ permission, since parodies are protected under the First Amendment, but he always does it as a courtesy, and Beck said no. Today, Beck says that he regrets the decision.

As Billboard reports, Beck has a podcast coming out as part of Audible’s Words + Music series. In his episode, which he’s called “Dear Life,” Beck tells some of the stories of his career. At SXSW this year, Beck mentioned that he had re-recorded new versions of his hits “Loser” and “Where It’s At,” and he did that for this podcast. Billboard has a clip of the first episode, and it features the re-recorded “Loser,” which now sounds considerably less ramshackle, as well as the story about “Weird Al” Yankovic. Beck says that Yankovic wanted to call the parody “Schmoozer.” Beck turned it down because he was afraid that he wasn’t being taken seriously.

In the clip, Beck has this to say:

I had a lot of people who were veterans in the business telling me at 20, 21, 22, “You should go back to school. You don’t really have the talent to do this. The songs, as they are, aren’t going to work. They’re too rough. They’re too raw. They’re not real songs. These are kind of, like, sort of hodgepodge ideas.” It wasn’t really taken seriously at all. And when it came out and it was popular, it still wasn’t taken that serious at all.

I mean, you can go back to the press of the day. I just remember myriad articles and headlines of “one-hit wonder joke band Beck,” “novelty act.” I remember there was a review in a big paper in LA once, and it was not a lot of kindness. I felt very dismissed and kind of, like, a bit of a footnote.

“Weird Al” Yankovic tried to do a parody of [“Loser”]. It was going to be called “Schmoozer,” which I regret denying him permission to do. It would’ve been an amazing video. I’m actually really sad that it didn’t happen."
vvpdu3,"Can anyone explain to me the appeal of modern rappers like Playboi Carti, Lil Uzi Vert , Travis Scott... ?",14523,0.72,5050,2022-07-10 16:50:45,Music,34670194,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/vvpdu3/can_anyone_explain_to_me_the_appeal_of_modern/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/vvpdu3/can_anyone_explain_to_me_the_appeal_of_modern/,self.Music,0,44,,text,False,False,False,"I really don't get it. To me, it's mediocre, bad singing/rapping, uninteresting, nonsensical/misogynist texts.. I can only see an interest in the production value of what 'they' do, but I don't even think that those people make their own beats.

Edit: I've read all the answers so far, and thank you all. A few things I have to add:

This post is by no means derogatory to the people who enjoy their music. It doesn't come either from a perspective of ' i have such great tastes, this is peasant music'

The rap/hip-hop world is a little bit out of my grasp, hence why often, I just cannot rely to it. That's why I have the point of view of an external observer, who is curious to understand the how's and the why's. 

That being said, I do enjoy a lot of rap artists, modern or old. Tyler the Creator is one, Asap Rocky is another... 

I'm not looking for particularly deep or meaningful or skillfully musicianship when I'm listening to music. I enjoy a lot of un-serious artists as well

I was just curious, because those modern rap artists are like super-popular, revered by millions. And I feel alienated from that. So I'm interested in understanding the narrative behind it: what do those people stand for? Why did they become famous in the first place? What do they represent for people who actually enjoy them beyond the hedonistic and fun aspect? When I'm talking about the artists I really like, I can get really passionate about it and talk about music for hours, beyond the 'to each their own' "

EDIT 3: found iowa racist beatdown/ jail gravy vid lol this is embarrassing [https://streamable.com/rd8og](https://streamable.com/rd8og)

EDIT 4: i typed out this whole long story but it wont show up in the comments and i'm sick of telling this story lol:

""alright so both times i got arrested in Georgia were super lame. the first time, i was at a house party in this super sus deep south/incesty part of Georgia (sorry for stereotyping, its probably decent, i just met the wrong people there.) it was on the same river where Deliverance takes place if that helps you picture it. didn’t know the kid whose party it was but there was like 12 of us there. his mom found out and called the cops, saying there were burglars in her house. the kid was super xanned out and didn't tell anybody that she called. that town gets no crime love at all so the police department got all excited and sent 7 cops to the house with dogs etc. we were drunk and underage (i just turned 18) so we all ran and hid in the woods. I was hiding in various parts of this huge backyard for probably 5 hours, hearing my friends get picked off one at a time in little bouts of screaming, barking, and of course the lovely cops screaming the “hard R” at my friends. I managed to get out of the neighborhood, ran like 3 miles, and started hitchhiking, when my boy who was at the house calls me. I pick it up and its a cop saying “Hi Matthew, your friend ratted you out and we know your name and address. We aren’t gonna stop looking for you.” (it was the kid i didn’t know that snitched, not any of my friends) So I gave up and told him where I was. I’m standing in the middle of the road with my hands up, and this cop has the audacity to jump out of his car with his gun out screaming “get on the ground you f-ing yankee” and shoves my face into the street while handcuffing me. they put me in a separate cell from all the other kids and wouldn’t stop calling me Yankee lol it felt like it was the 1800s or something. I got charged with 2 counts of burglary, 2 counts of criminal trespassing, and felonies for xan and wax. Luckily i got a good lawyer and wasn’t actually guilty of any of those things, so i ended up with 2 misdemeanors - criminal trespassing and underage drinking. I talked about it in more detail in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGuRF8F0ruM&t=38s).

the second arrest was for breaking into a tire store in Buckhead, because this kid i met at a bar told me his dad owned it and i was too drunk to think twice when he forced open the door with a shovel.

that first arrest was the reason for the probation experience i mentioned in 1 thot 2 thot. i had to do 240 hours of community service, so i moved in with my friend who owns a thrift shop in Montana to finesse some extra hours / get away from my bad influence friends in Minnesota. I worked 10 hours every single day for 24 days straight. The last day when i got off i was so hyped i went home and wrote 1 thot 2 thot in like 30 minutes. got a bottle of cognac and went to the studio that night (: GRAVY OFF PROBATION

p.s. jail in iowa is way better than jail in georgia"""

Best listened to on shuffle.

Mostly alternative rock/folk/electronic/pop.

The show is only once a week, and I've only been at it for a couple months, so the playlist is still growing. I'm always happy to take recommendations as long as they fit the <2k format and are daytime radio friendly!

Disclaimer: Some songs may have risen above 2k total plays since I last aired them, but I feel the general philosophy of artist exposure and music discovery still applies.

Also! You can see that some of the songs are greyed out, that's because these aren't actually on Spotify, and I found them on the band's bandcamp page. These get a special recommendation from me and I totally encourage anyone interested to look them up.

Edit: I don't have time to respond to everyone's recommendations, but I'm going through them bit by bit! I might not reply, but that doesn't mean I haven't added it!

Edit 2: A few have asked, so you can listen live on [kbga](http://kbga.org/)! My show is Fridays 2-4pm Mountain Time. (If plugging this violates a rule or something, I'll take it down).

Final Edit: Thanks everyone for the recommendations! I can't possibly get through them all in any reasonable amount of time, but I've made it my personal mission to take a look at every one of them at some point. I won't be running out of content for the show any time soon!

Lastly, this is mostly a playlist of *songs I've already aired* (plus a few from this thread and before that I accidentally added prematurely). I have a separate playlist for songs yet-to-be-aired that rotate into this one as a kind of archive, so this playlist updates every Friday after the show! If you don't see your recommendation right away, it might show up after a show!

In a recent interview with Reader's Digest, the Beatles legend said he's effectively imposed a ban on signing mementos and taking haphazard selfies with fans.

""It always struck me as a bit strange — 'here, can I write your name down on the back of this till receipt please?' Why? We both know who I am,"" Macca said, adding that he doesn't understand the appeal of grainy selfies, either. But don't mistake these brush-offs for arrogance; the 79-year-old songwriting icon just wants to take that precious time to get to know his fans on a more personal level, instead. ""What you've usually got is a ropey photo with a poor backdrop and me looking a bit miserable,"" he went on. ""Let's chat, let's exchange stories.""

McCartney follows his Beatles bandmate Sir Ringo Starr, who in 2008 announced he'd cease autographs and would no longer be accepting fan mail, citing that memorabilia with his signature was often resold for a profit. ""I'm warning you with peace and love, I have too much to do,"" the drummer said in a video message shared to fans. ""So no more fan mail, thank you, thank you, and no objects to be signed. Nothing.""

She decided to sue the airing company Canvas because 'Lady Gaga' is a registered trademark. Which is ironic, since Lady Gaga (and the station's name) is derived from the Queens song Radio Ga Ga or just the word 'gaga', meaning crazy or nuts. 

Gaga argues that Radio Gaga gives the impression the program would be about the superstar herself. In fact, the program is just a human-interest show, having nothing to do with Gaga.

Ever since then I’ve been completely obsessed with it. 

It is, without a doubt, the most atmospheric and immersive album I’ve probably ever heard. From beginning to end, it wraps you in this inky black embrace. It legit feels like the soundtrack to a weird nightmare you can’t wake up from. But it’s also kind of…really sexy and sensual in a dark and eerie kind of way. The production is just nuts. I’ve been listening to it with some high end headphones and man, you can just get totally lost in these songs. There’s just so much going on but at the same time, the songs on the surface sound sparse and minimalistic. The vibes, as the kids say, are immaculate. 

I’ve been reading some reviews of the album here and there and it seems like the consensus is that the opening quartet of songs is the peak of the album, and I really can’t disagree. That stretch of Angel-Risingson-Teardrop-Inertia Creeps is just mind-blowing. The rest of the album is actually incredible as well but these first four songs are just on another level. Really though, this is all-killer, no filler. Every track is really, really good even at their worst and I’d probably put The Man Next Door up there with the first four tracks. 

It’s crazy how this album sounds out of time almost - like nothing else I’ve heard in the eras before or since it came out. It is very much its own thing - a darkly beautiful epic."

Artist Danny Quirk (who's a local from my area) first started seeing madonna using his artwork on instagram which didn't spark much of a reaction untill he started seeing the images being used [on her Rebel Heart tour.](http://www.diyphotography.net/artist-annoyed-at-madonna-using-his-work-and-claiming-fair-use-to-avoid-payment/)

[Here's the side by side comparision](http://i.imgur.com/H472YSM.jpg) of his artwork next to Madonnas atrocity.

This is not her first time doing this either, she's also done this to artist Jonas Jödicke, where she again [copy and pasted her face on his original piece of art](http://i.imgur.com/06r7nfe.jpg).

Their efforts to contact her have lead to a brick wall, and they've heard absolutely nothing back. 

Danny Quirk isn't even looking for compensation so much that he's looking for recognition. He's not a wealthy artist and like many of us - has tons of student bills from college. Recognition from madonna and getting his name out their would do wonders for his career.

I wonder if this is an unspoken business strategy; big artists preying on smaller artists for material without providing compensation.

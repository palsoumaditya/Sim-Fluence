7e1jo1,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,124372,0.81,10861,2017-11-19 21:54:07,science,32725688,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7e1jo1/raising_the_taxes_of_graduate_students_by_as_much/,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7e1jo1/raising_the_taxes_of_graduate_students_by_as_much/,self.science,0,7,,text,False,False,False,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

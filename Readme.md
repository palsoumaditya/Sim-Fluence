## Overview

Sim-Fluence is an AI-powered content testing platform that uses agent-based simulation and social graph modeling to forecast how real audiences might react to your content before you publish it. By simulating human reactions, predicting content virality, generating realistic feedback, and mapping influence spread, Sim-Fluence helps content creators, marketers, and businesses make data-driven decisions about their content strategy.

## Features

### Simulate Human Reactions
Our platform models real people as AI agents, each with their own persona, preferences, and network connections.

### Predict Content Virality
Estimate how likely your post or idea is to go viral based on simulated engagement patterns across different audience segments.

### Generate Realistic Feedback
Receive authentic comments, likes/dislikes, and suggestions from the perspective of AI agents that mirror your target audience.

### Map Influence Spread
Visualize how your content would flow and get shared across a social network through peer influence and engagement patterns.

## Demo

Visit our [live demo](https://sim-fluence-demo.vercel.app) to see Sim-Fluence in action.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Google API key for Gemini access

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sim-fluence.git
   cd sim-fluence/Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the Frontend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the Backend directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage

### Creating a Simulation

1. Log in to your Sim-Fluence account
2. Navigate to the "New Simulation" page
3. Upload or input your content
4. Configure your target audience parameters
5. Start the simulation
6. Review the results and insights

### Interpreting Results

The simulation results provide several key metrics:

- **Engagement Score**: Overall measure of audience interaction
- **Virality Potential**: Likelihood of content spreading widely
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, or neutral reception
- **Audience Segments**: Breakdown of how different demographics respond
- **Suggested Improvements**: AI-generated recommendations for content optimization

## Architecture

Sim-Fluence is built with a modern tech stack:

### Frontend
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk for authentication

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- Google Gemini API for agent simulation and content analysis

### Infrastructure
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Railway/Heroku for backend services
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## AI Integration

Sim-Fluence leverages Google's Gemini AI models to:

- Create realistic agent personas with diverse preferences and behaviors
- Generate human-like responses to content
- Analyze sentiment and engagement patterns
- Predict content performance across different audience segments
- Provide actionable insights for content optimization

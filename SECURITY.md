# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping ensure Sim-Fluence remains secure. We take all security concerns seriously.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Sim-Fluence, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** or to any third parties
2. Submit your report directly to our security team via email at [soumadityapal@outlook.com](mailto:soumadityapal@outlook.com)
3. If the above channels are unavailable, you may contact a project maintainer via DM

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any proof-of-concept code, if applicable
- Your name and contact information (optional, for recognition purposes)
- Any suggestions for remediation if available

### Response Timeline

We are committed to the following response timeline:
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 14 days
- **Vulnerability Resolution**: Timeline will depend on severity and complexity

## Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities according to the following criteria:

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical | Immediate threat to core services; potential for significant data breach |
| High     | Significant vulnerability with potential for limited data exposure |
| Medium   | Vulnerability with moderate impact requiring user interaction |
| Low      | Minor issues with minimal security impact |

## Scope

We consider the following issues to be within the scope of our security policy:

- Remote code execution
- SQL injection
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Business logic vulnerabilities with security implications
- Server configuration issues
- Insecure direct object references
- Security misconfigurations
- Broken access control
- Cryptographic failures

## Out of Scope

The following are typically not considered security vulnerabilities:

- Rate limiting issues that don't lead to security vulnerabilities
- Spam or social engineering attacks
- Self-XSS requiring significant user interaction
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device
- Issues in third-party applications that use Sim-Fluence but are not under our control
- Descriptive error messages
- Missing HTTP security headers that don't lead to vulnerabilities
- Brute force attacks without evidence of implementation flaws
- Vulnerabilities in outdated or unsupported browsers or platforms

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not take legal action against security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, or service interruption
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to confirm the issue
- Report vulnerabilities directly to us and allow a reasonable time for remediation
- Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Do not conduct denial of service testing or other testing that impairs access to or damages a system or data

## Recognition

We believe in acknowledging the valuable contributions of security researchers. With your permission, we will recognize your efforts in our security acknowledgments after the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Security Updates

We regularly update our dependencies and conduct security audits. Information about security-related updates will be published in our release notes and, when appropriate, directly communicated to our users.

## Encryption and Data Protection

Sim-Fluence implements industry-standard encryption protocols to protect data in transit and at rest. We follow best practices for secure data handling and storage.
